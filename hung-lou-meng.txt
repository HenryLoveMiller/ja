PREFACE.
This translation was suggested not by any pretensions to range myselfamong the ranks of the body of sinologues, but by the perplexities anddifficulties experienced by me as a student in Peking, when, at thecompletion of the Tzu Erh Chi, I had to plunge in the maze of the HungLou Meng.
Shortcomings are, I feel sure, to be discovered, both in the prose, aswell as among the doggerel and uncouth rhymes, in which the text hasbeen more adhered to than rhythm; but I shall feel satisfied with theresult, if I succeed, even in the least degree, in affording a helpinghand to present and future students of the Chinese language.

THE DREAM OF THE RED CHAMBER.

CHAPTER I.
  Chen Shih-yin, in a vision, apprehends perception and spirituality.  Chia Y�-ts'un, in the (windy and dusty) world, cherishes fond thoughts      of a beautiful maiden.
This is the opening section; this the first chapter. Subsequent to thevisions of a dream which he had, on some previous occasion, experienced,the writer personally relates, he designedly concealed the truecircumstances, and borrowed the attributes of perception andspirituality to relate this story of the Record of the Stone. With thispurpose, he made use of such designations as Chen Shih-yin (truth underthe garb of fiction) and the like. What are, however, the eventsrecorded in this work? Who are the dramatis personae?
Wearied with the drudgery experienced of late in the world, the authorspeaking for himself, goes on to explain, with the lack of success whichattended every single concern, I suddenly bethought myself of thewomankind of past ages. Passing one by one under a minute scrutiny, Ifelt that in action and in lore, one and all were far above me; that inspite of the majesty of my manliness, I could not, in point of fact,compare with these characters of the gentle sex. And my shame forsooththen knew no bounds; while regret, on the other hand, was of no avail,as there was not even a remote possibility of a day of remedy.
On this very day it was that I became desirous to compile, in aconnected form, for publication throughout the world, with a view to(universal) information, how that I bear inexorable and manifoldretribution; inasmuch as what time, by the sustenance of the benevolenceof Heaven, and the virtue of my ancestors, my apparel was rich and fine,and as what days my fare was savory and sumptuous, I disregarded thebounty of education and nurture of father and mother, and paid no heedto the virtue of precept and injunction of teachers and friends, withthe result that I incurred the punishment, of failure recently in theleast trifle, and the reckless waste of half my lifetime. There havebeen meanwhile, generation after generation, those in the innerchambers, the whole mass of whom could not, on any account, be, throughmy influence, allowed to fall into extinction, in order that I, unfilialas I have been, may have the means to screen my own shortcomings.
Hence it is that the thatched shed, with bamboo mat windows, the bed oftow and the stove of brick, which are at present my share, are notsufficient to deter me from carrying out the fixed purpose of my mind.And could I, furthermore, confront the morning breeze, the evening moon,the willows by the steps and the flowers in the courtyard, methinksthese would moisten to a greater degree my mortal pen with ink; butthough I lack culture and erudition, what harm is there, however, inemploying fiction and unrecondite language to give utterance to themerits of these characters? And were I also able to induce the inmatesof the inner chamber to understand and diffuse them, could I besidesbreak the weariness of even so much as a single moment, or could I openthe eyes of my contemporaries, will it not forsooth prove a boon?
This consideration has led to the usage of such names as Chia Y�-ts'unand other similar appellations.
More than any in these pages have been employed such words as dreams andvisions; but these dreams constitute the main argument of this work, andcombine, furthermore, the design of giving a word of warning to myreaders.
Reader, can you suggest whence the story begins?
The narration may border on the limits of incoherency and triviality,but it possesses considerable zest. But to begin.
The Empress N� Wo, (the goddess of works,) in fashioning blocks ofstones, for the repair of the heavens, prepared, at the Ta Huang Hillsand Wu Ch'i cave, 36,501 blocks of rough stone, each twelve chang inheight, and twenty-four chang square. Of these stones, the Empress Woonly used 36,500; so that one single block remained over and above,without being turned to any account. This was cast down the Ch'ing Kengpeak. This stone, strange to say, after having undergone a process ofrefinement, attained a nature of efficiency, and could, by its innatepowers, set itself into motion and was able to expand and to contract.
When it became aware that the whole number of blocks had been made useof to repair the heavens, that it alone had been destitute of thenecessary properties and had been unfit to attain selection, itforthwith felt within itself vexation and shame, and day and night, itgave way to anguish and sorrow.
One day, while it lamented its lot, it suddenly caught sight, at a greatdistance, of a Buddhist bonze and of a Taoist priest coming towards thatdirection. Their appearance was uncommon, their easy manner remarkable.When they drew near this Ch'ing Keng peak, they sat on the ground torest, and began to converse. But on noticing the block newly-polishedand brilliantly clear, which had moreover contracted in dimensions, andbecome no larger than the pendant of a fan, they were greatly filledwith admiration. The Buddhist priest picked it up, and laid it in thepalm of his hand.
"Your appearance," he said laughingly, "may well declare you to be asupernatural object, but as you lack any inherent quality it isnecessary to inscribe a few characters on you, so that every one whoshall see you may at once recognise you to be a remarkable thing. Andsubsequently, when you will be taken into a country where honour andaffluence will reign, into a family cultured in mind and of officialstatus, in a land where flowers and trees shall flourish withluxuriance, in a town of refinement, renown and glory; when you oncewill have been there..."
The stone listened with intense delight.
"What characters may I ask," it consequently inquired, "will youinscribe? and what place will I be taken to? pray, pray explain to me inlucid terms." "You mustn't be inquisitive," the bonze replied, with asmile, "in days to come you'll certainly understand everything." Havingconcluded these words, he forthwith put the stone in his sleeve, andproceeded leisurely on his journey, in company with the Taoist priest.Whither, however, he took the stone, is not divulged. Nor can it beknown how many centuries and ages elapsed, before a Taoist priest, K'ungK'ung by name, passed, during his researches after the eternal reasonand his quest after immortality, by these Ta Huang Hills, Wu Ch'i caveand Ch'ing Keng Peak. Suddenly perceiving a large block of stone, on thesurface of which the traces of characters giving, in a connected form,the various incidents of its fate, could be clearly deciphered, K'ungK'ung examined them from first to last. They, in fact, explained howthat this block of worthless stone had originally been devoid of theproperties essential for the repairs to the heavens, how it would betransmuted into human form and introduced by Mang Mang the High Lord,and Miao Miao, the Divine, into the world of mortals, and how it wouldbe led over the other bank (across the San Sara). On the surface, therecord of the spot where it would fall, the place of its birth, as wellas various family trifles and trivial love affairs of young ladies,verses, odes, speeches and enigmas was still complete; but the name ofthe dynasty and the year of the reign were obliterated, and could not beascertained.
On the obverse, were also the following enigmatical verses:
  Lacking in virtues meet the azure skies to mend,  In vain the mortal world full many a year I wend,  Of a former and after life these facts that be,  Who will for a tradition strange record for me?
K'ung K'ung, the Taoist, having pondered over these lines for a while,became aware that this stone had a history of some kind.
"Brother stone," he forthwith said, addressing the stone, "the concernsof past days recorded on you possess, according to your own account, aconsiderable amount of interest, and have been for this reasoninscribed, with the intent of soliciting generations to hand them downas remarkable occurrences. But in my own opinion, they lack, in thefirst place, any data by means of which to establish the name of theEmperor and the year of his reign; and, in the second place, theseconstitute no record of any excellent policy, adopted by any highworthies or high loyal statesmen, in the government of the state, or inthe rule of public morals. The contents simply treat of a certain numberof maidens, of exceptional character; either of their love affairs orinfatuations, or of their small deserts or insignificant talents; andwere I to transcribe the whole collection of them, they would,nevertheless, not be estimated as a book of any exceptional worth."
"Sir Priest," the stone replied with assurance, "why are you soexcessively dull? The dynasties recorded in the rustic histories, whichhave been written from age to age, have, I am fain to think, invariablyassumed, under false pretences, the mere nomenclature of the Han andT'ang dynasties. They differ from the events inscribed on my block,which do not borrow this customary practice, but, being based on my ownexperiences and natural feelings, present, on the contrary, a novel andunique character. Besides, in the pages of these rustic histories,either the aspersions upon sovereigns and statesmen, or the stricturesupon individuals, their wives, and their daughters, or the deeds oflicentiousness and violence are too numerous to be computed. Indeed,there is one more kind of loose literature, the wantonness and pollutionin which work most easy havoc upon youth.
"As regards the works, in which the characters of scholars and beautiesis delineated their allusions are again repeatedly of Wen Ch�n, theirtheme in every page of Tzu Chien; a thousand volumes present nodiversity; and a thousand characters are but a counterpart of eachother. What is more, these works, throughout all their pages, cannothelp bordering on extreme licence. The authors, however, had no otherobject in view than to give utterance to a few sentimental odes andelegant ballads of their own, and for this reason they have fictitiouslyinvented the names and surnames of both men and women, and necessarilyintroduced, in addition, some low characters, who should, like a buffoonin a play, create some excitement in the plot.
"Still more loathsome is a kind of pedantic and profligate literature,perfectly devoid of all natural sentiment, full of self-contradictions;and, in fact, the contrast to those maidens in my work, whom I have,during half my lifetime, seen with my own eyes and heard with my ownears. And though I will not presume to estimate them as superior to theheroes and heroines in the works of former ages, yet the perusal of themotives and issues of their experiences, may likewise afford mattersufficient to banish dulness, and to break the spell of melancholy.
"As regards the several stanzas of doggerel verse, they may too evokesuch laughter as to compel the reader to blurt out the rice, and tospurt out the wine.
"In these pages, the scenes depicting the anguish of separation, thebliss of reunion, and the fortunes of prosperity and of adversity areall, in every detail, true to human nature, and I have not taken uponmyself to make the slightest addition, or alteration, which might leadto the perversion of the truth.
"My only object has been that men may, after a drinking bout, or afterthey wake from sleep or when in need of relaxation from the pressure ofbusiness, take up this light literature, and not only expunge the tracesof antiquated books, and obtain a new kind of distraction, but that theymay also lay by a long life as well as energy and strength; for it bearsno point of similarity to those works, whose designs are false, whosecourse is immoral. Now, Sir Priest, what are your views on the subject?"
K'ung K'ung having pondered for a while over the words, to which he hadlistened intently, re-perused, throughout, this record of the stone; andfinding that the general purport consisted of nought else than atreatise on love, and likewise of an accurate transcription of facts,without the least taint of profligacy injurious to the times, hethereupon copied the contents, from beginning to end, to the intent ofcharging the world to hand them down as a strange story.
Hence it was that K'ung K'ung, the Taoist, in consequence of hisperception, (in his state of) abstraction, of passion, the generation,from this passion, of voluptuousness, the transmission of thisvoluptuousness into passion, and the apprehension, by means of passion,of its unreality, forthwith altered his name for that of "Ch'ing Tseng"(the Voluptuous Bonze), and changed the title of "the Memoir of a Stone"(Shih-t'ou-chi,) for that of "Ch'ing Tseng Lu," The Record of theVoluptuous Bonze; while K'ung Mei-chi of Tung Lu gave it the name of"Feng Y�eh Pao Chien," "The Precious Mirror of Voluptuousness." In lateryears, owing to the devotion by Tsao Hs�eh-ch'in in the Tao Hung study,of ten years to the perusal and revision of the work, the additions andmodifications effected by him five times, the affix of an index and thedivision into periods and chapters, the book was again entitled "ChinLing Shih Erh Ch'ai," "The Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling." A stanza wasfurthermore composed for the purpose. This then, and no other, is theorigin of the Record of the Stone. The poet says appositely:--
  Pages full of silly litter,  Tears a handful sour and bitter;  All a fool the author hold,  But their zest who can unfold?
You have now understood the causes which brought about the Record of theStone, but as you are not, as yet, aware what characters are depicted,and what circumstances are related on the surface of the block, reader,please lend an ear to the narrative on the stone, which runs asfollows:--
In old days, the land in the South East lay low. In this South-East partof the world, was situated a walled town, Ku Su by name. Within thewalls a locality, called the Ch'ang Men, was more than all othersthroughout the mortal world, the centre, which held the second, if notthe first place for fashion and life. Beyond this Ch'ang Men was astreet called Shih-li-chieh (Ten _Li_ street); in this street a lane,the Jen Ch'ing lane (Humanity and Purity); and in this lane stood an oldtemple, which on account of its diminutive dimensions, was called, bygeneral consent, the Gourd temple. Next door to this temple lived thefamily of a district official, Chen by surname, Fei by name, andShih-yin by style. His wife, n�e Feng, possessed a worthy and virtuousdisposition, and had a clear perception of moral propriety and goodconduct. This family, though not in actual possession of excessiveaffluence and honours, was, nevertheless, in their district, conceded tobe a clan of well-to-do standing. As this Chen Shih-yin was of acontented and unambitious frame of mind, and entertained no hankeringafter any official distinction, but day after day of his life tookdelight in gazing at flowers, planting bamboos, sipping his wine andconning poetical works, he was in fact, in the indulgence of thesepursuits, as happy as a supernatural being.
One thing alone marred his happiness. He had lived over half a centuryand had, as yet, no male offspring around his knees. He had one onlychild, a daughter, whose infant name was Ying Lien. She was just threeyears of age. On a long summer day, on which the heat had been intense,Shih-yin sat leisurely in his library. Feeling his hand tired, hedropped the book he held, leant his head on a teapoy, and fell asleep.
Of a sudden, while in this state of unconsciousness, it seemed as if hehad betaken himself on foot to some spot or other whither he could notdiscriminate. Unexpectedly he espied, in the opposite direction, twopriests coming towards him: the one a Buddhist, the other a Taoist. Asthey advanced they kept up the conversation in which they were engaged."Whither do you purpose taking the object you have brought away?" heheard the Taoist inquire. To this question the Buddhist replied with asmile: "Set your mind at ease," he said; "there's now in maturity a plotof a general character involving mundane pleasures, which will presentlycome to a denouement. The whole number of the votaries of voluptuousnesshave, as yet, not been quickened or entered the world, and I mean toavail myself of this occasion to introduce this object among theirnumber, so as to give it a chance to go through the span of humanexistence." "The votaries of voluptuousness of these days will naturallyhave again to endure the ills of life during their course through themortal world," the Taoist remarked; "but when, I wonder, will theyspring into existence? and in what place will they descend?"
"The account of these circumstances," the bonze ventured to reply, "isenough to make you laugh! They amount to this: there existed in thewest, on the bank of the Ling (spiritual) river, by the side of the SanSheng (thrice-born) stone, a blade of the Chiang Chu (purple pearl)grass. At about the same time it was that the block of stone was,consequent upon its rejection by the goddess of works, also left toramble and wander to its own gratification, and to roam about atpleasure to every and any place. One day it came within the precincts ofthe Ching Huan (Monitory Vision) Fairy; and this Fairy, cognizant of thefact that this stone had a history, detained it, therefore, to reside atthe Ch'ih Hsia (purple clouds) palace, and apportioned to it the dutiesof attendant on Shen Ying, a fairy of the Ch'ih Hsia palace.
"This stone would, however, often stroll along the banks of the Lingriver, and having at the sight of the blade of spiritual grass beenfilled with admiration, it, day by day, moistened its roots with sweetdew. This purple pearl grass, at the outset, tarried for months andyears; but being at a later period imbued with the essence andluxuriance of heaven and earth, and having incessantly received themoisture and nurture of the sweet dew, divested itself, in course oftime, of the form of a grass; assuming, in lieu, a human nature, whichgradually became perfected into the person of a girl.
"Every day she was wont to wander beyond the confines of the Li Hen(divested animosities) heavens. When hungry she fed on the Pi Ch'ing(hidden love) fruit--when thirsty she drank the Kuan ch'ou (dischargedsorrows,) water. Having, however, up to this time, not shewn hergratitude for the virtue of nurture lavished upon her, the result wasbut natural that she should resolve in her heart upon a constant andincessant purpose to make suitable acknowledgment.
"I have been," she would often commune within herself, "the recipient ofthe gracious bounty of rain and dew, but I possess no such water as waslavished upon me to repay it! But should it ever descend into the worldin the form of a human being, I will also betake myself thither, alongwith it; and if I can only have the means of making restitution to it,with the tears of a whole lifetime, I may be able to make adequatereturn."
"This resolution it is that will evolve the descent into the world of somany pleasure-bound spirits of retribution and the experience offantastic destinies; and this crimson pearl blade will also be among thenumber. The stone still lies in its original place, and why should notyou and I take it along before the tribunal of the Monitory VisionFairy, and place on its behalf its name on record, so that it shoulddescend into the world, in company with these spirits of passion, andbring this plot to an issue?"
"It is indeed ridiculous," interposed the Taoist. "Never before have Iheard even the very mention of restitution by means of tears! Why shouldnot you and I avail ourselves of this opportunity to likewise go downinto the world? and if successful in effecting the salvation of a few ofthem, will it not be a work meritorious and virtuous?"
"This proposal," remarked the Buddhist, "is quite in harmony with my ownviews. Come along then with me to the palace of the Monitory VisionFairy, and let us deliver up this good-for-nothing object, and have donewith it! And when the company of pleasure-bound spirits of wrath descendinto human existence, you and I can then enter the world. Half of themhave already fallen into the dusty universe, but the whole number ofthem have not, as yet, come together."
"Such being the case," the Taoist acquiesced, "I am ready to follow you,whenever you please to go."
But to return to Chen Shih-yin. Having heard every one of these wordsdistinctly, he could not refrain from forthwith stepping forward andpaying homage. "My spiritual lords," he said, as he smiled, "accept myobeisance." The Buddhist and Taoist priests lost no time in respondingto the compliment, and they exchanged the usual salutations. "Myspiritual lords," Shih-yin continued; "I have just heard theconversation that passed between you, on causes and effects, aconversation the like of which few mortals have forsooth listened to;but your younger brother is sluggish of intellect, and cannot lucidlyfathom the import! Yet could this dulness and simplicity be graciouslydispelled, your younger brother may, by listening minutely, withundefiled ear and careful attention, to a certain degree be aroused to asense of understanding; and what is more, possibly find the means ofescaping the anguish of sinking down into Hades."
The two spirits smiled, "The conversation," they added, "refers to theprimordial scheme and cannot be divulged before the proper season; but,when the time comes, mind do not forget us two, and you will readily beable to escape from the fiery furnace."
Shih-yin, after this reply, felt it difficult to make any furtherinquiries. "The primordial scheme," he however remarked smiling,"cannot, of course, be divulged; but what manner of thing, I wonder, isthe good-for-nothing object you alluded to a short while back? May I notbe allowed to judge for myself?"
"This object about which you ask," the Buddhist Bonze responded, "isintended, I may tell you, by fate to be just glanced at by you." Withthese words he produced it, and handed it over to Shih-yin.
Shih-yin received it. On scrutiny he found it, in fact, to be abeautiful gem, so lustrous and so clear that the traces of characters onthe surface were distinctly visible. The characters inscribed consistedof the four "T'ung Ling Pao Y�," "Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception."On the obverse, were also several columns of minute words, which he wasjust in the act of looking at intently, when the Buddhist at onceexpostulated.
"We have already reached," he exclaimed, "the confines of vision."Snatching it violently out of his hands, he walked away with the Taoist,under a lofty stone portal, on the face of which appeared in large typethe four characters: "T'ai Hs� Huan Ching," "The Visionary limits of theGreat Void." On each side was a scroll with the lines:
  When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false,  Where naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught.
Shih-yin meant also to follow them on the other side, but, as he wasabout to make one step forward, he suddenly heard a crash, just as ifthe mountains had fallen into ruins, and the earth sunk intodestruction. As Shih-yin uttered a loud shout, he looked with strainedeye; but all he could see was the fiery sun shining, with glowing rays,while the banana leaves drooped their heads. By that time, half of thecircumstances connected with the dream he had had, had already slippedfrom his memory.
He also noticed a nurse coming towards him with Ying Lien in her arms.To Shih-yin's eyes his daughter appeared even more beautiful, such abright gem, so precious, and so lovable. Forthwith stretching out hisarms, he took her over, and, as he held her in his embrace, he coaxedher to play with him for a while; after which he brought her up to thestreet to see the great stir occasioned by the procession that was goingpast.
He was about to come in, when he caught sight of two priests, one aTaoist, the other a Buddhist, coming hither from the opposite direction.The Buddhist had a head covered with mange, and went barefooted. TheTaoist had a limping foot, and his hair was all dishevelled.
Like maniacs, they jostled along, chattering and laughing as they drewnear.
As soon as they reached Shih-yin's door, and they perceived him withYing Lien in his arms, the Bonze began to weep aloud.
Turning towards Shih-yin, he said to him: "My good Sir, why need youcarry in your embrace this living but luckless thing, which will involvefather and mother in trouble?"
These words did not escape Shih-yin's ear; but persuaded that theyamounted to raving talk, he paid no heed whatever to the bonze.
"Part with her and give her to me," the Buddhist still went on to say.
Shih-yin could not restrain his annoyance; and hastily pressing hisdaughter closer to him, he was intent upon going in, when the bonzepointed his hand at him, and burst out in a loud fit of laughter.
He then gave utterance to the four lines that follow:
  You indulge your tender daughter and are laughed at as inane;  Vain you face the snow, oh mirror! for it will evanescent wane,  When the festival of lanterns is gone by, guard 'gainst your doom,  'Tis what time the flames will kindle, and the fire will consume.
Shih-yin understood distinctly the full import of what he heard; but hisheart was still full of conjectures. He was about to inquire who andwhat they were, when he heard the Taoist remark,--"You and I cannotspeed together; let us now part company, and each of us will be thenable to go after his own business. After the lapse of three ages, Ishall be at the Pei Mang mount, waiting for you; and we can, after ourreunion, betake ourselves to the Visionary Confines of the Great Void,there to cancel the name of the stone from the records."
"Excellent! first rate!" exclaimed the Bonze. And at the conclusion ofthese words, the two men parted, each going his own way, and no tracewas again seen of them.
"These two men," Shih-yin then pondered within his heart, "must have hadmany experiences, and I ought really to have made more inquiries ofthem; but at this juncture to indulge in regret is anyhow too late."
While Shih-yin gave way to these foolish reflections, he suddenlynoticed the arrival of a penniless scholar, Chia by surname, Hua byname, Shih-fei by style and Y�-ts'un by nickname, who had taken up hisquarters in the Gourd temple next door. This Chia Y�-ts'un wasoriginally a denizen of Hu-Chow, and was also of literary and officialparentage, but as he was born of the youngest stock, and the possessionsof his paternal and maternal ancestors were completely exhausted, andhis parents and relatives were dead, he remained the sole and onlysurvivor; and, as he found his residence in his native place of noavail, he therefore entered the capital in search of that reputation,which would enable him to put the family estate on a proper standing. Hehad arrived at this place since the year before last, and had, what ismore, lived all along in very straitened circumstances. He had made thetemple his temporary quarters, and earned a living by daily occupyinghimself in composing documents and writing letters for customers. Thusit was that Shih-yin had been in constant relations with him.
As soon as Y�-ts'un perceived Shih-yin, he lost no time in saluting him."My worthy Sir," he observed with a forced smile; "how is it you areleaning against the door and looking out? Is there perchance any newsastir in the streets, or in the public places?"
"None whatever," replied Shih-yin, as he returned the smile. "Just awhile back, my young daughter was in sobs, and I coaxed her out here toamuse her. I am just now without anything whatever to attend to, sothat, dear brother Chia, you come just in the nick of time. Please walkinto my mean abode, and let us endeavour, in each other's company, towhile away this long summer day."
After he had made this remark, he bade a servant take his daughter in,while he, hand-in-hand with Y�-ts'un, walked into the library, where ayoung page served tea. They had hardly exchanged a few sentences, whenone of the household came in, in flying haste, to announce that Mr. Yenhad come to pay a visit.
Shih-yin at once stood up. "Pray excuse my rudeness," he remarkedapologetically, "but do sit down; I shall shortly rejoin you, and enjoythe pleasure of your society." "My dear Sir," answered Y�-ts'un, as hegot up, also in a conceding way, "suit your own convenience. I've oftenhad the honour of being your guest, and what will it matter if I wait alittle?" While these apologies were yet being spoken, Shih-yin hadalready walked out into the front parlour. During his absence, Y�-ts'unoccupied himself in turning over the pages of some poetical work todispel ennui, when suddenly he heard, outside the window, a woman'scough. Y�-ts'un hurriedly got up and looked out. He saw at a glance thatit was a servant girl engaged in picking flowers. Her deportment was outof the common; her eyes so bright, her eyebrows so well defined. Thoughnot a perfect beauty, she possessed nevertheless charms sufficient toarouse the feelings. Y�-ts'un unwittingly gazed at her with fixed eye.This waiting-maid, belonging to the Chen family, had done pickingflowers, and was on the point of going in, when she of a sudden raisedher eyes and became aware of the presence of some person inside thewindow, whose head-gear consisted of a turban in tatters, while hisclothes were the worse for wear. But in spite of his poverty, he wasnaturally endowed with a round waist, a broad back, a fat face, a squaremouth; added to this, his eyebrows were swordlike, his eyes resembledstars, his nose was straight, his cheeks square.
This servant girl turned away in a hurry and made her escape.
"This man so burly and strong," she communed within herself, "yet at thesame time got up in such poor attire, must, I expect, be no one elsethan the man, whose name is Chia Y�-ts'un or such like, time after timereferred to by my master, and to whom he has repeatedly wished to give ahelping hand, but has failed to find a favourable opportunity. And asrelated to our family there is no connexion or friend in such straits, Ifeel certain it cannot be any other person than he. Strange to say, mymaster has further remarked that this man will, for a certainty, notalways continue in such a state of destitution."
As she indulged in this train of thought, she could not restrain herselffrom turning her head round once or twice.
When Y�-ts'un perceived that she had looked back, he readily interpretedit as a sign that in her heart her thoughts had been of him, and he wasfrantic with irrepressible joy.
"This girl," he mused, "is, no doubt, keen-eyed and eminently shrewd,and one in this world who has seen through me."
The servant youth, after a short time, came into the room; and whenY�-ts'un made inquiries and found out from him that the guests in thefront parlour had been detained to dinner, he could not very well waitany longer, and promptly walked away down a side passage and out of aback door.
When the guests had taken their leave, Shih-yin did not go back torejoin Y�-ts'un, as he had come to know that he had already left.
In time the mid-autumn festivities drew near; and Shih-yin, after thefamily banquet was over, had a separate table laid in the library, andcrossed over, in the moonlight, as far as the temple and invitedY�-ts'un to come round.
The fact is that Y�-ts'un, ever since the day on which he had seen thegirl of the Chen family turn twice round to glance at him, flatteredhimself that she was friendly disposed towards him, and incessantlyfostered fond thoughts of her in his heart. And on this day, whichhappened to be the mid-autumn feast, he could not, as he gazed at themoon, refrain from cherishing her remembrance. Hence it was that he gavevent to these pentameter verses:
  Alas! not yet divined my lifelong wish,  And anguish ceaseless comes upon anguish  I came, and sad at heart, my brow I frowned;  She went, and oft her head to look turned round.  Facing the breeze, her shadow she doth watch,  Who's meet this moonlight night with her to match?  The lustrous rays if they my wish but read  Would soon alight upon her beauteous head!
Y�-ts'un having, after this recitation, recalled again to mind how thatthroughout his lifetime his literary attainments had had an adverse fateand not met with an opportunity (of reaping distinction), went on to rubhis brow, and as he raised his eyes to the skies, he heaved a deep sighand once more intoned a couplet aloud:
  The gem in the cask a high price it seeks,  The pin in the case to take wing it waits.
As luck would have it, Shih-yin was at the moment approaching, and uponhearing the lines, he said with a smile: "My dear Y�-ts'un, really yourattainments are of no ordinary capacity."
Y�-ts'un lost no time in smiling and replying. "It would be presumptionin my part to think so," he observed. "I was simply at random humming afew verses composed by former writers, and what reason is there to laudme to such an excessive degree? To what, my dear Sir, do I owe thepleasure of your visit?" he went on to inquire. "Tonight," repliedShih-yin, "is the mid-autumn feast, generally known as the full-moonfestival; and as I could not help thinking that living, as you my worthybrother are, as a mere stranger in this Buddhist temple, you could notbut experience the feeling of loneliness. I have, for the expresspurpose, prepared a small entertainment, and will be pleased if you willcome to my mean abode to have a glass of wine. But I wonder whether youwill entertain favourably my modest invitation?" Y�-ts'un, afterlistening to the proposal, put forward no refusal of any sort; butremarked complacently: "Being the recipient of such marked attention,how can I presume to repel your generous consideration?"
As he gave expression to these words, he walked off there and then, incompany with Shih-yin, and came over once again into the court in frontof the library. In a few minutes, tea was over.
The cups and dishes had been laid from an early hour, and needless tosay the wines were luscious; the fare sumptuous.
The two friends took their seats. At first they leisurely replenishedtheir glasses, and quietly sipped their wine; but as, little by little,they entered into conversation, their good cheer grew more genial, andunawares the glasses began to fly round, and the cups to be exchanged.
At this very hour, in every house of the neighbourhood, sounded the fifeand lute, while the inmates indulged in music and singing. Above head,the orb of the radiant moon shone with an all-pervading splendour, andwith a steady lustrous light, while the two friends, as their exuberanceincreased, drained their cups dry so soon as they reached their lips.
Y�-ts'un, at this stage of the collation, was considerably under theinfluence of wine, and the vehemence of his high spirits wasirrepressible. As he gazed at the moon, he fostered thoughts, to whichhe gave vent by the recital of a double couplet.
  'Tis what time three meets five, Selene is a globe!  Her pure rays fill the court, the jadelike rails enrobe!  Lo! in the heavens her disk to view doth now arise,  And in the earth below to gaze men lift their eyes.
"Excellent!" cried Shih-yin with a loud voice, after he had heard theselines; "I have repeatedly maintained that it was impossible for you toremain long inferior to any, and now the verses you have recited are aprognostic of your rapid advancement. Already it is evident that, beforelong, you will extend your footsteps far above the clouds! I mustcongratulate you! I must congratulate you! Let me, with my own hands,pour a glass of wine to pay you my compliments."
Y�-ts'un drained the cup. "What I am about to say," he explained as hesuddenly heaved a sigh, "is not the maudlin talk of a man under theeffects of wine. As far as the subjects at present set in theexaminations go, I could, perchance, also have well been able to enterthe list, and to send in my name as a candidate; but I have, just now,no means whatever to make provision for luggage and for travellingexpenses. The distance too to Shen Ching is a long one, and I could notdepend upon the sale of papers or the composition of essays to find themeans of getting there."
Shih-yin gave him no time to conclude. "Why did you not speak about thissooner?" he interposed with haste. "I have long entertained thissuspicion; but as, whenever I met you, this conversation was neverbroached, I did not presume to make myself officious. But if such be thestate of affairs just now, I lack, I admit, literary qualification, buton the two subjects of friendly spirit and pecuniary means, I have,nevertheless, some experience. Moreover, I rejoice that next year isjust the season for the triennial examinations, and you should start forthe capital with all despatch; and in the tripos next spring, you will,by carrying the prize, be able to do justice to the proficiency you canboast of. As regards the travelling expenses and the other items, theprovision of everything necessary for you by my own self will again notrender nugatory your mean acquaintance with me."
Forthwith, he directed a servant lad to go and pack up at once fiftytaels of pure silver and two suits of winter clothes.
"The nineteenth," he continued, "is a propitious day, and you shouldlose no time in hiring a boat and starting on your journey westwards.And when, by your eminent talents, you shall have soared high to a loftyposition, and we meet again next winter, will not the occasion beextremely felicitous?"
Y�-ts'un accepted the money and clothes with but scanty expression ofgratitude. In fact, he paid no thought whatever to the gifts, but wenton, again drinking his wine, as he chattered and laughed.
It was only when the third watch of that day had already struck that thetwo friends parted company; and Shih-yin, after seeing Y�-ts'un off,retired to his room and slept, with one sleep all through, never wakinguntil the sun was well up in the skies.
Remembering the occurrence of the previous night, he meant to write acouple of letters of recommendation for Y�-ts'un to take along with himto the capital, to enable him, after handing them over at the mansionsof certain officials, to find some place as a temporary home. Heaccordingly despatched a servant to ask him to come round, but the manreturned and reported that from what the bonze said, "Mr. Chia hadstarted on his journey to the capital, at the fifth watch of that verymorning, that he had also left a message with the bonze to deliver toyou, Sir, to the effect that men of letters paid no heed to lucky orunlucky days, that the sole consideration with them was the nature ofthe matter in hand, and that he could find no time to come round inperson and bid good-bye."
Shih-yin after hearing this message had no alternative but to banish thesubject from his thoughts.
In comfortable circumstances, time indeed goes by with easy stride. Soondrew near also the happy festival of the 15th of the 1st moon, andShih-yin told a servant Huo Ch'i to take Ying Lien to see thesacrificial fires and flowery lanterns.
About the middle of the night, Huo Ch'i was hard pressed, and heforthwith set Ying Lien down on the doorstep of a certain house. When hefelt relieved, he came back to take her up, but failed to find anywhereany trace of Ying Lien. In a terrible plight, Huo Ch'i prosecuted hissearch throughout half the night; but even by the dawn of day, he hadnot discovered any clue of her whereabouts. Huo Ch'i, lacking, on theother hand, the courage to go back and face his master, promptly madehis escape to his native village.
Shih-yin--in fact, the husband as well as the wife--seeing that theirchild had not come home during the whole night, readily concluded thatsome mishap must have befallen her. Hastily they despatched severalservants to go in search of her, but one and all returned to report thatthere was neither vestige nor tidings of her.
This couple had only had this child, and this at the meridian of theirlife, so that her sudden disappearance plunged them in such greatdistress that day and night they mourned her loss to such a point as towell nigh pay no heed to their very lives.
A month in no time went by. Shih-yin was the first to fall ill, and hiswife, Dame Feng, likewise, by dint of fretting for her daughter, wasalso prostrated with sickness. The doctor was, day after day, sent for,and the oracle consulted by means of divination.
Little did any one think that on this day, being the 15th of the 3rdmoon, while the sacrificial oblations were being prepared in the Hu Lutemple, a pan with oil would have caught fire, through the want of careon the part of the bonze, and that in a short time the flames would haveconsumed the paper pasted on the windows.
Among the natives of this district bamboo fences and wooden partitionswere in general use, and these too proved a source of calamity soordained by fate (to consummate this decree).
With promptness (the fire) extended to two buildings, then envelopedthree, then dragged four (into ruin), and then spread to five houses,until the whole street was in a blaze, resembling the flames of avolcano. Though both the military and the people at once ran to therescue, the fire had already assumed a serious hold, so that it wasimpossible for them to afford any effective assistance for itssuppression.
It blazed away straight through the night, before it was extinguished,and consumed, there is in fact no saying how many dwelling houses.Anyhow, pitiful to relate, the Chen house, situated as it was next doorto the temple, was, at an early part of the evening, reduced to a heapof tiles and bricks; and nothing but the lives of that couple andseveral inmates of the family did not sustain any injuries.
Shih-yin was in despair, but all he could do was to stamp his feet andheave deep sighs. After consulting with his wife, they betook themselvesto a farm of theirs, where they took up their quarters temporarily. Butas it happened that water had of late years been scarce, and no cropsbeen reaped, robbers and thieves had sprung up like bees, and though theGovernment troops were bent upon their capture, it was anyhow difficultto settle down quietly on the farm. He therefore had no other resourcethan to convert, at a loss, the whole of his property into money, and totake his wife and two servant girls and come over for shelter to thehouse of his father-in-law.
His father-in-law, Feng Su, by name, was a native of Ta Ju Chou.Although only a labourer, he was nevertheless in easy circumstances athome. When he on this occasion saw his son-in-law come to him in suchdistress, he forthwith felt at heart considerable displeasure.Fortunately Shih-yin had still in his possession the money derived fromthe unprofitable realization of his property, so that he produced andhanded it to his father-in-law, commissioning him to purchase, whenevera suitable opportunity presented itself, a house and land as a provisionfor food and raiment against days to come. This Feng Su, however, onlyexpended the half of the sum, and pocketed the other half, merelyacquiring for him some fallow land and a dilapidated house.
Shih-yin being, on the other hand, a man of books and with no experiencein matters connected with business and with sowing and reaping,subsisted, by hook and by crook, for about a year or two, when he becamemore impoverished.
In his presence, Feng Su would readily give vent to specious utterances,while, with others, and behind his back, he on the contrary expressedhis indignation against his improvidence in his mode of living, andagainst his sole delight of eating and playing the lazy.
Shih-yin, aware of the want of harmony with his father-in-law, could nothelp giving way, in his own heart, to feelings of regret and pain. Inaddition to this, the fright and vexation which he had undergone theyear before, the anguish and suffering (he had had to endure), hadalready worked havoc (on his constitution); and being a man advanced inyears, and assailed by the joint attack of poverty and disease, he atlength gradually began to display symptoms of decline.
Strange coincidence, as he, on this day, came leaning on his staff andwith considerable strain, as far as the street for a little relaxation,he suddenly caught sight, approaching from the off side, of a Taoistpriest with a crippled foot; his maniac appearance so repulsive, hisshoes of straw, his dress all in tatters, muttering several sentimentsto this effect:
  All men spiritual life know to be good,  But fame to disregard they ne'er succeed!  From old till now the statesmen where are they?  Waste lie their graves, a heap of grass, extinct.  All men spiritual life know to be good,  But to forget gold, silver, ill succeed!  Through life they grudge their hoardings to be scant,  And when plenty has come, their eyelids close.  All men spiritual life hold to be good,  Yet to forget wives, maids, they ne'er succeed!  Who speak of grateful love while lives their lord,  And dead their lord, another they pursue.  All men spiritual life know to be good,  But sons and grandsons to forget never succeed!  From old till now of parents soft many,  But filial sons and grandsons who have seen?
Shih-yin upon hearing these words, hastily came up to the priest, "Whatwere you so glibly holding forth?" he inquired. "All I could hear were alot of hao liao (excellent, finality.")
"You may well have heard the two words 'hao liao,'" answered the Taoistwith a smile, "but can you be said to have fathomed their meaning? Youshould know that all things in this world are excellent, when they haveattained finality; when they have attained finality, they are excellent;but when they have not attained finality, they are not excellent; ifthey would be excellent, they should attain finality. My song isentitled Excellent-finality (hao liao)."
Shih-yin was gifted with a natural perspicacity that enabled him, assoon as he heard these remarks, to grasp their spirit.
"Wait a while," he therefore said smilingly; "let me unravel thisexcellent-finality song of yours; do you mind?"
"Please by all means go on with the interpretation," urged the Taoist;whereupon Shih-yin proceeded in this strain:
  Sordid rooms and vacant courts,  Replete in years gone by with beds where statesmen lay;  Parched grass and withered banian trees,  Where once were halls for song and dance!  Spiders' webs the carved pillars intertwine,  The green gauze now is also pasted on the straw windows!  What about the cosmetic fresh concocted or the powder just scented;  Why has the hair too on each temple become white like hoarfrost!  Yesterday the tumulus of yellow earth buried the bleached bones,  To-night under the red silk curtain reclines the couple!  Gold fills the coffers, silver fills the boxes,  But in a twinkle, the beggars will all abuse you!  While you deplore that the life of others is not long,  You forget that you yourself are approaching death!  You educate your sons with all propriety,  But they may some day, 'tis hard to say become thieves;  Though you choose (your fare and home) the fatted beam,  You may, who can say, fall into some place of easy virtue!  Through your dislike of the gauze hat as mean,  You have come to be locked in a cangue;  Yesterday, poor fellow, you felt cold in a tattered coat,  To-day, you despise the purple embroidered dress as long!  Confusion reigns far and wide! you have just sung your part, I come on      the boards,  Instead of yours, you recognise another as your native land;  What utter perversion!  In one word, it comes to this we make wedding clothes for others!  (We sow for others to reap.)
The crazy limping Taoist clapped his hands. "Your interpretation isexplicit," he remarked with a hearty laugh, "your interpretation isexplicit!"
Shih-yin promptly said nothing more than,--"Walk on;" and seizing thestole from the Taoist's shoulder, he flung it over his own. He did not,however, return home, but leisurely walked away, in company with theeccentric priest.
The report of his disappearance was at once bruited abroad, and plungedthe whole neighbourhood in commotion; and converted into a piece ofnews, it was circulated from mouth to mouth.
Dame Feng, Shih-yin's wife, upon hearing the tidings, had such a fit ofweeping that she hung between life and death; but her only alternativewas to consult with her father, and to despatch servants on all sides toinstitute inquiries. No news was however received of him, and she hadnothing else to do but to practise resignation, and to remain dependentupon the support of her parents for her subsistence. She had fortunatelystill by her side, to wait upon her, two servant girls, who had beenwith her in days gone by; and the three of them, mistress as well asservants, occupied themselves day and night with needlework, to assisther father in his daily expenses.
This Feng Su had after all, in spite of his daily murmurings against hisbad luck, no help but to submit to the inevitable.
On a certain day, the elder servant girl of the Chen family was at thedoor purchasing thread, and while there, she of a sudden heard in thestreet shouts of runners clearing the way, and every one explain thatthe new magistrate had come to take up his office.
The girl, as she peeped out from inside the door, perceived the lictorsand policemen go by two by two; and when unexpectedly in a state chair,was carried past an official, in black hat and red coat, she was indeedquite taken aback.
"The face of this officer would seem familiar," she argued withinherself; "just as if I had seen him somewhere or other ere this."
Shortly she entered the house, and banishing at once the occurrence fromher mind, she did not give it a second thought. At night, however, whileshe was waiting to go to bed, she suddenly heard a sound like a rap atthe door. A band of men boisterously cried out: "We are messengers,deputed by the worthy magistrate of this district, and come to summonone of you to an enquiry."
Feng Su, upon hearing these words, fell into such a terribleconsternation that his eyes stared wide and his mouth gaped.
What calamity was impending is not as yet ascertained, but, reader,listen to the explanation contained in the next chapter.

CHAPTER II.
  The spirit of Mrs. Chia Shih-yin departs from the town of Yang Chou.  Leng Tzu-hsing dilates upon the Jung Kuo Mansion.
To continue. Feng Su, upon hearing the shouts of the public messengers,came out in a flurry and forcing a smile, he asked them to explain(their errand); but all these people did was to continue bawling out:"Be quick, and ask Mr. Chen to come out."
"My surname is Feng," said Feng Su, as he promptly forced himself tosmile; "It is'nt Chen at all: I had once a son-in-law whose surname wasChen, but he has left home, it is now already a year or two back. Is itperchance about him that you are inquiring?"
To which the public servants remarked: "We know nothing about Chen orChia (true or false); but as he is your son-in-law, we'll take you atonce along with us to make verbal answer to our master and have donewith it."
And forthwith the whole bevy of public servants hustled Feng Su on, asthey went on their way back; while every one in the Feng family wasseized with consternation, and could not imagine what it was all about.
It was no earlier than the second watch, when Feng Su returned home; andthey, one and all, pressed him with questions as to what had happened.
"The fact is," he explained, "the newly-appointed Magistrate, whosesurname is Chia, whose name is Huo and who is a native of Hu-chow, hasbeen on intimate terms, in years gone by, with our son-in-law; that atthe sight of the girl Chiao Hsing, standing at the door, in the act ofbuying thread, he concluded that he must have shifted his quarters overhere, and hence it was that his messengers came to fetch him. I gave hima clear account of the various circumstances (of his misfortunes), andthe Magistrate was for a time much distressed and expressed his regret.He then went on to make inquiries about my grand-daughter, and Iexplained that she had been lost, while looking at the illuminations.'No matter,' put in the Magistrate, 'I will by and by order my men tomake search, and I feel certain that they will find her and bring herback.' Then ensued a short conversation, after which I was about to go,when he presented me with the sum of two taels."
The mistress of the Chen family (Mrs. Chen Shih-yin) could not but feelvery much affected by what she heard, and the whole evening she utterednot a word.
The next day, at an early hour, Y�-ts'un sent some of his men to bringover to Chen's wife presents, consisting of two packets of silver, andfour pieces of brocaded silk, as a token of gratitude, and to Feng Sualso a confidential letter, requesting him to ask of Mrs. Chen her maidChiao Hsing to become his second wife.
Feng Su was so intensely delighted that his eyebrows expanded, his eyessmiled, and he felt eager to toady to the Magistrate (by presenting thegirl to him). He hastened to employ all his persuasive powers with hisdaughter (to further his purpose), and on the same evening he forthwithescorted Chiao Hsing in a small chair to the Yam�n.
The joy experienced by Y�-ts'un need not be dilated upon. He alsopresented Feng Su with a packet containing one hundred ounces of gold;and sent numerous valuable presents to Mrs. Chen, enjoining her "to livecheerfully in the anticipation of finding out the whereabouts of herdaughter."
It must be explained, however, that the maid Chi'ao Hsing was the veryperson, who, a few years ago, had looked round at Y�-ts'un and who, byone simple, unpremeditated glance, evolved, in fact, this extraordinarydestiny which was indeed an event beyond conception.
Who would ever have foreseen that fate and fortune would both have sofavoured her that she should, contrary to all anticipation, give birthto a son, after living with Y�-ts'un barely a year, that in addition tothis, after the lapse of another half year, Y�-ts'un's wife should havecontracted a sudden illness and departed this life, and that Y�-ts'unshould have at once raised her to the rank of first wife. Her destiny isadequately expressed by the lines:
  Through but one single, casual look  Soon an exalted place she took.
The fact is that after Y�-ts'un had been presented with the money byShih-yin, he promptly started on the 16th day for the capital, and atthe triennial great tripos, his wishes were gratified to the full.Having successfully carried off his degree of graduate of the thirdrank, his name was put by selection on the list for provincialappointments. By this time, he had been raised to the rank of Magistratein this district; but, in spite of the excellence and sufficiency of hisaccomplishments and abilities, he could not escape being ambitious andoverbearing. He failed besides, confident as he was in his own merits,in respect toward his superiors, with the result that these officialslooked upon him scornfully with the corner of the eye.
A year had hardly elapsed, when he was readily denounced in a memorialto the Throne by the High Provincial authorities, who represented thathe was of a haughty disposition, that he had taken upon himself tointroduce innovations in the rites and ceremonies, that overtly, whilehe endeavoured to enjoy the reputation of probity and uprightness, he,secretly, combined the nature of the tiger and wolf; with theconsequence that he had been the cause of much trouble in the district,and that he had made life intolerable for the people, &c. &c.
The Dragon countenance of the Emperor was considerably incensed. HisMajesty lost no time in issuing commands, in reply to the Memorial, thathe should be deprived of his official status.
On the arrival of the despatch from the Board, great was the joy felt byevery officer, without exception, of the prefecture in which he had heldoffice. Y�-ts'un, though at heart intensely mortified and incensed,betrayed not the least outward symptom of annoyance, but stillpreserved, as of old, a smiling and cheerful countenance.
He handed over charge of all official business and removed the savingswhich he had accumulated during the several years he had been in office,his family and all his chattels to his original home; where, afterhaving put everything in proper order, he himself travelled (carried thewinds and sleeved the moon) far and wide, visiting every relic of notein the whole Empire.
As luck would have it, on a certain day while making a second journeythrough the Wei Yang district, he heard the news that the SaltCommissioner appointed this year was Lin Ju-hai. This Lin Ju-hai'sfamily name was Lin, his name Hai and his style Ju-hai. He had obtainedthe third place in the previous triennial examination, and had, by thistime, already risen to the rank of Director of the Court of Censors. Hewas a native of K� Su. He had been recently named by Imperialappointment a Censor attached to the Salt Inspectorate, and had arrivedat his post only a short while back.
In fact, the ancestors of Lin Ju-hai had, from years back, successivelyinherited the title of Marquis, which rank, by its present descent toJu-hai, had already been enjoyed by five generations. When firstconferred, the hereditary right to the title had been limited to threegenerations; but of late years, by an act of magnanimous favour andgenerous beneficence, extraordinary bounty had been superadded; and onthe arrival of the succession to the father of Ju-hai, the right hadbeen extended to another degree. It had now descended to Ju-hai, whohad, besides this title of nobility, begun his career as a successfulgraduate. But though his family had been through uninterrupted ages therecipient of imperial bounties, his kindred had all been anyhow men ofculture.
The only misfortune had been that the several branches of the Lin familyhad not been prolific, so that the numbers of its members continuedlimited; and though there existed several households, they were allhowever to Ju-hai no closer relatives than first cousins. Neither werethere any connections of the same lineage, or of the same parentage.
Ju-hai was at this date past forty; and had only had a son, who had diedthe previous year, in the third year of his age. Though he had severalhandmaids, he had not had the good fortune of having another son; butthis was too a matter that could not be remedied.
By his wife, n�e Chia, he had a daughter, to whom the infant name of TaiY� was given. She was, at this time, in her fifth year. Upon her theparents doated as much as if she were a brilliant pearl in the palm oftheir hand. Seeing that she was endowed with natural gifts ofintelligence and good looks, they also felt solicitous to bestow uponher a certain knowledge of books, with no other purpose than that ofsatisfying, by this illusory way, their wishes of having a son tonurture and of dispelling the anguish felt by them, on account of thedesolation and void in their family circle (round their knees).
But to proceed. Y�-ts'un, while sojourning at an inn, was unexpectedlylaid up with a violent chill. Finding on his recovery, that his fundswere not sufficient to pay his expenses, he was thinking of looking outfor some house where he could find a resting place when he suddenly cameacross two friends acquainted with the new Salt Commissioner. Knowingthat this official was desirous to find a tutor to instruct hisdaughter, they lost no time in recommending Y�-ts'un, who moved into theYam�n.
His female pupil was youthful in years and delicate in physique, so thather lessons were irregular. Besides herself, there were only two waitinggirls, who remained in attendance during the hours of study, so thatY�-ts'un was spared considerable trouble and had a suitable opportunityto attend to the improvement of his health.
In a twinkle, another year and more slipped by, and when least expected,the mother of his ward, n�e Chia, was carried away after a shortillness. His pupil (during her mother's sickness) was dutiful in herattendance, and prepared the medicines for her use. (And after herdeath,) she went into the deepest mourning prescribed by the rites, andgave way to such excess of grief that, naturally delicate as she was,her old complaint, on this account, broke out anew.
Being unable for a considerable time to prosecute her studies, Y�-ts'unlived at leisure and had no duties to attend to. Whenever therefore thewind was genial and the sun mild, he was wont to stroll at random, afterhe had done with his meals.
On this particular day, he, by some accident, extended his walk beyondthe suburbs, and desirous to contemplate the nature of the rusticscenery, he, with listless step, came up to a spot encircled by hillsand streaming pools, by luxuriant clumps of trees and thick groves ofbamboos. Nestling in the dense foliage stood a temple. The doors andcourts were in ruins. The walls, inner and outer, in disrepair. Aninscription on a tablet testified that this was the temple of SpiritualPerception. On the sides of the door was also a pair of old anddilapidated scrolls with the following enigmatical verses.
  Behind ample there is, yet to retract the hand, the mind heeds not,      until.  Before the mortal vision lies no path, when comes to turn the will.
"These two sentences," Y�-ts'un pondered after perusal, "although simplein language, are profound in signification. I have previous to thisvisited many a spacious temple, located on hills of note, but never haveI beheld an inscription referring to anything of the kind. The meaningcontained in these words must, I feel certain, owe their origin to theexperiences of some person or other; but there's no saying. But whyshould I not go in and inquire for myself?"
Upon walking in, he at a glance caught sight of no one else, but of avery aged bonze, of unkempt appearance, cooking his rice. When Y�-ts'unperceived that he paid no notice, he went up to him and asked him one ortwo questions, but as the old priest was dull of hearing and a dotard,and as he had lost his teeth, and his tongue was blunt, he made mostirrelevant replies.
Y�-ts'un lost all patience with him, and withdrew again from thecompound with the intention of going as far as the village public houseto have a drink or two, so as to enhance the enjoyment of the rusticscenery. With easy stride, he accordingly walked up to the place.Scarcely had he passed the threshold of the public house, when heperceived some one or other among the visitors who had been sittingsipping their wine on the divan, jump up and come up to greet him, witha face beaming with laughter.
"What a strange meeting! What a strange meeting!" he exclaimed aloud.
Y�-ts'un speedily looked at him, (and remembered) that this person had,in past days, carried on business in a curio establishment in thecapital, and that his surname was Leng and his style Tzu-hsing.
A mutual friendship had existed between them during their sojourn, indays of yore, in the capital; and as Y�-ts'un had entertained thehighest opinion of Leng Tzu-hsing, as being a man of action and of greatabilities, while this Leng Tzu-hsing, on the other hand, borrowed of thereputation of refinement enjoyed by Y�-ts'un, the two had consequentlyall along lived in perfect harmony and companionship.
"When did you get here?" Y�-ts'un eagerly inquired also smilingly. "Iwasn't in the least aware of your arrival. This unexpected meeting ispositively a strange piece of good fortune."
"I went home," Tzu-hsing replied, "about the close of last year, but nowas I am again bound to the capital, I passed through here on my way tolook up a friend of mine and talk some matters over. He had the kindnessto press me to stay with him for a couple of days longer, and as I afterall have no urgent business to attend to, I am tarrying a few days, butpurpose starting about the middle of the moon. My friend is busy to-day,so I roamed listlessly as far as here, never dreaming of such afortunate meeting."
While speaking, he made Y�-ts'un sit down at the same table, and ordereda fresh supply of wine and eatables; and as the two friends chatted ofone thing and another, they slowly sipped their wine.
The conversation ran on what had occurred after the separation, andY�-ts'un inquired, "Is there any news of any kind in the capital?"
"There's nothing new whatever," answered Tzu-hsing. "There is one thinghowever: in the family of one of your worthy kinsmen, of the same nameas yourself, a trifling, but yet remarkable, occurrence has takenplace."
"None of my kindred reside in the capital," rejoined Y�-ts'un with asmile. "To what can you be alluding?"
"How can it be that you people who have the same surname do not belongto one clan?" remarked Tzu-hsing, sarcastically.
"In whose family?" inquired Y�-ts'un.
"The Chia family," replied Tzu-hsing smiling, "whose quarters are in theJung Kuo Mansion, does not after all reflect discredit upon the lintelof your door, my venerable friend."
"What!" exclaimed Y�-ts'un, "did this affair take place in that family?Were we to begin reckoning, we would find the members of my clan to beanything but limited in number. Since the time of our ancestor Chia Fu,who lived while the Eastern Han dynasty occupied the Throne, thebranches of our family have been numerous and flourishing; they are nowto be found in every single province, and who could, with any accuracy,ascertain their whereabouts? As regards the Jung-kuo branch inparticular, their names are in fact inscribed on the same register asour own, but rich and exalted as they are, we have never presumed toclaim them as our relatives, so that we have become more and moreestranged."
"Don't make any such assertions," Tzu-hsing remarked with a sigh, "thepresent two mansions of Jung and Ning have both alike also sufferedreverses, and they cannot come up to their state of days of yore."
"Up to this day, these two households of Ning and of Jung," Y�-ts'unsuggested, "still maintain a very large retinue of people, and how canit be that they have met with reverses?"
"To explain this would be indeed a long story," said Leng Tzu-hsing."Last year," continued Y�-ts'un, "I arrived at Chin Ling, as Ientertained a wish to visit the remains of interest of the sixdynasties, and as I on that day entered the walled town of Shih T'ou, Ipassed by the entrance of that old residence. On the east side of thestreet, stood the Ning Kuo mansion; on the west the Jung Kuo mansion;and these two, adjoining each other as they do, cover in fact well-nighhalf of the whole length of the street. Outside the front gateeverything was, it is true, lonely and deserted; but at a glance intothe interior over the enclosing wall, I perceived that the halls,pavilions, two-storied structures and porches presented still a majesticand lofty appearance. Even the flower garden, which extends over thewhole area of the back grounds, with its trees and rockeries, alsopossessed to that day an air of luxuriance and freshness, which betrayedno signs of a ruined or decrepid establishment."
"You have had the good fortune of starting in life as a graduate,"explained Tzu-tsing as he smiled, "and yet are not aware of the sayinguttered by some one of old: that a centipede even when dead does not liestiff. (These families) may, according to your version, not be up to theprosperity of former years, but, compared with the family of an ordinaryofficial, their condition anyhow presents a difference. Of late thenumber of the inmates has, day by day, been on the increase; theiraffairs have become daily more numerous; of masters and servants, highand low, who live in ease and respectability very many there are; but ofthose who exercise any forethought, or make any provision, there is noteven one. In their daily wants, their extravagances, and theirexpenditure, they are also unable to adapt themselves to circumstancesand practise economy; (so that though) the present external frameworkmay not have suffered any considerable collapse, their purses haveanyhow begun to feel an exhausting process! But this is a mere trifle.There is another more serious matter. Would any one ever believe that insuch families of official status, in a clan of education and culture,the sons and grandsons of the present age would after all be each(succeeding) generation below the standard of the former?"
Y�-ts'un, having listened to these remarks, observed: "How ever can itbe possible that families of such education and refinement can observeany system of training and nurture which is not excellent? Concerningthe other branches, I am not in a position to say anything; butrestricting myself to the two mansions of Jung and Ning, they are thosein which, above all others, the education of their children ismethodical."
"I was just now alluding to none other than these two establishments,"Tzu-hsing observed with a sigh; "but let me tell you all. In days ofyore, the duke of Ning Kuo and the duke of Jung Kuo were two uterinebrothers. The Ning duke was the elder; he had four sons. After the deathof the duke of Ning Kuo, his eldest son, Chia Tai-hua, came into thetitle. He also had two sons; but the eldest, whose name was Hu, died atthe age of eight or nine; and the only survivor, the second son, ChiaChing, inherited the title. His whole mind is at this time set uponTaoist doctrines; his sole delight is to burn the pill and refine thedual powers; while every other thought finds no place in his mind.Happily, he had, at an early age, left a son, Chia Chen, behind in thelay world, and his father, engrossed as his whole heart was with theidea of attaining spiritual life, ceded the succession of the officialtitle to him. His parent is, besides, not willing to return to theoriginal family seat, but lives outside the walls of the capital,foolishly hobnobbing with all the Taoist priests. This Mr. Chen had alsoa son, Chia Jung, who is, at this period, just in his sixteenth year.Mr. Ching gives at present no attention to anything at all, so that Mr.Chen naturally devotes no time to his studies, but being bent uponnought else but incessant high pleasure, he has subversed the order ofthings in the Ning Kuo mansion, and yet no one can summon the courage tocome and hold him in check. But I'll now tell you about the Jung mansionfor your edification. The strange occurrence, to which I alluded justnow, came about in this manner. After the demise of the Jung duke, theeldest son, Chia Tai-shan, inherited the rank. He took to himself aswife, the daughter of Marquis Shih, a noble family of Chin Ling, by whomhe had two sons; the elder being Chia She, the younger Chia Cheng. ThisTai Shan is now dead long ago; but his wife is still alive, and theelder son, Chia She, succeeded to the degree. He is a man of amiable andgenial disposition, but he likewise gives no thought to the direction ofany domestic concern. The second son Chia Cheng displayed, from hisearly childhood, a great liking for books, and grew up to be correct andupright in character. His grandfather doated upon him, and would havehad him start in life through the arena of public examinations, but,when least expected, Tai-shan, being on the point of death, bequeathed apetition, which was laid before the Emperor. His Majesty, out of regardfor his former minister, issued immediate commands that the elder sonshould inherit the estate, and further inquired how many sons there werebesides him, all of whom he at once expressed a wish to be introduced inhis imperial presence. His Majesty, moreover, displayed exceptionalfavour, and conferred upon Mr. Cheng the brevet rank of second classAssistant Secretary (of a Board), and commanded him to enter the Boardto acquire the necessary experience. He has already now been promoted tothe office of second class Secretary. This Mr. Cheng's wife, n�e Wang,first gave birth to a son called Chia Chu, who became a Licentiate inhis fourteenth year. At barely twenty, he married, but fell ill and diedsoon after the birth of a son. Her (Mrs. Cheng's) second child was adaughter, who came into the world, by a strange coincidence, on thefirst day of the year. She had an unexpected (pleasure) in the birth,the succeeding year, of another son, who, still more remarkable to say,had, at the time of his birth, a piece of variegated and crystal-likebrilliant jade in his mouth, on which were yet visible the outlines ofseveral characters. Now, tell me, was not this a novel and strangeoccurrence? eh?"
"Strange indeed!" exclaimed Y�-ts'un with a smile; "but I presume thecoming experiences of this being will not be mean."
Tzu-hsing gave a faint smile. "One and all," he remarked, "entertain thesame idea. Hence it is that his mother doats upon him like upon aprecious jewel. On the day of his first birthday, Mr. Cheng readilyentertained a wish to put the bent of his inclinations to the test, andplaced before the child all kinds of things, without number, for him tograsp from. Contrary to every expectation, he scorned every otherobject, and, stretching forth his hand, he simply took hold of rouge,powder and a few hair-pins, with which he began to play. Mr. Chengexperienced at once displeasure, as he maintained that this youth would,by and bye, grow up into a sybarite, devoted to wine and women, and forthis reason it is, that he soon began to feel not much attachment forhim. But his grandmother is the one who, in spite of everything, prizeshim like the breath of her own life. The very mention of what happenedis even strange! He is now grown up to be seven or eight years old, and,although exceptionally wilful, in intelligence and precocity, however,not one in a hundred could come up to him! And as for the utterances ofthis child, they are no less remarkable. The bones and flesh of woman,he argues, are made of water, while those of man of mud. 'Women to myeyes are pure and pleasing,' he says, 'while at the sight of man, Ireadily feel how corrupt, foul and repelling they are!' Now tell me, arenot these words ridiculous? There can be no doubt whatever that he willby and bye turn out to be a licentious rou�."
Y�-ts'un, whose countenance suddenly assumed a stern air, promptlyinterrupted the conversation. "It doesn't quite follow," he suggested."You people don't, I regret to say, understand the destiny of thischild. The fact is that even the old Hanlin scholar Mr. Cheng waserroneously looked upon as a loose rake and dissolute debauchee! Butunless a person, through much study of books and knowledge of letters,so increases (in lore) as to attain the talent of discerning the natureof things, and the vigour of mind to fathom the Taoist reason as well asto comprehend the first principle, he is not in a position to form anyjudgment."
Tzu-hsing upon perceiving the weighty import of what he propounded,"Please explain," he asked hastily, "the drift (of your argument)." Towhich Y�-ts'un responded: "Of the human beings created by the operationof heaven and earth, if we exclude those who are gifted with extremebenevolence and extreme viciousness, the rest, for the most part,present no striking diversity. If they be extremely benevolent, theyfall in, at the time of their birth, with an era of propitious fortune;while those extremely vicious correspond, at the time of theirexistence, with an era of calamity. When those who coexist withpropitious fortune come into life, the world is in order; when those whocoexist with unpropitious fortune come into life, the world is indanger. Yao, Shun, Y�, Ch'eng T'ang, Wen Wang, Wu Wang, Chou Kung, ChaoKung, Confucius, Mencius, T'ung Hu, Han Hsin, Chou Tzu, Ch'eng Tzu, ChuTzu and Chang Tzu were ordained to see light in an auspicious era.Whereas Ch'i Yu, Kung Kung, Chieh Wang, Chou Wang, Shih Huang, WangMang, Tsao Ts'ao, Wen Wen, An Hu-shan, Ch'in Kuei and others were oneand all destined to come into the world during a calamitous age. Thoseendowed with extreme benevolence set the world in order; those possessedof extreme maliciousness turn the world into disorder. Purity,intelligence, spirituality and subtlety constitute the vital spirit ofright which pervades heaven and earth, and the persons gifted withbenevolence are its natural fruit. Malignity and perversity constitutethe spirit of evil, which permeates heaven and earth, and maliciouspersons are affected by its influence. The days of perpetual happinessand eminent good fortune, and the era of perfect peace and tranquility,which now prevail, are the offspring of the pure, intelligent, divineand subtle spirit which ascends above, to the very Emperor, and belowreaches the rustic and uncultured classes. Every one is withoutexception under its influence. The superfluity of the subtle spiritexpands far and wide, and finding nowhere to betake itself to, becomes,in due course, transformed into dew, or gentle breeze; and, by a processof diffusion, it pervades the whole world.
"The spirit of malignity and perversity, unable to expand under thebrilliant sky and transmuting sun, eventually coagulates, pervades andstops up the deep gutters and extensive caverns; and when of a suddenthe wind agitates it or it be impelled by the clouds, and any slightdisposition, on its part, supervenes to set itself in motion, or tobreak its bounds, and so little as even the minutest fraction doesunexpectedly find an outlet, and happens to come across any spirit ofperception and subtlety which may be at the time passing by, the spiritof right does not yield to the spirit of evil, and the spirit of evil isagain envious of the spirit of right, so that the two do not harmonize.Just like wind, water, thunder and lightning, which, when they meet inthe bowels of the earth, must necessarily, as they are both to dissolveand are likewise unable to yield, clash and explode to the end that theymay at length exhaust themselves. Hence it is that these spirits havealso forcibly to diffuse themselves into the human race to find anoutlet, so that they may then completely disperse, with the result thatmen and women are suddenly imbued with these spirits and spring intoexistence. At best, (these human beings) cannot be generated intophilanthropists or perfect men; at worst, they cannot also embodyextreme perversity or extreme wickedness. Yet placed among one millionbeings, the spirit of intelligence, refinement, perception and subtletywill be above these one million beings; while, on the other hand, theperverse, depraved and inhuman embodiment will likewise be below themillion of men. Born in a noble and wealthy family, these men will be asalacious, lustful lot; born of literary, virtuous or poor parentage,they will turn out retired scholars or men of mark; though they may bysome accident be born in a destitute and poverty-stricken home, theycannot possibly, in fact, ever sink so low as to become runners ormenials, or contentedly brook to be of the common herd or to be drivenand curbed like a horse in harness. They will become, for a certainty,either actors of note or courtesans of notoriety; as instanced in formeryears by Hs� Yu, T'ao Ch'ien, Yuan Chi, Chi Kang, Liu Ling, the twofamilies of Wang and Hsieh, Ku Hu-t'ou, Ch'en Hou-chu, T'ang Ming-huang,Sung Hui-tsung, Liu T'ing-chih, Wen Fei-ching, Mei Nan-kung, ShihMan-ch'ing, Lui C'hih-ch'ing and Chin Shao-yu, and exemplifiednow-a-days by Ni Y�n-lin, T'ang Po-hu, Chu Chih-shan, and also by LiKuei-men, Huang P'an-cho, Ching Hsin-mo, Cho Wen-ch�n; and the womenHung Fu, Hsieh T'ao, Ch'� Ying, Ch'ao Y�n and others; all of whom wereand are of the same stamp, though placed in different scenes of action."
"From what you say," observed Tzu-hsing, "success makes (a man) a dukeor a marquis; ruin, a thief!"
"Quite so; that's just my idea!" replied Y�-ts'un; "I've not as yet letyou know that after my degradation from office, I spent the last coupleof years in travelling for pleasure all over each province, and that Ialso myself came across two extraordinary youths. This is why, when ashort while back you alluded to this Pao-y�, I at once conjectured, witha good deal of certainty, that he must be a human being of the samestamp. There's no need for me to speak of any farther than the walledcity of Chin Ling. This Mr. Chen was, by imperial appointment, namedPrincipal of the Government Public College of the Chin Ling province. Doyou perhaps know him?"
"Who doesn't know him?" remarked Tzu-hsing. "This Chen family is an oldconnection of the Chia family. These two families were on terms of greatintimacy, and I myself likewise enjoyed the pleasure of their friendshipfor many a day."
"Last year, when at Chin Ling," Y�-ts'un continued with a smile, "someone recommended me as resident tutor to the school in the Chen mansion;and when I moved into it I saw for myself the state of things. Who wouldever think that that household was grand and luxurious to such a degree!But they are an affluent family, and withal full of propriety, so that aschool like this was of course not one easy to obtain. The pupil,however, was, it is true, a young tyro, but far more troublesome toteach than a candidate for the examination of graduate of the seconddegree. Were I to enter into details, you would indeed have a laugh. 'Imust needs,' he explained, 'have the company of two girls in my studiesto enable me to read at all, and to keep likewise my brain clear.Otherwise, if left to myself, my head gets all in a muddle.' Time aftertime, he further expounded to his young attendants, how extremelyhonourable and extremely pure were the two words representing woman,that they are more valuable and precious than the auspicious animal, thefelicitous bird, rare flowers and uncommon plants. 'You may not' (he waswont to say), 'on any account heedlessly utter them, you set of foulmouths and filthy tongues! these two words are of the utmost import!Whenever you have occasion to allude to them, you must, before you cando so with impunity, take pure water and scented tea and rinse yourmouths. In the event of any slip of the tongue, I shall at once haveyour teeth extracted, and your eyes gouged out.' His obstinacy andwaywardness are, in every respect, out of the common. After he wasallowed to leave school, and to return home, he became, at the sight ofthe young ladies, so tractable, gentle, sharp, and polite, transformed,in fact, like one of them. And though, for this reason, his father haspunished him on more than one occasion, by giving him a sound thrashing,such as brought him to the verge of death, he cannot however change.Whenever he was being beaten, and could no more endure the pain, he waswont to promptly break forth in promiscuous loud shouts, 'Girls! girls!'The young ladies, who heard him from the inner chambers, subsequentlymade fun of him. 'Why,' they said, 'when you are being thrashed, and youare in pain, your only thought is to bawl out girls! Is it perchancethat you expect us young ladies to go and intercede for you? How is thatyou have no sense of shame?' To their taunts he gave a most plausibleexplanation. 'Once,' he replied, 'when in the agony of pain, I gave ventto shouting girls, in the hope, perchance, I did not then know, of itsbeing able to alleviate the soreness. After I had, with this purpose,given one cry, I really felt the pain considerably better; and now thatI have obtained this secret spell, I have recourse, at once, when I amin the height of anguish, to shouts of girls, one shout after another.Now what do you say to this? Isn't this absurd, eh?"
"The grandmother is so infatuated by her extreme tenderness for thisyouth, that, time after time, she has, on her grandson's account, foundfault with the tutor, and called her son to task, with the result that Iresigned my post and took my leave. A youth, with a disposition such ashis, cannot assuredly either perpetuate intact the estate of his fatherand grandfather, or follow the injunctions of teacher or advice offriends. The pity is, however, that there are, in that family, severalexcellent female cousins, the like of all of whom it would be difficultto discover."
"Quite so!" remarked Tzu-hsing; "there are now three young ladies in theChia family who are simply perfection itself. The eldest is a daughterof Mr. Cheng, Yuan Ch'un by name, who, on account of her excellence,filial piety, talents, and virtue, has been selected as a governess inthe palace. The second is the daughter of Mr. She's handmaid, and iscalled Ying Ch'un; the third is T'an Ch'un, the child of Mr. Cheng'shandmaid; while the fourth is the uterine sister of Mr. Chen of the NingMansion. Her name is Hsi Ch'un. As dowager lady Shih is so fondlyattached to her granddaughters, they come, for the most part, over totheir grandmother's place to prosecute their studies together, and eachone of these girls is, I hear, without a fault."
"More admirable," observed Y�-ts'un, "is the r�gime (adhered to) in theChen family, where the names of the female children have all beenselected from the list of male names, and are unlike all thoseout-of-the-way names, such as Spring Blossom, Scented Gem, and the likeflowery terms in vogue in other families. But how is it that the Chiafamily have likewise fallen into this common practice?"
"Not so!" ventured Tzu-h'sing. "It is simply because the eldest daughterwas born on the first of the first moon, that the name of Yuan Ch'un wasgiven to her; while with the rest this character Ch'un (spring) was thenfollowed. The names of the senior generation are, in like manner,adopted from those of their brothers; and there is at present aninstance in support of this. The wife of your present worthy master, Mr.Lin, is the uterine sister of Mr. Chia. She and Mr. Chia Cheng, and shewent, while at home, under the name of Chia Min. Should you question thetruth of what I say, you are at liberty, on your return, to make minuteinquiries and you'll be convinced."
Y�-ts'un clapped his hands and said smiling, "It's so, I know! for thisfemale pupil of mine, whose name is Tai-y�, invariably pronounces thecharacter _min_ as _mi_, whenever she comes across it in thecourse of her reading; while, in writing, when she comes to thecharacter 'min,' she likewise reduces the strokes by one, sometimes bytwo. Often have I speculated in my mind (as to the cause), but theremarks I've heard you mention, convince me, without doubt, that it isno other reason (than that of reverence to her mother's name). Strangeenough, this pupil of mine is unique in her speech and deportment, andin no way like any ordinary young lady. But considering that her motherwas no commonplace woman herself, it is natural that she should havegiven birth to such a child. Besides, knowing, as I do now, that she isthe granddaughter of the Jung family, it is no matter of surprise to methat she is what she is. Poor girl, her mother, after all, died in thecourse of the last month."
Tzu-hsing heaved a sigh. "Of three elderly sisters," he explained, "thisone was the youngest, and she too is gone! Of the sisters of the seniorgeneration not one even survives! But now we'll see what the husbands ofthis younger generation will be like by and bye!"
"Yes," replied Y�-ts'un. "But some while back you mentioned that Mr.Cheng has had a son, born with a piece of jade in his mouth, and that hehas besides a tender-aged grandson left by his eldest son; but is itlikely that this Mr. She has not, himself, as yet, had any male issue?"
"After Mr. Cheng had this son with the jade," Tzu-hsing added, "hishandmaid gave birth to another son, who whether he be good or bad, Idon't at all know. At all events, he has by his side two sons and agrandson, but what these will grow up to be by and bye, I cannot tell.As regards Mr. Chia She, he too has had two sons; the second of whom,Chia Lien, is by this time about twenty. He took to wife a relative ofhis, a niece of Mr. Cheng's wife, a Miss Wang, and has now been marriedfor the last two years. This Mr. Lien has lately obtained by purchasethe rank of sub-prefect. He too takes little pleasure in books, but asfar as worldly affairs go, he is so versatile and glib of tongue, thathe has recently taken up his quarters with his uncle Mr. Cheng, to whomhe gives a helping hand in the management of domestic matters. Who wouldhave thought it, however, ever since his marriage with his worthy wife,not a single person, whether high or low, has there been who has notlooked up to her with regard: with the result that Mr. Lien himself has,in fact, had to take a back seat (_lit_. withdrew 35 li). In looks,she is also so extremely beautiful, in speech so extremely quick andfluent, in ingenuity so deep and astute, that even a man could, in noway, come up to her mark."
After hearing these remarks Y�-ts'un smiled. "You now perceive," hesaid, "that my argument is no fallacy, and that the several personsabout whom you and I have just been talking are, we may presume, humanbeings, who, one and all, have been generated by the spirit of right,and the spirit of evil, and come to life by the same royal road; but ofcourse there's no saying."
"Enough," cried Tzu-hsing, "of right and enough of evil; we've beendoing nothing but settling other people's accounts; come now, haveanother glass, and you'll be the better for it!"
"While bent upon talking," Y�-ts'un explained, "I've had more glassesthan is good for me."
"Speaking of irrelevant matters about other people," Tzu-hsing rejoinedcomplacently, "is quite the thing to help us swallow our wine; so comenow; what harm will happen, if we do have a few glasses more."
Y�-ts'un thereupon looked out of the window.
"The day is also far advanced," he remarked, "and if we don't take care,the gates will be closing; let us leisurely enter the city, and as we goalong, there will be nothing to prevent us from continuing our chat."
Forthwith the two friends rose from their seats, settled and paid theirwine bill, and were just going, when they unexpectedly heard some onefrom behind say with a loud voice:
"Accept my congratulations, Brother Y�-ts'un; I've now come, with theexpress purpose of giving you the welcome news!"
Y�-ts'un lost no time in turning his head round to look at the speaker.But reader, if you wish to learn who the man was, listen to the detailsgiven in the following chapter.

CHAPTER III.
  Lin Ju-hai appeals to his brother-in-law, Chia Cheng, recommending      Y�-ts'un, his daughter's tutor, to his consideration.  Dowager lady Chia sends to fetch her granddaughter, out of      commiseration for her being a motherless child.
But to proceed with our narrative.
Y�-ts'un, on speedily turning round, perceived that the speaker was noother than a certain Chang Ju-kuei, an old colleague of his, who hadbeen denounced and deprived of office, on account of some case or other;a native of that district, who had, since his degradation, resided inhis family home.
Having lately come to hear the news that a memorial, presented in thecapital, that the former officers (who had been cashiered) should bereinstated, had received the imperial consent, he had promptly done allhe could, in every nook and corner, to obtain influence, and to find themeans (of righting his position,) when he, unexpectedly, came acrossY�-ts'un, to whom he therefore lost no time in offering hiscongratulations. The two friends exchanged the conventional salutations,and Chang Ju-kuei forthwith communicated the tidings to Y�-ts'un.
Y�-ts'un was delighted, but after he had made a few remarks, in a greathurry, each took his leave and sped on his own way homewards.
Leng Tzu-hsing, upon hearing this conversation, hastened at once topropose a plan, advising Y�-ts'un to request Lin Ju-hai, in his turn, toappeal in the capital to Mr. Chia Cheng for support.
Y�-ts'un accepted the suggestion, and parted from his companion.
On his return to his quarters, he made all haste to lay his hand on theMetropolitan Gazette, and having ascertained that the news wasauthentic, he had on the next day a personal consultation with Ju-hai.
"Providence and good fortune are both alike propitious!" exclaimedJu-hai. "After the death of my wife, my mother-in-law, whose residenceis in the capital, was so very solicitous on my daughter's account, forhaving no one to depend upon, that she despatched, at an early period,boats with men and women servants to come and fetch her. But my childwas at the time not quite over her illness, and that is why she has notyet started. I was, this very moment, cogitating to send my daughter tothe capital. And in view of the obligation, under which I am to you forthe instruction you have heretofore conferred upon her, remaining as yetunrequited, there is no reason why, when such an opportunity as thispresents itself, I should not do my utmost to find means to make properacknowledgment. I have already, in anticipation, given the matter myattention, and written a letter of recommendation to my brother-in-law,urging him to put everything right for you, in order that I may, to acertain extent, be able to give effect to my modest wishes. As for anyoutlay that may prove necessary, I have given proper explanation, in theletter to my brother-in-law, so that you, my brother, need not troubleyourself by giving way to much anxiety."
As Y�-ts'un bowed and expressed his appreciation in most profuselanguage,--
"Pray," he asked, "where does your honoured brother-in-law reside? andwhat is his official capacity? But I fear I'm too coarse in my manner,and could not presume to obtrude myself in his presence."
Ju-hai smiled. "And yet," he remarked, "this brother-in-law of mine isafter all of one and the same family as your worthy self, for he is thegrandson of the Duke Jung. My elder brother-in-law has now inherited thestatus of Captain-General of the first grade. His name is She, his styleNgen-hou. My second brother-in-law's name is Cheng, his style isTzu-chou. His present post is that of a Second class Secretary in theBoard of Works. He is modest and kindhearted, and has much in him of thehabits of his grandfather; not one of that purse-proud and haughty kindof men. That is why I have written to him and made the request on yourbehalf. Were he different to what he really is, not only would he cast aslur upon your honest purpose, honourable brother, but I myself likewisewould not have been as prompt in taking action."
When Y�-ts'un heard these remarks, he at length credited what had beentold him by Tzu-hsing the day before, and he lost no time in againexpressing his sense of gratitude to Lin Ju-hai.
Ju-hai resumed the conversation.
"I have fixed," (he explained,) "upon the second of next month, for myyoung daughter's departure for the capital, and, if you, brother mine,were to travel along with her, would it not be an advantage to herself,as well as to yourself?"
Y�-ts'un signified his acquiescence as he listened to his proposal;feeling in his inner self extremely elated.
Ju-hai availed himself of the earliest opportunity to get ready thepresents (for the capital) and all the requirements for the journey,which (when completed,) Y�-ts'un took over one by one. His pupil couldnot, at first, brook the idea, of a separation from her father, but thepressing wishes of her grandmother left her no course (but to comply).
"Your father," Ju-hai furthermore argued with her, "is already fifty;and I entertain no wish to marry again; and then you are always ailing;besides, with your extreme youth, you have, above, no mother of your ownto take care of you, and below, no sisters to attend to you. If you nowgo and have your maternal grandmother, as well as your mother's brothersand your cousins to depend upon, you will be doing the best thing toreduce the anxiety which I feel in my heart on your behalf. Why thenshould you not go?"
Tai-y�, after listening to what her father had to say, parted from himin a flood of tears and followed her nurse and several old matrons fromthe Jung mansion on board her boat, and set out on her journey.
Y�-ts'un had a boat to himself, and with two youths to wait on him, heprosecuted his voyage in the wake of Tai-y�.
By a certain day, they reached Ching Tu; and Y�-ts'un, after firstadjusting his hat and clothes, came, attended by a youth, to the door ofthe Jung mansion, and sent in a card, which showed his lineage.
Chia Cheng had, by this time, perused his brother-in-law's letter, andhe speedily asked him to walk in. When they met, he found in Y�-ts'un animposing manner and polite address.
This Chia Cheng had, in fact, a great penchant above all things for menof education, men courteous to the talented, respectful to the learned,ready to lend a helping hand to the needy and to succour the distressed,and was, to a great extent, like his grandfather. As it was besides awish intimated by his brother-in-law, he therefore treated Y�-ts'un witha consideration still more unusual, and readily strained all hisresources to assist him.
On the very day on which the memorial was submitted to the Throne, heobtained by his efforts, a reinstatement to office, and before theexpiry of two months, Y�-t'sun was forthwith selected to fill theappointment of prefect of Ying T'ien in Chin Ling. Taking leave of ChiaCheng, he chose a propitious day, and proceeded to his post, where wewill leave him without further notice for the present.
But to return to Tai-y�. On the day on which she left the boat, and themoment she put her foot on shore, there were forthwith at her disposalchairs for her own use, and carts for the luggage, sent over from theJung mansion.
Lin Tai-y� had often heard her mother recount how different was hergrandmother's house from that of other people's; and having seen forherself how above the common run were already the attendants of thethree grades, (sent to wait upon her,) in attire, in their fare, in alltheir articles of use, "how much more," (she thought to herself) "nowthat I am going to her home, must I be careful at every step, andcircumspect at every moment! Nor must I utter one word too many, normake one step more than is proper, for fear lest I should be ridiculedby any of them!"
From the moment she got into the chair, and they had entered within thecity walls, she found, as she looked around, through the gauze window,at the bustle in the streets and public places and at the immenseconcourse of people, everything naturally so unlike what she had seenelsewhere.
After they had also been a considerable time on the way, she suddenlycaught sight, at the northern end of the street, of two huge squattinglions of marble and of three lofty gates with (knockers representing)the heads of animals. In front of these gates, sat, in a row, about tenmen in coloured hats and fine attire. The main gate was not open. It wasonly through the side gates, on the east and west, that people went inand came out. Above the centre gate was a tablet. On this tablet wereinscribed in five large characters--"The Ning Kuo mansion erected byimperial command."
"This must be grandmother's eldest son's residence," reflected Tai-y�.
Towards the east, again, at no great distance, were three more highgateways, likewise of the same kind as those she had just seen. This wasthe Jung Kuo mansion.
They did not however go in by the main gate; but simply made theirentrance through the east side door.
With the sedans on their shoulders, (the bearers) proceeded about thedistance of the throw of an arrow, when upon turning a corner, theyhastily put down the chairs. The matrons, who came behind, one and allalso dismounted. (The bearers) were changed for four youths of seventeenor eighteen, with hats and clothes without a blemish, and while theycarried the chair, the whole bevy of matrons followed on foot.
When they reached a creeper-laden gate, the sedan was put down, and allthe youths stepped back and retired. The matrons came forward, raisedthe screen, and supported Tai-y� to descend from the chair.
Lin Tai-y� entered the door with the creepers, resting on the hand of amatron.
On both sides was a verandah, like two outstretched arms. An EntranceHall stood in the centre, in the middle of which was a door-screen of TaLi marble, set in an ebony frame. On the other side of this screen werethree very small halls. At the back of these came at once an extensivecourtyard, belonging to the main building.
In the front part were five parlours, the frieze of the ceiling of whichwas all carved, and the pillars ornamented. On either side, were coveredavenues, resembling passages through a rock. In the side-rooms weresuspended cages, full of parrots of every colour, thrushes, and birds ofevery description.
On the terrace-steps, sat several waiting maids, dressed in red andgreen, and the whole company of them advanced, with beaming faces, togreet them, when they saw the party approach. "Her venerable ladyship,"they said, "was at this very moment thinking of you, miss, and, by astrange coincidence, here you are."
Three or four of them forthwith vied with each other in raising the doorcurtain, while at the same time was heard some one announce: "Miss Linhas arrived."
No sooner had she entered the room, than she espied two servantssupporting a venerable lady, with silver-white hair, coming forward togreet her. Convinced that this lady must be her grandmother, she wasabout to prostrate herself and pay her obeisance, when she was quicklyclasped in the arms of her grandmother, who held her close against herbosom; and as she called her "my liver! my flesh!" (my love! mydarling!) she began to sob aloud.
The bystanders too, at once, without one exception, melted into tears;and Tai-y� herself found some difficulty in restraining her sobs. Littleby little the whole party succeeded in consoling her, and Tai-y� atlength paid her obeisance to her grandmother. Her ladyship thereuponpointed them out one by one to Tai-y�. "This," she said, "is the wife ofyour uncle, your mother's elder brother; this is the wife of your uncle,her second brother; and this is your eldest sister-in-law Chu, the wifeof your senior cousin Chu."
Tai-y� bowed to each one of them (with folded arms).
"Ask the young ladies in," dowager lady Chia went on to say; "tell thema guest from afar has just arrived, one who comes for the first time;and that they may not go to their lessons."
The servants with one voice signified their obedience, and two of themspeedily went to carry out her orders.
Not long after three nurses and five or six waiting-maids were seenushering in three young ladies. The first was somewhat plump in figureand of medium height; her cheeks had a congealed appearance, like afresh lichee; her nose was glossy like goose fat. She was gracious,demure, and lovable to look at.
The second had sloping shoulders, and a slim waist. Tall and slender wasshe in stature, with a face like the egg of a goose. Her eyes sobeautiful, with their well-curved eyebrows, possessed in their gaze abewitching flash. At the very sight of her refined and elegant mannersall idea of vulgarity was forgotten.
The third was below the medium size, and her mien was, as yet,childlike.
In their head ornaments, jewelry, and dress, the get-up of the threeyoung ladies was identical.
Tai-y� speedily rose to greet them and to exchange salutations. Afterthey had made each other's acquaintance, they all took a seat, whereuponthe servants brought the tea. Their conversation was confined toTai-y�'s mother,--how she had fallen ill, what doctors had attended her,what medicines had been given her, and how she had been buried andmourned; and dowager lady Chia was naturally again in great anguish.
"Of all my daughters," she remarked, "your mother was the one I lovedbest, and now in a twinkle, she has passed away, before me too, and I'venot been able to so much as see her face. How can this not make my heartsore-stricken?"
And as she gave vent to these feelings, she took Tai-y�'s hand in hers,and again gave way to sobs; and it was only after the members of thefamily had quickly made use of much exhortation and coaxing, that theysucceeded, little by little, in stopping her tears.
They all perceived that Tai-y�, despite her youthful years andappearance, was lady-like in her deportment and address, and that thoughwith her delicate figure and countenance, (she seemed as if) unable tobear the very weight of her clothes, she possessed, however, a certaincaptivating air. And as they readily noticed the symptoms of a weakconstitution, they went on in consequence to make inquiries as to whatmedicines she ordinarily took, and how it was that her complaint had notbeen cured.
"I have," explained Tai-y�, "been in this state ever since I was born;though I've taken medicines from the very time I was able to eat rice,up to the present, and have been treated by ever so many doctors ofnote, I've not derived any benefit. In the year when I was yet onlythree, I remember a mangy-headed bonze coming to our house, and sayingthat he would take me along, and make a nun of me; but my father andmother would, on no account, give their consent. 'As you cannot bear topart from her and to give her up,' he then remarked, 'her ailment will,I fear, never, throughout her life, be cured. If you wish to see her allright, it is only to be done by not letting her, from this day forward,on any account, listen to the sound of weeping, or see, with theexception of her parents, any relatives outside the family circle. Thenalone will she be able to go through this existence in peace and inquiet.' No one heeded the nonsensical talk of this raving priest; buthere am I, up to this very day, dosing myself with ginseng pills as atonic."
"What a lucky coincidence!" interposed dowager lady Chia; "some of thesepills are being compounded here, and I'll simply tell them to have anextra supply made; that's all."
Hardly had she finished these words, when a sound of laughter was heardfrom the back courtyard. "Here I am too late!" the voice said, "and notin time to receive the distant visitor!"
"Every one of all these people," reflected Tai-y�, "holds her peace andsuppresses the very breath of her mouth; and who, I wonder, is thiscoming in this reckless and rude manner?"
While, as yet, preoccupied with these thoughts, she caught sight of acrowd of married women and waiting-maids enter from the back room,pressing round a regular beauty.
The attire of this person bore no similarity to that of the youngladies. In all her splendour and lustre, she looked like a fairy or agoddess. In her coiffure, she had a band of gold filigree work,representing the eight precious things, inlaid with pearls; and worepins, at the head of each of which were five phoenixes in a rampantposition, with pendants of pearls. On her neck, she had a reddish goldnecklet, like coiled dragons, with a fringe of tassels. On her person,she wore a tight-sleeved jacket, of dark red flowered satin, coveredwith hundreds of butterflies, embroidered in gold, interspersed withflowers. Over all, she had a variegated stiff-silk pelisse, lined withslate-blue ermine; while her nether garments consisted of a jupe ofkingfisher-colour foreign crepe, brocaded with flowers.
She had a pair of eyes, triangular in shape like those of the redphoenix, two eyebrows, curved upwards at each temple, like willowleaves. Her stature was elegant; her figure graceful; her powdered facelike dawning spring, majestic, yet not haughty. Her carnation lips, longbefore they parted, betrayed a smile.
Tai-y� eagerly rose and greeted her.
Old lady Chia then smiled. "You don't know her," she observed. "This isa cunning vixen, who has made quite a name in this establishment! InNanking, she went by the appellation of vixen, and if you simply callher Feng Vixen, it will do."
Tai-y� was just at a loss how to address her, when all her cousinsinformed Tai-y�, that this was her sister-in-law Lien.
Tai-y� had not, it is true, made her acquaintance before, but she hadheard her mother mention that her eldest maternal uncle Chia She's son,Chia Lien, had married the niece of Madame Wang, her second brother'swife, a girl who had, from her infancy, purposely been nurtured tosupply the place of a son, and to whom the school name of Wang Hsi-fenghad been given.
Tai-y� lost no time in returning her smile and saluting her with allpropriety, addressing her as my sister-in-law. This Hsi-feng laid holdof Tai-y�'s hand, and minutely scrutinised her, for a while, from headto foot; after which she led her back next to dowager lady Chia, wherethey both took a seat.
"If really there be a being of such beauty in the world," sheconsequently observed with a smile, "I may well consider as having seteyes upon it to-day! Besides, in the air of her whole person, shedoesn't in fact look like your granddaughter-in-law, our worthyancestor, but in every way like your ladyship's own kindred-granddaughter! It's no wonder then that your venerable ladyshipshould have, day after day, had her unforgotten, even for a second, inyour lips and heart. It's a pity, however, that this cousin of mineshould have such a hard lot! How did it happen that our aunt died atsuch an early period?"
As she uttered these words, she hastily took her handkerchief and wipedthe tears from her eyes.
"I've only just recovered from a fit of crying," dowager lady Chiaobserved, as she smiled, "and have you again come to start me? Yourcousin has only now arrived from a distant journey, and she is sodelicate to boot! Besides, we have a few minutes back succeeded incoaxing her to restrain her sobs, so drop at once making any allusion toyour former remarks!"
This Hsi-feng, upon hearing these words, lost no time in converting hersorrow into joy.
"Quite right," she remarked. "But at the sight of my cousin, my wholeheart was absorbed in her, and I felt happy, and yet wounded at heart:but having disregarded my venerable ancestor's presence, I deserve to bebeaten, I do indeed!"
And hastily taking once more Tai-y�'s hand in her own: "How old are you,cousin?" she inquired; "Have you been to school? What medicines are youtaking? while you live here, you mustn't feel homesick; and if there'sanything you would like to eat, or to play with, mind you come and tellme! or should the waiting maids or the matrons fail in their duties,don't forget also to report them to me."
Addressing at the same time the matrons, she went on to ask, "Have MissLin's luggage and effects been brought in? How many servants has shebrought along with her? Go, as soon as you can, and sweep two lowerrooms and ask them to go and rest."
As she spake, tea and refreshments had already been served, and Hsi-fengherself handed round the cups and offered the fruits.
Upon hearing the question further put by her maternal aunt Secunda,"Whether the issue of the monthly allowances of money had been finishedor not yet?" Hsi-feng replied: "The issue of the money has also beencompleted; but a few moments back, when I went along with severalservants to the back upper-loft, in search of the satins, we looked forever so long, but we saw nothing of the kind of satins alluded to byyou, madame, yesterday; so may it not be that your memory misgives you?"
"Whether there be any or not, of that special kind, is of noconsequence," observed madame Wang. "You should take out," she thereforewent on to add, "any two pieces which first come under your hand, forthis cousin of yours to make herself dresses with; and in the evening,if I don't forget, I'll send some one to fetch them."
"I've in fact already made every provision," rejoined Hsi-feng; "knowingvery well that my cousin would be arriving within these two days, I havehad everything got ready for her. And when you, madame, go back, if youwill pass an eye over everything, I shall be able to send them round."
Madame Wang gave a smile, nodded her head assentingly, but uttered not aword by way of reply.
The tea and fruit had by this time been cleared, and dowager lady Chiadirected two old nurses to take Tai-y� to go and see her two maternaluncles; whereupon Chia She's wife, madame Hsing, hastily stood up andwith a smiling face suggested, "I'll take my niece over; for it willafter all be considerably better if I go!"
"Quite so!" answered dowager lady Chia, smiling; "you can go home too,and there will be no need for you to come over again!"
Madame Hsing expressed her assent, and forthwith led Tai-y� to takeleave of madame Wang. The whole party escorted them as far as the doorof the Entrance Hall, hung with creepers, where several youths had drawna carriage, painted light blue, with a kingfisher-coloured hood.
Madame Hsing led Tai-y� by the hand and they got up into their seats.The whole company of matrons put the curtain down, and then bade theyouths raise the carriage; who dragged it along, until they came to anopen space, where they at length put the mules into harness.
Going out again by the eastern side gate, they proceeded in an easterlydirection, passed the main entrance of the Jung mansion, and entered alofty doorway painted black. On the arrival in front of the ceremonialgate, they at once dismounted from the curricle, and madame Hsing,hand-in-hand with Tai-y�, walked into the court.
"These grounds," surmised Tai-y� to herself, "must have been originallyconverted from a piece partitioned from the garden of the Jung mansion."
Having entered three rows of ceremonial gates they actually caught sightof the main structure, with its vestibules and porches, all of which,though on a small scale, were full of artistic and unique beauty. Theywere nothing like the lofty, imposing, massive and luxurious style ofarchitecture on the other side, yet the avenues and rockeries, in thevarious places in the court, were all in perfect taste.
When they reached the interior of the principal pavilion, a largeconcourse of handmaids and waiting maids, got up in gala dress, werealready there to greet them. Madame Hsing pressed Tai-y� into a seat,while she bade some one go into the outer library and request Mr. ChiaShe to come over.
In a few minutes the servant returned. "Master," she explained, "says:'that he has not felt quite well for several days, that as the meetingwith Miss Lin will affect both her as well as himself, he does not forthe present feel equal to seeing each other, that he advises Miss Linnot to feel despondent or homesick; that she ought to feel quite at homewith her venerable ladyship, (her grandmother,) as well as her maternalaunts; that her cousins are, it is true, blunt, but that if all theyoung ladies associated together in one place, they may also perchancedispel some dulness; that if ever (Miss Lin) has any grievance, sheshould at once speak out, and on no account feel a stranger; andeverything will then be right."
Tai-y� lost no time in respectfully standing up, resuming her seat aftershe had listened to every sentence of the message to her. After a while,she said goodbye, and though madame Hsing used every argument to induceher to stay for the repast and then leave, Tai-y� smiled and said, "Ishouldn't under ordinary circumstances refuse the invitation to dinner,which you, aunt, in your love kindly extend to me, but I have still tocross over and pay my respects to my maternal uncle Secundus; if I wenttoo late, it would, I fear, be a lack of respect on my part; but I shallaccept on another occasion. I hope therefore that you will, dear aunt,kindly excuse me."
"If such be the case," madame Hsing replied, "it's all right." Andpresently directing two nurses to take her niece over, in the carriage,in which they had come a while back, Tai-y� thereupon took her leave;madame Hsing escorting her as far as the ceremonial gate, where she gavesome further directions to all the company of servants. She followed thecurricle with her eyes so long as it remained in sight, and at lengthretraced her footsteps.
Tai-y� shortly entered the Jung Mansion, descended from the carriage,and preceded by all the nurses, she at once proceeded towards the east,turned a corner, passed through an Entrance Hall, running east and west,and walked in a southern direction, at the back of the Large Hall. Onthe inner side of a ceremonial gate, and at the upper end of a spaciouscourt, stood a large main building, with five apartments, flanked onboth sides by out-houses (stretching out) like the antlers on the headof deer; side-gates, resembling passages through a hill, establishing athorough communication all round; (a main building) lofty, majestic,solid and grand, and unlike those in the compound of dowager lady Chia.
Tai-y� readily concluded that this at last was the main inner suite ofapartments. A raised broad road led in a straight line to the largegate. Upon entering the Hall, and raising her head, she first of allperceived before her a large tablet with blue ground, upon which figurednine dragons of reddish gold. The inscription on this tablet consistedof three characters as large as a peck-measure, and declared that thiswas the Hall of Glorious Felicity.
At the end, was a row of characters of minute size, denoting the year,month and day, upon which His Majesty had been pleased to confer thetablet upon Chia Yuan, Duke of Jung Kuo. Besides this tablet, werenumberless costly articles bearing the autograph of the Emperor. On thelarge black ebony table, engraved with dragons, were placed threeantique blue and green bronze tripods, about three feet in height. Onthe wall hung a large picture representing black dragons, such as wereseen in waiting chambers of the Sui dynasty. On one side stood a goldcup of chased work, while on the other, a crystal casket. On the groundwere placed, in two rows, sixteen chairs, made of hard-grained cedar.
There was also a pair of scrolls consisting of black-wood antitheticaltablets, inlaid with the strokes of words in chased gold. Their burdenwas this:
  On the platform shine resplendent pearls like sun or moon,  And the sheen of the Hall fa�ade gleams like russet sky.
Below, was a row of small characters, denoting that the scroll had beenwritten by the hand of Mu Shih, a fellow-countryman and old friend ofthe family, who, for his meritorious services, had the hereditary titleof Prince of Tung Ngan conferred upon him.
The fact is that madame Wang was also not in the habit of sitting andresting, in this main apartment, but in three side-rooms on the east, sothat the nurses at once led Tai-y� through the door of the eastern wing.
On a stove-couch, near the window, was spread a foreign red carpet. Onthe side of honour, were laid deep red reclining-cushions, with dragons,with gold cash (for scales), and an oblong brown-colouredsitting-cushion with gold-cash-spotted dragons. On the two sides, stoodone of a pair of small teapoys of foreign lacquer of peach-blossompattern. On the teapoy on the left, were spread out Wen Wang tripods,spoons, chopsticks and scent-bottles. On the teapoy on the right, werevases from the Ju Kiln, painted with girls of great beauty, in whichwere placed seasonable flowers; (on it were) also teacups, a tea serviceand the like articles.
On the floor on the west side of the room, were four chairs in a row,all of which were covered with antimacassars, embroidered withsilverish-red flowers, while below, at the feet of these chairs, stoodfour footstools. On either side, was also one of a pair of high teapoys,and these teapoys were covered with teacups and flower vases.
The other nick-nacks need not be minutely described.
The old nurses pressed Tai-y� to sit down on the stove-couch; but, onperceiving near the edge of the couch two embroidered cushions, placedone opposite the other, she thought of the gradation of seats, and didnot therefore place herself on the couch, but on a chair on the easternside of the room; whereupon the waiting maids, in attendance in thesequarters, hastened to serve the tea.
While Tai-y� was sipping her tea, she observed the headgear, dress,deportment and manners of the several waiting maids, which she reallyfound so unlike what she had seen in other households. She had hardlyfinished her tea, when she noticed a waiting maid approach, dressed in ared satin jacket, and a waistcoat of blue satin with scollops.
"My lady requests Miss Lin to come over and sit with her," she remarkedas she put on a smile.
The old nurses, upon hearing this message, speedily ushered Tai-y� againout of this apartment, into the three-roomed small main building by theeastern porch.
On the stove-couch, situated at the principal part of the room, wasplaced, in a transverse position, a low couch-table, at the upper end ofwhich were laid out, in a heap, books and a tea service. Against thepartition-wall, on the east side, facing the west, was a recliningpillow, made of blue satin, neither old nor new.
Madame Wang, however, occupied the lower seat, on the west side, onwhich was likewise placed a rather shabby blue satin sitting-rug, with aback-cushion; and upon perceiving Tai-y� come in she urged her at onceto sit on the east side.
Tai-y� concluded, in her mind, that this seat must certainly belong toChia Cheng, and espying, next to the couch, a row of three chairs,covered with antimacassars, strewn with embroidered flowers, somewhatalso the worse for use, Tai-y� sat down on one of these chairs.
But as madame Wang pressed her again and again to sit on the couch,Tai-y� had at length to take a seat next to her.
"Your uncle," madame Wang explained, "is gone to observe this day as afast day, but you'll see him by and bye. There's, however, one thing Iwant to talk to you about. Your three female cousins are all, it istrue, everything that is nice; and you will, when later on you cometogether for study, or to learn how to do needlework, or whenever, atany time, you romp and laugh together, find them all most obliging; butthere's one thing that causes me very much concern. I have here one, whois the very root of retribution, the incarnation of all mischief, onewho is a ne'er-do-well, a prince of malignant spirits in this family. Heis gone to-day to pay his vows in the temple, and is not back yet, butyou will see him in the evening, when you will readily be able to judgefor yourself. One thing you must do, and that is, from this time forth,not to pay any notice to him. All these cousins of yours don't ventureto bring any taint upon themselves by provoking him."
Tai-y� had in days gone by heard her mother explain that she had anephew, born into the world, holding a piece of jade in his mouth, whowas perverse beyond measure, who took no pleasure in his books, andwhose sole great delight was to play the giddy dog in the innerapartments; that her maternal grandmother, on the other hand, loved himso fondly that no one ever presumed to call him to account, so thatwhen, in this instance, she heard madame Wang's advice, she at once feltcertain that it must be this very cousin.
"Isn't it to the cousin born with jade in his mouth, that you arealluding to, aunt?" she inquired as she returned her smile. "When I wasat home, I remember my mother telling me more than once of this verycousin, who (she said) was a year older than I, and whose infant namewas Pao-y�. She added that his disposition was really wayward, but thathe treats all his cousins with the utmost consideration. Besides, nowthat I have come here, I shall, of course, be always together with myfemale cousins, while the boys will have their own court, and separatequarters; and how ever will there be any cause of bringing any slur uponmyself by provoking him?"
"You don't know the reasons (that prompt me to warn you)," repliedmadame Wang laughingly. "He is so unlike all the rest, all because hehas, since his youth up, been doated upon by our old lady! The fact isthat he has been spoilt, through over-indulgence, by being always in thecompany of his female cousins! If his female cousins pay no heed to him,he is, at any rate, somewhat orderly, but the day his cousins say oneword more to him than usual, much trouble forthwith arises, at theoutburst of delight in his heart. That's why I enjoin upon you not toheed him. From his mouth, at one time, issue sugared words andmellifluous phrases; and at another, like the heavens devoid of the sun,he becomes a raving fool; so whatever you do, don't believe all hesays."
Tai-y� was assenting to every bit of advice as it was uttered, whenunexpectedly she beheld a waiting-maid walk in. "Her venerable ladyshipover there," she said, "has sent word about the evening meal."
Madame Wang hastily took Tai-y� by the hand, and emerging by the door ofthe back-room, they went eastwards by the verandah at the back. Past theside gate, was a roadway, running north and south. On the southern sidewere a pavilion with three divisions and a Reception Hall with acolonnade. On the north, stood a large screen wall, painted white;behind it was a very small building, with a door of half the ordinarysize.
"These are your cousin Feng's rooms," explained madame Wang to Tai-y�,as she pointed to them smiling. "You'll know in future your way to comeand find her; and if you ever lack anything, mind you mention it to her,and she'll make it all right."
At the door of this court, were also several youths, who had recentlyhad the tufts of their hair tied together, who all dropped their handsagainst their sides, and stood in a respectful posture. Madame Wang thenled Tai-y� by the hand through a corridor, running east and west, intowhat was dowager lady Chia's back-court. Forthwith they entered the doorof the back suite of rooms, where stood, already in attendance, a largenumber of servants, who, when they saw madame Wang arrive, set to worksetting the tables and chairs in order.
Chia Chu's wife, n�e Li, served the eatables, while Hsi-feng placed thechopsticks, and madame Wang brought the soup in. Dowager lady Chia wasseated all alone on the divan, in the main part of the apartment, on thetwo sides of which stood four vacant chairs.
Hsi-feng at once drew Tai-y�, meaning to make her sit in the foremostchair on the left side, but Tai-y� steadily and concedingly declined.
"Your aunts and sisters-in-law, standing on the right and left," dowagerlady Chia smilingly explained, "won't have their repast in here, and asyou're a guest, it's but proper that you should take that seat."
Then alone it was that Tai-y� asked for permission to sit down, seatingherself on the chair.
Madame Wang likewise took a seat at old lady Chia's instance; and thethree cousins, Ying Ch'un and the others, having craved for leave to sitdown, at length came forward, and Ying Ch'un took the first chair on theright, T'an Ch'un the second, and Hsi Ch'un the second on the left.Waiting maids stood by holding in their hands, flips and finger-bowlsand napkins, while Mrs. Li and lady Feng, the two of them, kept near thetable advising them what to eat, and pressing them to help themselves.
In the outer apartments, the married women and waiting-maids inattendance, were, it is true, very numerous; but not even so much as thesound of the cawing of a crow could be heard.
The repast over, each one was presented by a waiting-maid, with tea in asmall tea tray; but the Lin family had all along impressed upon the mindof their daughter that in order to show due regard to happiness, and topreserve good health, it was essential, after every meal, to wait awhile, before drinking any tea, so that it should not do any harm to theintestines. When, therefore, Tai-y� perceived how many habits there werein this establishment unlike those which prevailed in her home, she toohad no alternative but to conform herself to a certain extent with them.Upon taking over the cup of tea, servants came once more and presentedfinger-bowls for them to rinse their mouths, and Tai-y� also rinsedhers; and after they had all again finished washing their hands, tea waseventually served a second time, and this was, at length, the tea thatwas intended to be drunk.
"You can all go," observed dowager lady Chia, "and let us alone to havea chat."
Madame Wang rose as soon as she heard these words, and having made a fewirrelevant remarks, she led the way and left the room along with the twoladies, Mrs. Li and lady Feng.
Dowager lady Chia, having inquired of Tai-y� what books she was reading,"I have just begun reading the Four Books," Tai-y� replied. "What booksare my cousins reading?" Tai-y� went on to ask.
"Books, you say!" exclaimed dowager lady Chia; "why all they know are afew characters, that's all."
The sentence was barely out of her lips, when a continuous sounding offootsteps was heard outside, and a waiting maid entered and announcedthat Pao-y� was coming. Tai-y� was speculating in her mind how it wasthat this Pao-y� had turned out such a good-for-nothing fellow, when hehappened to walk in.
He was, in fact, a young man of tender years, wearing on his head, tohold his hair together, a cap of gold of purplish tinge, inlaid withprecious gems. Parallel with his eyebrows was attached a circlet,embroidered with gold, and representing two dragons snatching a pearl.He wore an archery-sleeved deep red jacket, with hundreds of butterfliesworked in gold of two different shades, interspersed with flowers; andwas girded with a sash of variegated silk, with clusters of designs, towhich was attached long tassels; a kind of sash worn in the palace. Overall, he had a slate-blue fringed coat of Japanese brocaded satin, witheight bunches of flowers in relief; and wore a pair of light blue satinwhite-soled, half-dress court-shoes.
His face was like the full moon at mid-autumn; his complexion, likemorning flowers in spring; the hair along his temples, as if chiselledwith a knife; his eyebrows, as if pencilled with ink; his nose like asuspended gallbladder (a well-cut and shapely nose); his eyes likevernal waves; his angry look even resembled a smile; his glance, evenwhen stern, was full of sentiment.
Round his neck he had a gold dragon necklet with a fringe; also a cordof variegated silk, to which was attached a piece of beautiful jade.
As soon as Tai-y� became conscious of his presence, she was quite takenaback. "How very strange!" she was reflecting in her mind; "it wouldseem as if I had seen him somewhere or other, for his face appearsextremely familiar to my eyes;" when she noticed Pao-y� face dowagerlady Chia and make his obeisance. "Go and see your mother and then comeback," remarked her venerable ladyship; and at once he turned round andquitted the room.
On his return, he had already changed his hat and suit. All round hishead, he had a fringe of short hair, plaited into small queues, andbound with red silk. The queues were gathered up at the crown, and allthe hair, which had been allowed to grow since his birth, was plaitedinto a thick queue, which looked as black and as glossy as lacquer.Between the crown of the head and the extremity of the queue, hung astring of four large pearls, with pendants of gold, representing theeight precious things. On his person, he wore a long silvery-red coat,more or less old, bestrewn with embroidery of flowers. He had stillround his neck the necklet, precious gem, amulet of Recorded Name,philacteries, and other ornaments. Below were partly visible a fir-conecoloured brocaded silk pair of trousers, socks spotted with blackdesigns, with ornamented edges, and a pair of deep red, thick-soledshoes.
(Got up as he was now,) his face displayed a still whiter appearance, asif painted, and his eyes as if they were set off with carnation. As herolled his eyes, they brimmed with love. When he gave utterance tospeech, he seemed to smile. But the chief natural pleasing feature wasmainly centred in the curve of his eyebrows. The ten thousand and onefond sentiments, fostered by him during the whole of his existence, wereall amassed in the corner of his eyes.
His outward appearance may have been pleasing to the highest degree, butyet it was no easy matter to fathom what lay beneath it.
There are a couple of roundelays, composed by a later poet, (after theexcellent rhythm of the) Hsi Chiang Yueh, which depict Pao-y� in a mostadequate manner.
The roundelays run as follows:
  To gloom and passion prone, without a rhyme,  Inane and madlike was he many a time,  His outer self, forsooth, fine may have been,  But one wild, howling waste his mind within:  Addled his brain that nothing he could see;  A dunce! to read essays so loth to be!  Perverse in bearing, in temper wayward;  For human censure he had no regard.  When rich, wealth to enjoy he knew not how;  When poor, to poverty he could not bow.  Alas! what utter waste of lustrous grace!  To state, to family what a disgrace!  Of ne'er-do-wells below he was the prime,  Unfilial like him none up to this time.  Ye lads, pampered with sumptuous fare and dress,  Beware! In this youth's footsteps do not press!
But to proceed with our story.
"You have gone and changed your clothes," observed dowager lady Chia,"before being introduced to the distant guest. Why don't you yet saluteyour cousin?"
Pao-y� had long ago become aware of the presence of a most beautifulyoung lady, who, he readily concluded, must be no other than thedaughter of his aunt Lin. He hastened to advance up to her, and make hisbow; and after their introduction, he resumed his seat, whence heminutely scrutinised her features, (which he thought) so unlike those ofall other girls.
Her two arched eyebrows, thick as clustered smoke, bore a certain notvery pronounced frowning wrinkle. She had a pair of eyes, whichpossessed a cheerful, and yet one would say, a sad expression,overflowing with sentiment. Her face showed the prints of sorrow stampedon her two dimpled cheeks. She was beautiful, but her whole frame wasthe prey of a hereditary disease. The tears in her eyes glistened likesmall specks. Her balmy breath was so gentle. She was as demure as alovely flower reflected in the water. Her gait resembled a frail willow,agitated by the wind. Her heart, compared with that of Pi Kan, had onemore aperture of intelligence; while her ailment exceeded (in intensity)by three degrees the ailment of Hsi-Tzu.
Pao-y�, having concluded his scrutiny of her, put on a smile and said,"This cousin I have already seen in days gone by."
"There you are again with your nonsense," exclaimed lady Chia,sneeringly; "how could you have seen her before?"
"Though I may not have seen her, ere this," observed Pao-y� with asmirk, "yet when I look at her face, it seems so familiar, and to mymind, it would appear as if we had been old acquaintances; just as if,in fact, we were now meeting after a long separation."
"That will do! that will do!" remarked dowager lady Chia; "such beingthe case, you will be the more intimate."
Pao-y�, thereupon, went up to Tai-y�, and taking a seat next to her,continued to look at her again with all intentness for a good longwhile.
"Have you read any books, cousin?" he asked.
"I haven't as yet," replied Tai-y�, "read any books, as I have only beento school for a year; all I know are simply a few characters."
"What is your worthy name, cousin?" Pao-y� went on to ask; whereuponTai-y� speedily told him her name.
"Your style?" inquired Pao-y�; to which question Tai-y� replied, "I haveno style."
"I'll give you a style," suggested Pao-y� smilingly; "won't the doublestyle 'P'in P'in,' 'knitting brows,' do very well?"
"From what part of the standard books does that come?" T'an Ch'unhastily interposed.
"It is stated in the Thorough Research into the state of Creation fromremote ages to the present day," Pao-y� went on to explain, "that, inthe western quarter, there exists a stone, called Tai, (black,) whichcan be used, in lieu of ink, to blacken the eyebrows with. Besides theeyebrows of this cousin taper in a way, as if they were contracted, sothat the selection of these two characters is most appropriate, isn'tit?"
"This is just another plagiarism, I fear," observed T'an Ch'un, with anironic smirk.
"Exclusive of the Four Books," Pao-y� remarked smilingly, "the majorityof works are plagiarised; and is it only I, perchance, who plagiarise?Have you got any jade or not?" he went on to inquire, addressing Tai-y�,(to the discomfiture) of all who could not make out what he meant.
"It's because he has a jade himself," Tai-y� forthwith reasoned withinher mind, "that he asks me whether I have one or not.--No; I haven'tone," she replied. "That jade of yours is besides a rare object, and howcould every one have one?"
As soon as Pao-y� heard this remark, he at once burst out in a fit ofhis raving complaint, and unclasping the gem, he dashed it disdainfullyon the floor. "Rare object, indeed!" he shouted, as he heaped invectiveon it; "it has no idea how to discriminate the excellent from the mean,among human beings; and do tell me, has it any perception or not? I toocan do without this rubbish!"
All those, who stood below, were startled; and in a body they pressedforward, vying with each other as to who should pick up the gem.
Dowager lady Chia was so distressed that she clasped Pao-y� in herembrace. "You child of wrath," she exclaimed. "When you get into apassion, it's easy enough for you to beat and abuse people; but whatmakes you fling away that stem of life?"
Pao-y�'s face was covered with the traces of tears. "All my cousinshere, senior as well as junior," he rejoined, as he sobbed, "have nogem, and if it's only I to have one, there's no fun in it, I maintain!and now comes this angelic sort of cousin, and she too has none, so thatit's clear enough that it is no profitable thing."
Dowager lady Chia hastened to coax him. "This cousin of yours," sheexplained, "would, under former circumstances, have come here with ajade; and it's because your aunt felt unable, as she lay on herdeath-bed, to reconcile herself to the separation from your cousin, thatin the absence of any remedy, she forthwith took the gem belonging toher (daughter), along with her (in the grave); so that, in the firstplace, by the fulfilment of the rites of burying the living with thedead might be accomplished the filial piety of your cousin; and in thesecond place, that the spirit of your aunt might also, for the timebeing, use it to gratify the wish of gazing on your cousin. That's whyshe simply told you that she had no jade; for she couldn't very wellhave had any desire to give vent to self-praise. Now, how can you evercompare yourself with her? and don't you yet carefully and circumspectlyput it on? Mind, your mother may come to know what you have done!"
As she uttered these words, she speedily took the jade over from thehand of the waiting-maid, and she herself fastened it on for him.
When Pao-y� heard this explanation, he indulged in reflection, but couldnot even then advance any further arguments.
A nurse came at the moment and inquired about Tai-y�'s quarters, anddowager lady Chia at once added, "Shift Pao-y� along with me, into thewarm room of my suite of apartments, and put your mistress, Miss Lin,temporarily in the green gauze house; and when the rest of the winter isover, and repairs are taken in hand in spring in their rooms, anadditional wing can be put up for her to take up her quarters in."
"My dear ancestor," ventured Pao-y�; "the bed I occupy outside the greengauze house is very comfortable; and what need is there again for me toleave it and come and disturb your old ladyship's peace and quiet?"
"Well, all right," observed dowager lady Chia, after some consideration;"but let each one of you have a nurse, as well as a waiting-maid toattend on you; the other servants can remain in the outside rooms andkeep night watch and be ready to answer any call."
At an early hour, besides, Hsi-feng had sent a servant round with a greyflowered curtain, embroidered coverlets and satin quilts and other sucharticles.
Tai-y� had brought along with her only two servants; the one was her ownnurse, dame Wang, and the other was a young waiting-maid of sixteen,whose name was called Hs�eh Yen. Dowager lady Chia, perceiving thatHs�eh Yen was too youthful and quite a child in her manner, while nurseWang was, on the other hand, too aged, conjectured that Tai-y� would, inall her wants, not have things as she liked, so she detached twowaiting-maids, who were her own personal attendants, named Tzu Ch�an andYing Ko, and attached them to Tai-y�'s service. Just as had Ying Ch'unand the other girls, each one of whom had besides the wet nurses oftheir youth, four other nurses to advise and direct them, and exclusiveof two personal maids to look after their dress and toilette, four orfive additional young maids to do the washing and sweeping of the roomsand the running about backwards and forwards on errands.
Nurse Wang, Tzu Ch�an and other girls entered at once upon theirattendance on Tai-y� in the green gauze rooms, while Pao-y�'s wet-nurse,dame Li, together with an elderly waiting-maid, called Hsi Jen, were onduty in the room with the large bed.
This Hsi Jen had also been, originally, one of dowager lady Chia'sservant-girls. Her name was in days gone by, Chen Chu. As her venerableladyship, in her tender love for Pao-y�, had feared that Pao-y�'sservant girls were not equal to their duties, she readily handed her toPao-y�, as she had hitherto had experience of how sincere andconsiderate she was at heart.
Pao-y�, knowing that her surname was at one time Hua, and having onceseen in some verses of an ancient poet, the line "the fragrance offlowers wafts itself into man," lost no time in explaining the fact todowager lady Chia, who at once changed her name into Hsi Jen.
This Hsi Jen had several simple traits. While in attendance upon dowagerlady Chia, in her heart and her eyes there was no one but her venerableladyship, and her alone; and now in her attendance upon Pao-y�, herheart and her eyes were again full of Pao-y�, and him alone. But asPao-y� was of a perverse temperament and did not heed her repeatedinjunctions, she felt at heart exceedingly grieved.
At night, after nurse Li had fallen asleep, seeing that in the innerchambers, Tai-y�, Ying Ko and the others had not as yet retired to rest,she disrobed herself, and with gentle step walked in.
"How is it, miss," she inquired smiling, "that you have not turned in asyet?"
Tai-y� at once put on a smile. "Sit down, sister," she rejoined,pressing her to take a seat. Hsi Jen sat on the edge of the bed.
"Miss Lin," interposed Ying Ko smirkingly, "has been here in an awfulstate of mind! She has cried so to herself, that her eyes were flooded,as soon as she dried her tears. 'It's only to-day that I've come,' shesaid, 'and I've already been the cause of the outbreak of your youngmaster's failing. Now had he broken that jade, as he hurled it on theground, wouldn't it have been my fault? Hence it was that she was sowounded at heart, that I had all the trouble in the world, before Icould appease her."
"Desist at once, Miss! Don't go on like this," Hsi Jen advised her;"there will, I fear, in the future, happen things far more strange andridiculous than this; and if you allow yourself to be wounded andaffected to such a degree by a conduct such as his, you will, Iapprehend, suffer endless wounds and anguish; so be quick and dispelthis over-sensitive nature!"
"What you sisters advise me," replied Tai-y�, "I shall bear in mind, andit will be all right."
They had another chat, which lasted for some time, before they at lengthretired to rest for the night.
The next day, (she and her cousins) got up at an early hour and wentover to pay their respects to dowager lady Chia, after which upon comingto madame Wang's apartments, they happened to find madame Wang andHsi-feng together, opening the letters which had arrived from Chin Ling.There were also in the room two married women, who had been sent frommadame Wang's elder brother's wife's house to deliver a message.
Tai-y� was, it is true, not aware of what was up, but T'an Ch'un and theothers knew that they were discussing the son of her mother's sister,married in the Hs�eh family, in the city of Chin Ling, a cousin oftheirs, Hs�eh P'an, who relying upon his wealth and influence had, byassaulting a man, committed homicide, and who was now to be tried in thecourt of the Ying T'ien Prefecture.
Her maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t'eng, had now, on the receipt of thetidings, despatched messengers to bring over the news to the Chiafamily. But the next chapter will explain what was the ultimate issue ofthe wish entertained in this mansion to send for the Hs�eh family tocome to the capital.

CHAPTER IV.
  An ill-fated girl happens to meet an ill-fated young man.  The Hu Lu Bonze adjudicates the Hu Lu case.
Tai-y�, for we shall now return to our story, having come, along withher cousin to madame Wang's apartments, found madame Wang discussingcertain domestic occurrences with the messengers, who had arrived fromher elder brother's wife's home, and conversing also about the case ofhomicide, in which the family of her mother's sister had becomeinvolved, and other such relevant topics. Perceiving how pressing andperplexing were the matters in which madame Wang was engaged, the youngladies promptly left her apartments, and came over to the rooms of theirwidow sister-in-law, Mrs. Li.
This Mrs. Li had originally been the spouse of Chia Chu. Although Chuhad died at an early age, he had the good fortune of leaving behind hima son, to whom the name of Chia Lan was given. He was, at this period,just in his fifth year, and had already entered school, and appliedhimself to books.
This Mrs. Li was also the daughter of an official of note in Chin Ling.Her father's name was Li Shou-chung, who had, at one time, been ImperialLibationer. Among his kindred, men as well as women had all devotedthemselves to poetry and letters; but ever since Li Shou-chung continuedthe line of succession, he readily asserted that the absence of literaryattainments in his daughter was indeed a virtue, so that it soon cameabout that she did not apply herself in real earnest to learning; withthe result that all she studied were some parts of the "Four Books forwomen," and the "Memoirs of excellent women," that all she read did notextend beyond a limited number of characters, and that all she committedto memory were the examples of these few worthy female characters ofdynasties of yore; while she attached special importance to spinning andfemale handiwork. To this reason is to be assigned the name selected forher, of Li Wan (Li, the weaver), and the style of Kung Ts'ai (PalaceSempstress).
Hence it was that, though this Li Wan still continued, after the loss ofher mate, while she was as yet in the spring of her life, to live amidstaffluence and luxury, she nevertheless resembled in every respect ablock of rotten wood or dead ashes. She had no inclination whatsoever toinquire after anything or to listen to anything; while her sole andexclusive thought was to wait upon her relatives and educate her son;and, in addition to this, to teach her young sisters-in-law to doneedlework and to read aloud.
Tai-y� was, it is true, at this period living as a guest in the Chiamansion, where she certainly had the several young ladies to associatewith her, but, outside her aged father, (she thought) there was reallyno need for her to extend affection to any of the rest.
But we will now speak of Chia Y�-ts'un. Having obtained the appointmentof Prefect of Ying T'ien, he had no sooner arrived at his post than acharge of manslaughter was laid before his court. This had arisen fromsome rivalry between two parties in the purchase of a slave-girl, eitherof whom would not yield his right; with the result that a seriousassault occurred, which ended in homicide.
Y�-ts'un had, with all promptitude, the servants of the plaintiffsbrought before him, and subjected them to an examination.
"The victim of the assault," the plaintiffs deposed, "was your servants'master. Having on a certain day, purchased a servant-girl, sheunexpectedly turned out to be a girl who had been carried away and soldby a kidnapper. This kidnapper had, first of all, got hold of ourfamily's money, and our master had given out that he would on the thirdday, which was a propitious day, take her over into the house, butthis kidnapper stealthily sold her over again to the Hs�eh family. Whenwe came to know of this, we went in search of the seller to lay hold ofhim, and bring back the girl by force. But the Hs�eh party has been allalong _the_ bully of Chin Ling, full of confidence in his wealth,full of presumption on account of his prestige; and his arrogant menialsin a body seized our master and beat him to death. The murderous masterand his crew have all long ago made good their escape, leaving no tracebehind them, while there only remain several parties not concerned inthe affair. Your servants have for a whole year lodged complaints, butthere has been no one to do our cause justice, and we therefore imploreyour Lordship to have the bloodstained criminals arrested, and thusconduce to the maintenance of humanity and benevolence; and the living,as well as the dead, will feel boundless gratitude for this heavenlybounty."
When Y�-ts'un heard their appeal, he flew into a fiery rage. "What!" heexclaimed. "How could a case of such gravity have taken place as themurder of a man, and the culprits have been allowed to run awayscot-free, without being arrested? Issue warrants, and despatchconstables to at once lay hold of the relatives of the bloodstainedcriminals and bring them to be examined by means of torture."
Thereupon he espied a Retainer, who was standing by the judgment-table,wink at him, signifying that he should not issue the warrants. Y�-t'sungave way to secret suspicion, and felt compelled to desist.
Withdrawing from the Court-room, he retired into a private chamber, fromwhence he dismissed his followers, only keeping this single Retainer towait upon him.
The Retainer speedily advanced and paid his obeisance. "Your worship,"he said smiling, "has persistently been rising in official honours, andincreasing in wealth so that, in the course of about eight or nineyears, you have forgotten me."
"Your face is, however, extremely familiar," observed Y�-ts'un, "but Icannot, for the moment, recall who you are."
"Honourable people forget many things," remarked the Retainer, as hesmiled. "What! Have you even forgotten the place where you started inlife? and do you not remember what occurred, in years gone by, in the HuLu Temple?"
Y�-ts'un was filled with extreme astonishment; and past events thenbegan to dawn upon him.
The fact is that this Retainer had been at one time a young priest inthe Hu Lu temple; but as, after its destruction by fire, he had no placeto rest his frame, he remembered how light and easy was, after all, thiskind of occupation, and being unable to reconcile himself to thesolitude and quiet of a temple, he accordingly availed himself of hisyears, which were as yet few, to let his hair grow, and become aretainer.
Y�-ts'un had had no idea that it was he. Hastily taking his hand in his,he smilingly observed, "You are, indeed, an old acquaintance!" and thenpressed him to take a seat, so as to have a chat with more ease, but theRetainer would not presume to sit down.
"Friendships," Y�-ts'un remarked, putting on a smiling expression,"contracted in poor circumstances should not be forgotten! This is aprivate room; so that if you sat down, what would it matter?"
The Retainer thereupon craved permission to take a seat, and sat downgingerly, all awry.
"Why did you, a short while back," Y�-ts'un inquired, "not allow me toissue the warrants?"
"Your illustrious office," replied the Retainer, "has brought yourworship here, and is it likely you have not transcribed some philacteryof your post in this province!"
"What is an office-philactery?" asked Y�-ts'un with alacrity.
"Now-a-days," explained the Retainer, "those who become local officersprovide themselves invariably with a secret list, in which are enteredthe names and surnames of the most influential and affluent gentry ofnote in the province. This is in vogue in every province. Shouldinadvertently, at any moment, one give umbrage to persons of thisstatus, why, not only office, but I fear even one's life, it would bedifficult to preserve. That's why these lists are calledoffice-philacteries. This Hs�eh family, just a while back spoken of, howcould your worship presume to provoke? This case in question affords nodifficulties whatever in the way of a settlement; but the prefects, whohave held office before you, have all, by doing violence to the feelingsand good name of these people, come to the end they did."
As he uttered these words, he produced, from inside a purse which he hadhandy, a transcribed office-philactery, which he handed over toY�-ts'un; who upon perusal, found it full of trite and unpolishedexpressions of public opinion, with regard to the leading clans andnotable official families in that particular district. They ran asfollows:
The "Chia" family is not "chia," a myth; white jade form the Halls; goldcompose their horses! The "A Fang" Palace is three hundred li in extent,but is no fit residence for a "Shih" of Chin Ling. The eastern seas lackwhite jade beds, and the "Lung Wang," king of the Dragons, has come toask for one of the Chin Ling Wang, (Mr. Wang of Chin Ling.) In aplenteous year, snow, (Hs�eh,) is very plentiful; their pearls and gemsare like sand, their gold like iron.
Scarcely had Y�-ts'un done reading, when suddenly was heard theannouncement, communicated by the beating of a gong, that Mr. Wang hadcome to pay his respects.
Y�-ts'un hastily adjusted his official clothes and hat, and went out ofthe room to greet and receive the visitor. Returning after a short whilehe proceeded to question the Retainer (about what he had been perusing.)
"These four families," explained the Retainer, "are all interlaced byties of relationship, so that if you offend one, you offend all; if youhonour one, you honour all. For support and protection, they all havethose to take care of their interests! Now this Hs�eh, who is chargedwith homicide, is indeed the Hs�eh implied by 'in a plenteous year,(Hs�eh,) snow, is very plentiful.' In fact, not only has he these threefamilies to rely upon, but his (father's) old friends, and his ownrelatives and friends are both to be found in the capital, as well asabroad in the provinces; and they are, what is more, not few in number.Who is it then that your Worship purposes having arrested?"
When Y�-ts'un had heard these remarks, he forthwith put on a smile andinquired of the Retainer, "If what you say be true, how is then thislawsuit to be settled? Are you also perchance well aware of the place ofretreat of this homicide?"
"I don't deceive your Worship," the Retainer ventured smiling, "when Isay that not only do I know the hiding-place of this homicide, but thatI also am acquainted with the man who kidnapped and sold the girl; Ilikewise knew full well the poor devil and buyer, now deceased. Butwait, and I'll tell your worship all, with full details. This person,who succumbed to the assault, was the son of a minor gentry. His namewas Feng Y�an. His father and mother are both deceased, and he haslikewise no brothers. He looked after some scanty property in order toeke out a living. His age was eighteen or nineteen; and he had a strongpenchant for men's, and not much for women's society. But this was toothe retribution (for sins committed) in a previous existence! forcoming, by a strange coincidence, in the way of this kidnapper, who wasselling the maid, he straightway at a glance fell in love with thisgirl, and made up his mind to purchase her and make her his second wife;entering an oath not to associate with any male friends, nor even tomarry another girl. And so much in earnest was he in this matter that hehad to wait until after the third day before she could enter hishousehold (so as to make the necessary preparations for the marriage).But who would have foreseen the issue? This kidnapper quietly disposedof her again by sale to the Hs�eh family; his intention being to pocketthe price-money from both parties, and effect his escape. Contrary tohis calculations, he couldn't after all run away in time, and the twobuyers laid hold of him and beat him, till he was half dead; but neitherof them would take his coin back, each insisting upon the possession ofthe girl. But do you think that young gentleman, Mr. Hs�eh, would yieldhis claim to her person? Why, he at once summoned his servants and badethem have recourse to force; and, taking this young man Feng, theyassailed him till they made mincemeat of him. He was then carried backto his home, where he finally died after the expiry of three days. Thisyoung Mr. Hs�eh had previously chosen a day, on which he meant to setout for the capital, and though he had beaten the young man Feng todeath, and carried off the girl, he nevertheless behaved in the mannerof a man who had had no concern in the affair. And all he gave his mindto was to take his family and go along on his way; but not in any wisein order to evade (the consequences) of this (occurrence). This case ofhomicide, (he looked upon) as a most trivial and insignificant matter,which, (he thought), his brother and servants, who were on the spot,would be enough to settle. But, however, enough of this person. Now doesyour worship know who this girl is who was sold?"
"How could I possibly know?" answered Y�-ts'un.
"And yet," remarked the Retainer, as he laughed coldly, "this is aperson to whom you are indebted for great obligations; for she is no oneelse than the daughter of Mr. Chen, who lived next door to the Hu Lutemple. Her infant name is 'Ying Lien.'"
"What! is it really she?" exclaimed Y�-ts'un full of surprise. "I heardthat she had been kidnapped, ever since she was five years old; but hasshe only been sold recently?"
"Kidnappers of this kind," continued the Retainer, "only abduct infantgirls, whom they bring up till they reach the age of twelve or thirteen,when they take them into strange districts and dispose of them throughtheir agents. In days gone by, we used daily to coax this girl, YingLien, to romp with us, so that we got to be exceedingly friendly. Henceit is that though, with the lapse of seven or eight years, her mien hasassumed a more surpassingly lovely appearance, her general featureshave, on the other hand, undergone no change; and this is why I canrecognise her. Besides, in the centre of her two eyebrows, she had aspot, of the size of a grain of rice, of carnation colour, which she hashad ever since she was born into the world. This kidnapper, it alsohappened, rented my house to live in; and on a certain day, on which thekidnapper was not at home, I even set her a few questions. She said,'that the kidnapper had so beaten her, that she felt intimidated, andcouldn't on any account, venture to speak out; simply averring that thekidnapper was her own father, and that, as he had no funds to repay hisdebts, he had consequently disposed of her by sale!' I tried time aftertime to induce her to answer me, but she again gave way to tears andadded no more than: 'I don't really remember anything of my youth.' Ofthis, anyhow, there can be no doubt; on a certain day the young man Fengand the kidnapper met, said the money was paid down; but as thekidnapper happened to be intoxicated, Ying Lien exclaimed, as shesighed: 'My punishment has this day been consummated!' Later on again,when she heard that young Feng would, after three days, have her takenover to his house, she once more underwent a change and put on such asorrowful look that, unable to brook the sight of it, I waited till thekidnapper went out, when I again told my wife to go and cheer her byrepresenting to her that this Mr. Feng's fixed purpose to wait for apropitious day, on which to come and take her over, was ample proof thathe would not look upon her as a servant-girl. 'Furthermore,' (explainedmy wife to her), 'he is a sort of person exceedingly given to fasthabits, and has at home ample means to live upon, so that if, besides,with his extreme aversion to women, he actually purchases you now, at afancy price, you should be able to guess the issue, without anyexplanation. You have to bear suspense only for two or three days, andwhat need is there to be sorrowful and dejected?' After theseassurances, she became somewhat composed, flattering herself that shewould from henceforth have a home of her own.
"But who would believe that the world is but full of disappointments! Onthe succeeding day, it came about that the kidnapper again sold her tothe Hs�eh family! Had he disposed of her to any other party, no harmwould anyhow have resulted; but this young gentleman Hs�eh, who isnicknamed by all, 'the Foolish and overbearing Prince,' is the mostperverse and passionate being in the whole world. What is more, hethrows money away as if it were dust. The day on which he gave thethrashing with blows like falling leaves and flowing water, he dragged(_lit_. pull alive, drag dead) Ying Lien away more dead than alive,by sheer force, and no one, even up to this date, is aware whether shebe among the dead or the living. This young Feng had a spell of emptyhappiness; for (not only) was his wish not fulfilled, but on thecontrary he spent money and lost his life; and was not this a lamentablecase?"
When Y�-ts'un heard this account he also heaved a sigh. "This wasindeed," he observed, "a retribution in store for them! Their encounterwas likewise not accidental; for had it been, how was it that this FengY�an took a fancy to Ying Lien?
"This Ying Lien had, during all these years, to endure much harshtreatment from the hands of the kidnapper, and had, at length, obtainedthe means of escape; and being besides full of warm feeling, had heactually made her his wife, and had they come together, the event wouldcertainly have been happy; but, as luck would have it, there occurredagain this contretemps.
"This Hs�eh is, it is true, more laden with riches and honours than Fengwas, but when we bear in mind what kind of man he is he certainly, withhis large bevy of handmaids, and his licentious and inordinate habits,cannot ever be held equal to Feng Y�an, who had set his heart upon oneperson! This may appositely be termed a fantastic sentimental destiny,which, by a strange coincidence, befell a couple consisting of anill-fated young fellow and girl! But why discuss third parties? The onlything now is how to decide this case, so as to put things right."
"Your worship," remarked the Retainer smiling, "displayed, in years goneby, such great intelligence and decision, and how is it that today you,on the contrary, become a person without any resources! Your servant hasheard that the promotion of your worship to fill up this office is dueto the exertions of the Chia and Wang families; and as this Hs�eh P'anis a relative of the Chia mansion, why doesn't your worship take yourcraft along with the stream, and bring, by the performance of akindness, this case to an issue, so that you may again in days to come,be able to go and face the two Dukes Chia and Wang?"
"What you suggest," replied Y�-ts'un, "is, of course, right enough; butthis case involves a human life, and honoured as I have been, by HisMajesty the Emperor, by a restoration to office, and selection to anappointment, how can I at the very moment, when I may strain all myenergies to show my gratitude, by reason of a private consideration, setthe laws at nought? This is a thing which I really haven't the courageto do."
"What your worship says is naturally right and proper," remarked theRetainer at these words, smiling sarcastically, "but at the presentstage of the world, such things cannot be done. Haven't you heard thesaying of a man of old to the effect that great men take action suitableto the times. 'He who presses,' he adds, 'towards what is auspicious andavoids what is inauspicious is a perfect man.' From what your worshipsays, not only you couldn't, by any display of zeal, repay yourobligation to His Majesty, but, what is more, your own life you willfind it difficult to preserve. There are still three more considerationsnecessary to insure a safe settlement."
Y�-ts'un drooped his head for a considerable time.
"What is there in your idea to be done?" he at length inquired.
"Your servant," responded the Retainer, "has already devised a mostexcellent plan. It's this: To-morrow, when your Lordship sits in court,you should, merely for form's sake, make much ado, by despatchingletters and issuing warrants for the arrest of the culprits. Themurderer will naturally not be forthcoming; and as the plaintiffs willbe strong in their displeasure, you will of course have some members ofthe clan of the Hs�eh family, together with a few servants and others,taken into custody, and examined under torture, when your servant willbe behind the scenes to bring matters to a settlement, by bidding themreport that the victim had succumbed to a sudden ailment, and by urgingthe whole number of the kindred, as well as the headmen of the place, tohand in a declaration to that effect. Your Worship can aver that youunderstand perfectly how to write charms in dust, and conjure thespirit; having had an altar, covered with dust, placed in the court, youshould bid the military and people to come and look on to their heart'scontent. Your Worship can give out that the divining spirit hasdeclared: 'that the deceased, Feng Y�an, and Hs�eh P'an had been enemiesin a former life, that having now met in the narrow road, theirdestinies were consummated; that Hs�eh P'an has, by this time,contracted some indescribable disease and perished from the effects ofthe persecution of the spirit of Feng.' That as the calamity hadoriginated entirely from the action of the kidnapper, exclusive ofdealing with the kidnapper according to law, the rest need not beinterfered with, and so on. Your servant will be in the background tospeak to the kidnapper and urge him to make a full confession; and whenpeople find that the response of the divining spirit harmonizes with thestatements of the kidnapper, they will, as a matter of course, entertainno suspicion.
"The Hs�eh family have plenty of money, so that if your Worshipadjudicates that they should pay five hundred, they can afford it, orone thousand will also be within their means; and this sum can be handedto the Feng family to meet the outlay of burning incense and burialexpenses. The Feng family are, besides, people of not much consequence,and (the fuss made by them) being simply for money, they too will, whenthey have got the cash in hand, have nothing more to say. But may itplease your worship to consider carefully this plan and see what youthink of it?"
"It isn't a safe course! It isn't a safe course!" Y�-ts'un observed ashe smiled. "Let me further think and deliberate; and possibly bysucceeding in suppressing public criticism, the matter might also besettled."
These two closed their consultation by a fixed determination, and thenext day, when he sat in judgment, he marked off a whole company of theplaintiffs as well as of the accused, as were mentioned by name, and hadthem brought before him. Y�-ts'un examined them with additionalminuteness, and discovered in point of fact, that the inmates of theFeng family were extremely few, that they merely relied upon this chargewith the idea of obtaining some compensation for joss-sticks andburials; and that the Hs�eh family, presuming on their prestige andconfident of patronage, had been obstinate in the refusal to make anymutual concession, with the result that confusion had supervened, andthat no decision had been arrived at.
Following readily the bent of his feelings, Y�-ts'un disregarded thelaws, and adjudicated this suit in a random way; and as the Feng familycame in for a considerable sum, with which to meet the expense forincense and the funeral, they had, after all, not very much to say (inthe way of objections.)
With all despatch, Y�-ts'un wrote and forwarded two letters, one to ChiaCheng, and the other to Wang Tzu-t'eng, at that time commander-in-chiefof a Metropolitan Division, simply informing them: that the case, inwhich their worthy nephew was concerned, had come to a close, and thatthere was no need for them to give way to any extreme solicitude.
This case had been settled through the exclusive action of the youngpriest of the Hu Lu temple, now an official Retainer; and Y�-ts'un,apprehending, on the other hand, lest he might in the presence ofothers, divulge the circumstances connected with the days gone by, whenhe was in a state of penury, naturally felt very unhappy in his mind.But at a later period, he succeeded, by ultimately finding in him someshortcoming, and deporting him to a far-away place, in setting his fearsat rest.
But we will put Y�-ts'un on one side, and refer to the young man Hs�eh,who purchased Ying Lien, and assaulted Feng Yuan to death.
He too was a native of Chin Ling and belonged to a family literaryduring successive generations; but this young Hs�eh had recently, whenof tender age, lost his father, and his widowed mother out of pity forhis being the only male issue and a fatherless child, could not helpdoating on him and indulging him to such a degree, that when he, incourse of time, grew up to years of manhood, he was good for nothing.
In their home, furthermore, was the wealth of a millionaire, and theywere, at this time, in receipt of an income from His Majesty's privypurse, for the purvey of various articles.
This young Hs�eh went at school under the name of P'an. His style wasWen Ch'i. His natural habits were extravagant; his language haughty andsupercilious. He had, of course, also been to school, but all he knewwas a limited number of characters, and those not well. The whole daylong, his sole delight was in cock-fighting and horse-racing, ramblingover hills and doing the sights.
Though a Purveyor, by Imperial appointment, he had not the least idea ofanything relating to matters of business or of the world. All he wasgood for was: to take advantage of the friendships enjoyed by hisgrandfather in days of old, to present himself at the Board of Revenueto perfunctorily sign his name and to draw the allowance and rations;while the rest of his affairs he, needless to say, left his partners andold servants of the family to manage for him.
His widowed mother, a Miss Wang, was the youngest sister of WangTzu-t'eng, whose present office was that of Commander-in-Chief of aMetropolitan Division; and was, with Madame Wang, the spouse of ChiaCheng, of the Jung Kuo Mansion, sisters born of one mother. She was, inthis year, more or less forty years of age and had only one son: thisHs�eh P'an.
She also had a daughter, who was two years younger than Hs�eh P'an, andwhose infant name was Pao Ch'ai. She was beautiful in appearance, andelegant and refined in deportment. In days gone by, when her fatherlived, he was extremely fond of this girl, and had her read books andstudy characters, so that, as compared with her brother, she wasactually a hundred times his superior. Having become aware, ever sinceher father's death, that her brother could not appease the anguish ofher mother's heart, she at once dispelled all thoughts of books, andgave her sole mind to needlework, to the menage and other such concerns,so as to be able to participate in her mother's sorrow, and to bear thefatigue in lieu of her.
As of late the Emperor on the Throne held learning and propriety in highesteem, His Majesty called together and singled out talent and ability,upon which he deigned to display exceptional grace and favour. Besidesthe number called forth from private life and chosen as Imperialsecondary wives, the daughters of families of hereditary official statusand renown were without exception, reported by name to the authorities,and communicated to the Board, in anticipation of the selection formaids in waiting to the Imperial Princesses and daughters of ImperialPrinces in their studies, and for filling up the offices of persons ofeminence, to urge them to become excellent.
Ever since the death of Hs�eh P'an's father, the various assistants,managers and partners, and other employes in the respective provinces,perceiving how youthful Hs�eh P'an was in years, and how much he lackedworldly experience, readily availed themselves of the time to beginswindling and defrauding. The business, carried on in various differentplaces in the capital, gradually also began to fall off and to show adeficit.
Hs�eh P'an had all along heard that the capital was the _one_ placefor gaieties, and was just entertaining the idea of going on a visit,when he eagerly jumped at the opportunity (that presented itself,) firstof all to escort his sister, who was going to wait for the selection, inthe second place to see his relatives, and in the third to enterpersonally the capital, (professedly) to settle up long-standingaccounts, and to make arrangements for new outlays, but, in reality,with the sole purpose of seeing the life and splendour of themetropolis.
He therefore, had, at an early period, got ready his baggage and smallluggage, as well as the presents for relatives and friends, things ofevery description of local production, presents in acknowledgment offavours received, and other such effects, and he was about to choose aday to start on his journey when unexpectedly he came in the way of thekidnapper who offered Ying Lien for sale. As soon as Hs�eh P'an saw how_distingu�e_ Ying Lien was in her appearance, he formed theresolution of buying her; and when he encountered Feng Y�an, come withthe object of depriving him of her, he in the assurance of superiority,called his sturdy menials together, who set upon Feng Y�an and beat himto death. Forthwith collecting all the affairs of the household, andentrusting them one by one to the charge of some members of the clan andseveral elderly servants of the family, he promptly took his mother,sister and others and after all started on his distant journey, whilethe charge of homicide he, however, treated as child's play, flatteringhimself that if he spent a few filthy pieces of money, there was nodoubt as to its settlement.
He had been on his journey how many days, he had not reckoned, when, ona certain day, as they were about to enter the capital, he furthermoreheard that his maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t'eng, had been raised to therank of Supreme Governor of nine provinces, and had been honoured withan Imperial command to leave the capital and inspect the frontiers.
Hs�eh P'an was at heart secretly elated. "I was just lamenting," hethought, "that on my visit to the capital, I would have my maternaluncle to exercise control over me, and that I wouldn't be able to gamboland frisk to my heart's content, but now that he is leaving the capital,on promotion, it's evident that Heaven accomplishes man's wishes."
As he consequently held consultation with his mother; "Though we have,"he argued, "several houses of our own in the capital, yet for these lastten years or so, there has been no one to live in them, and the peoplecharged with the looking after them must unavoidably have stealthilyrented them to some one or other. It's therefore needful to let servantsgo ahead to sweep and get the place in proper order, before we can verywell go ourselves."
"What need is there to go to such trouble?" retorted his mother; "themain object of our present visit to the capital is first of all to payour respects to our relatives and friends; and it is, either at yourelder uncle's, my brother's place, or at your other uncle's, my sister'shusband's home, both of which families' houses are extremely spacious,that we can put up provisionally, and by and bye, at our ease, we cansend servants to make our house tidy. Now won't this be a considerablesaving of trouble?"
"My uncle, your brother," suggested Hs�eh P'an, "has just been raised toan appointment in an outside province, so that, of course, in his house,things must be topsy-turvey, on account of his departure; and should webetake ourselves, like a hive of bees and a long trail, to him forshelter; won't we appear very inconsiderate?"
"Your uncle," remarked his mother, "is, it is true, going on promotion,but there's besides the house of your aunt, my sister. What is more,during these last few years from both your uncle's and aunt's have, timeafter time, been sent messages, and letters forwarded, asking us to comeover; and now that we've come, is it likely, though your uncle is busywith his preparations to start on his journey, that your aunt of theChia family won't do all she can to press us to stay? Besides, were weto have our house got ready in a scramble, won't it make people think itstrange? I however know your idea very well that were we kept to stay atyour uncle's and aunt's, you won't escape being under strict restraint,unlike what would be the case were we to live in our own house, as youwould be free then to act as you please! Such being the case, go, onyour own account, and choose some place to take up your quarters in,while I myself, who have been separated from your aunt and cousins forthese several years, would however like to stay with them for a fewdays; and I'll go along with your sister and look up your aunt at herhome. What do you say; will this suit you or not?"
Hs�eh P'an, upon hearing his mother speak in this strain, knew wellenough that he could not bring her round from her determination; and hehad no help but to issue the necessary directions to the servants tomake straight for the Jung Kuo mansion. Madame Wang had by this timealready come to know that in the lawsuit, in which Hs�eh P'an wasconcerned, Chia Y�-ts'un had fortunately intervened and lent his goodoffices, and was at length more composed in her mind. But when she againsaw that her eldest brother had been advanced to a post on the frontier,she was just deploring that, deprived of the intercourse of therelatives of her mother's family, how doubly lonely she would feel;when, after the lapse of a few days, some one of the household broughtthe unexpected announcement that "our lady, your sister, has, with theyoung gentleman, the young lady and her whole household, entered thecapital and have dismounted from their vehicles outside the mainentrance." This news so delighted madame Wang that she rushed out, witha few attendants, to greet them in the large Entrance Hall, and broughtMrs. Hs�eh and the others into her house.
The two sisters were now reunited, at an advanced period of their lives,so that mixed feelings of sorrow and joy thronged together, but on theseit is, of course, needless to dilate.
After conversing for a time on what had occurred, subsequent to theirseparation, madame Wang took them to pay their obeisance to dowager ladyChia. They then handed over the various kinds of presents and indigenousarticles, and after the whole family had been introduced, a banquet wasalso spread to greet the guests.
Hs�eh P'an, having paid his respects to Chia Cheng and Chia Lien, waslikewise taken to see Chia She, Chia Chen and the other members.
Chia Cheng sent a messenger to tell madame Wang that "'aunt' Hs�eh hadalready seen many springs and autumns, while their nephew was of tenderage, with no experience, so that there was every fear, were he to liveoutside, that something would again take place. In the South-east cornerof our compound," (he sent word,) "there are in the Pear FragranceCourt, over ten apartments, all of which are vacant and lying idle; andwere we to tell the servants to sweep them, and invite 'aunt' Hs�eh andthe young gentleman and lady to take up their quarters there, it wouldbe an extremely wise thing."
Madame Wang had in fact been entertaining the wish to keep them to livewith them, when dowager lady Chia also sent some one to say that, "Mrs.Hs�eh should be asked to put up in the mansion in order that a greaterfriendliness should exist between them all."
Mrs. Hs�eh herself had all along been desirous to live in one place withher relatives, so as to be able to keep a certain check over her son,fearing that, if they lived in a separate house outside, the naturalbent of his habits would run riot, and that some calamity would bebrought on; and she therefore, there and then, expressed her sense ofappreciation, and accepted the invitation. She further privately toldmadame Wang in clear terms, that every kind of daily expense and generalcontribution would have to be entirely avoided and withdrawn as thatwould be the only thing to justify her to make any protracted stay. Andmadame Wang aware that she had, in her home, no difficulty in this line,promptly in fact complied with her wishes.
From this date it was that "aunt" Hs�eh and her children took up theirquarters in the Pear Fragrance Court.
This Court of Pear Fragrance had, we must explain, been at one time usedas a place for the quiet retirement of the Duke Jung in his advancedyears. It was on a small scale, but ingeniously laid out. There were, atleast, over ten structures. The front halls and the back houses were allin perfect style. There was a separate door giving on to the street, andthe people of the household of Hs�eh P'an used this door to go in andout. At the south-west quarter, there was also a side door, whichcommunicated with a narrow roadway. Beyond this narrow road, was theeastern court of madame Wang's principal apartment; so that every day,either after her repast, or in the evening, Mrs. Hs�eh would readilycome over and converse, on one thing and another, with dowager ladyChia, or have a chat with madame Wang; while Pao-ch'ai came together,day after day, with Tai y�, Ying-ch'un, her sisters and the other girls,either to read, to play chess, or to do needlework, and the pleasurewhich they derived was indeed perfect.
Hs�eh P'an however had all along from the first instance, been loth tolive in the Chia mansion, as he dreaded that with the disciplineenforced by his uncle, he would not be able to be his own master; buthis mother had made up her mind so positively to remain there, and whatwas more, every one in the Chia mansion was most pressing in theirefforts to keep them, that there was no alternative for him but to takeup his quarters temporarily there, while he at the same time directedservants to go and sweep the apartments of their own house, with a viewthat they should move into them when they were ready.
But, contrary to expectation, after they had been in their quarters fornot over a month, Hs�eh P'an came to be on intimate relations with allthe young men among the kindred of the Chia mansion, the half of whomwere extravagant in their habits, so that great was, of course, hisdelight to frequent them. To-day, they would come together to drinkwine; the next day to look at flowers. They even assembled to gamble, todissipate and to go everywhere and anywhere; leading, with all theirenticements, Hs�eh P'an so far astray, that he became far worse, by ahundred times, than he was hitherto.
Although it must be conceded that Chia Cheng was in the education of hischildren quite correct, and in the control of his family quitesystematic, yet in the first place, the clan was so large and themembers so numerous, that he was unable to attend to the entiresupervision; and, in the second place, the head of the family, at thisperiod, was Chia Chen, who, as the eldest grandchild of the Ningmansion, had likewise now come into the inheritance of the officialstatus, with the result that all matters connected with the clandevolved upon his sole and exclusive control. In the third place, publicas well as private concerns were manifold and complex, and being a manof negligent disposition, he estimated ordinary affairs of so littleconsequence that any respite from his official duties he devoted to nomore than the study of books and the playing of chess.
Furthermore, this Pear Fragrance Court was separated by two rows ofbuildings from his quarters and was also provided with a separate dooropening into the street, so that, being able at their own heart's desireto go out and to come in, these several young fellows could well indulgetheir caprices, and gratify the bent of their minds.
Hence it was that Hs�eh P'an, in course of time gradually extinguishedfrom his memory every idea of shifting their quarters.
But what transpired, on subsequent days, the following chapter willexplain.

CHAPTER V.
  The spirit of Chia Pao-y� visits the confines of the Great Void.  The Monitory Vision Fairy expounds, in ballads, the Dream of the Red      Chamber.
Having in the fourth Chapter explained, to some degree, thecircumstances attending the settlement of the mother and children of theHs�eh family in the Jung mansion, and other incidental matters, we willnow revert to Lin Tai-y�.
Ever since her arrival in the Jung mansion, dowager lady Chia showed herthe highest sympathy and affection, so that in everything connected withsleeping, eating, rising and accommodation she was on the same footingas Pao-y�; with the result that Ying Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and T'an Ch'un,her three granddaughters, had after all to take a back seat. In fact,the intimate and close friendliness and love which sprung up between thetwo persons Pao-y� and Tai-y�, was, in the same degree, of anexceptional kind, as compared with those existing between the others. Bydaylight they were wont to walk together, and to sit together. At night,they would desist together, and rest together. Really it was a case ofharmony in language and concord in ideas, of the consistency of varnishor of glue, (a close friendship), when at this unexpected juncture therecame this girl, Hs�eh Pao-ch'ai, who, though not very much older inyears (than the others), was, nevertheless, in manner so correct, and infeatures so beautiful that the consensus of opinion was that Tai-y�herself could not come up to her standard.
What is more, in her ways Pao-Ch'ai was so full of good tact, soconsiderate and accommodating, so unlike Tai-y�, who was supercilious,self-confident, and without any regard for the world below, that thenatural consequence was that she soon completely won the hearts of thelower classes. Even the whole number of waiting-maids would also for themost part, play and joke with Pao-ch'ai. Hence it was that Tai-y�fostered, in her heart, considerable feelings of resentment, but of thishowever Pao-ch'ai had not the least inkling.
Pao-y� was, likewise, in the prime of his boyhood, and was, besides, asfar as the bent of his natural disposition was concerned, in everyrespect absurd and perverse; regarding his cousins, whether male orfemale, one and all with one common sentiment, and without anydistinction whatever between the degrees of distant or closerelationship. Sitting and sleeping, as he now was under the same roofwith Tai-y� in dowager lady Chia's suite of rooms, he naturally becamecomparatively more friendly with her than with his other cousins; andthis friendliness led to greater intimacy and this intimacy onceestablished, rendered unavoidable the occurrence of the blight ofharmony from unforeseen slight pretexts.
These two had had on this very day, for some unknown reason, wordsbetween them more or less unfriendly, and Tai-y� was again sitting allalone in her room, giving way to tears. Pao-y� was once more withinhimself quite conscience-smitten for his ungraceful remarks, and comingforward, he humbly made advances, until, at length, Tai-y� little bylittle came round.
As the plum blossom, in the eastern part of the garden of the Ningmansion, was in full bloom, Chia Chen's spouse, Mrs. Yu, madepreparations for a collation, (purposing) to send invitations to dowagerlady Chia, mesdames Hsing, and Wang, and the other members of thefamily, to come and admire the flowers; and when the day arrived thefirst thing she did was to take Chia Jung and his wife, the two of them,and come and ask them round in person. Dowager lady Chia and the otherinmates crossed over after their early meal; and they at once promenadedthe Hui Fang (Concentrated Fragrance) Garden. First tea was served, andnext wine; but the entertainment was no more than a family banquet ofthe kindred of the two mansions of Ning and Jung, so that there was atotal lack of any novel or original recreation that could be put onrecord.
After a little time, Pao-y� felt tired and languid and inclined for hismidday siesta. "Take good care," dowager lady Chia enjoined some ofthem, "and stay with him, while he rests for a while, when he can comeback;" whereupon Chia Jung's wife, Mrs. Ch'in, smiled and said witheagerness: "We got ready in here a room for uncle Pao, so let yourvenerable ladyship set your mind at ease. Just hand him over to mycharge, and he will be quite safe. Mothers and sisters," she continued,addressing herself to Pao-y�'s nurses and waiting maids, "invite unclePao to follow me in here."
Dowager lady Chia had always been aware of the fact that Mrs. Ch'in wasa most trustworthy person, naturally courteous and scrupulous, and inevery action likewise so benign and gentle; indeed the most estimableamong the whole number of her great grandsons' wives, so that when shesaw her about to go and attend to Pao-y�, she felt that, for acertainty, everything would be well.
Mrs. Ch'in, there and then, led away a company of attendants, and cameinto the rooms inside the drawing room. Pao-y�, upon raising his head,and catching sight of a picture hung on the upper wall, representing ahuman figure, in perfect style, the subject of which was a portrait ofYen Li, speedily felt his heart sink within him.
There was also a pair of scrolls, the text of which was:
  A thorough insight into worldly matters arises from knowledge;  A clear perception of human nature emanates from literary lore.
On perusal of these two sentences, albeit the room was sumptuous andbeautifully laid out, he would on no account remain in it. "Let us go atonce," he hastened to observe, "let us go at once."
Mrs. Ch'in upon hearing his objections smiled. "If this," she said, "isreally not nice, where are you going? if you won't remain here, wellthen come into my room."
Pao-y� nodded his head and gave a faint grin.
"Where do you find the propriety," a nurse thereupon interposed, "of anuncle going to sleep in the room of a nephew's wife?"
"Ai ya!" exclaimed Mrs. Ch'in laughing, "I don't mind whether he getsangry or not (at what I say); but how old can he be as to reverentiallyshun all these things? Why my brother was with me here last month;didn't you see him? he's, true enough, of the same age as uncle Pao, butwere the two of them to stand side by side, I suspect that he would bemuch higher in stature."
"How is it," asked Pao-y�, "that I didn't see him? Bring him along andlet me have a look at him!"
"He's separated," they all ventured as they laughed, "by a distance oftwenty or thirty li, and how can he be brought along? but you'll see himsome day."
As they were talking, they reached the interior of Mrs. Ch'in'sapartments. As soon as they got in, a very faint puff of sweet fragrancewas wafted into their nostrils. Pao-y� readily felt his eyes itch andhis bones grow weak. "What a fine smell!" he exclaimed severalconsecutive times.
Upon entering the apartments, and gazing at the partition wall, he saw apicture the handiwork of T'ang Po-hu, consisting of Begonias drooping inthe spring time; on either side of which was one of a pair of scrolls,written by Ch'in Tai-hs�, a Literary Chancellor of the Sung era, runningas follows:
  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man, because the spring      is cold.  The fragrant whiff, which wafts itself into man's nose, is the perfume      of wine!
On the table was a mirror, one which had been placed, in days of yore,in the Mirror Palace of the Emperor Wu Tse-t'ien. On one side stood agold platter, in which Fei Yen, who lived in the Ch'ao state, used tostand and dance. In this platter, was laid a quince, which An Lu-shanhad flung at the Empress T'ai Chen, inflicting a wound on her breast. Inthe upper part of the room, stood a divan ornamented with gems, on whichthe Emperor's daughter, Shou Ch'ang, was wont to sleep, in the Han ChangPalace Hanging, were curtains embroidered with strings of pearls, byT'ung Ch'ang, the Imperial Princess.
"It's nice in here, it's nice in here," exclaimed Pao-y� with a chuckle.
"This room of mine," observed Mrs. Ch'in smilingly, "is I think, goodenough for even spirits to live in!" and, as she uttered these words,she with her own hands, opened a gauze coverlet, which had been washedby Hsi Shih, and removed a bridal pillow, which had been held in thearms of Hung Niang. Instantly, the nurses attended to Pao-y�, until hehad laid down comfortably; when they quietly dispersed, leaving only thefour waiting maids: Hsi Jen, Ch'iu Wen, Ch'ing Wen and She Yueh to keephim company.
"Mind be careful, as you sit under the eaves," Mrs. Ch'in recommendedthe young waiting maids, "that the cats do not start a fight!"
Pao-y� then closed his eyes, and, little by little, became drowsy, andfell asleep.
It seemed to him just as if Mrs. Ch'in was walking ahead of him.Forthwith, with listless and unsettled step, he followed Mrs. Ch'in tosome spot or other, where he saw carnation-like railings, jade-likesteps, verdant trees and limpid pools--a spot where actually no trace ofany human being could be met with, where of the shifting mundane dustlittle had penetrated.
Pao-y� felt, in his dream, quite delighted. "This place," he mused, "ispleasant, and I may as well spend my whole lifetime in here! though Imay have to lose my home, I'm quite ready for the sacrifice, for it'sfar better being here than being flogged, day after day, by father,mother, and teacher."
While he pondered in this erratic strain, he suddenly heard the voice ofsome human being at the back of the rocks, giving vent to this song:
  Like scattering clouds doth fleet a vernal dream;  The transient flowers pass like a running stream;  Maidens and youths bear this, ye all, in mind;  In useless grief what profit will ye find?
Pao-y� perceived that the voice was that of a girl. The song was barelyat an end, when he soon espied in the opposite direction, a beautifulgirl advancing with majestic and elastic step; a girl quite unlike anyordinary mortal being. There is this poem, which gives an adequatedescription of her:
  Lo she just quits the willow bank; and sudden now she issues from the      flower-bedecked house;  As onward alone she speeds, she startles the birds perched in the      trees, by the pavilion; to which as she draws nigh, her shadow      flits by the verandah!  Her fairy clothes now flutter in the wind! a fragrant perfume like      unto musk or olea is wafted in the air; Her apparel lotus-like is      sudden wont to move; and the jingle of her ornaments strikes the      ear.  Her dimpled cheeks resemble, as they smile, a vernal peach; her      kingfisher coiffure is like a cumulus of clouds; her lips part      cherry-like; her pomegranate-like teeth conceal a fragrant      breath.  Her slender waist, so beauteous to look at, is like the skipping snow      wafted by a gust of wind; the sheen of her pearls and kingfisher      trinkets abounds with splendour, green as the feathers of a duck,      and yellow as the plumes of a goose;  Now she issues to view, and now is hidden among the flowers; beautiful      she is when displeased, beautiful when in high spirits; with      lissome step, she treads along the pond, as if she soars on wings      or sways in the air.  Her eyebrows are crescent moons, and knit under her smiles; she      speaks, and yet she seems no word to utter; her lotus-like feet      with ease pursue their course; she stops, and yet she seems still      to be in motion; the charms of her figure all vie with ice in      purity, and in splendour with precious gems; Lovely is her      brilliant attire, so full of grandeur and refined grace.  Loveable her countenance, as if moulded from some fragrant substance,      or carved from white jade; elegant is her person, like a phoenix,      dignified like a dragon soaring high.  What is her chastity like? Like a white plum in spring with snow      nestling in its broken skin; Her purity? Like autumn orchids      bedecked with dewdrops.  Her modesty? Like a fir-tree growing in a barren plain; Her      comeliness? Like russet clouds reflected in a limpid pool.  Her gracefulness? Like a dragon in motion wriggling in a stream;      Her refinement? Like the rays of the moon shooting on to a cool      river.  Sure is she to put Hsi Tzu to shame! Bound to put Wang Ch'iang to the      blush! What a remarkable person! Where was she born? and whence      does she come?  One thing is true that in Fairy-land there is no second like her! that      in the Purple Courts of Heaven there is no one fit to be her peer!  Forsooth, who can it be, so surpassingly beautiful!
Pao-y�, upon realising that she was a fairy, was much elated; and witheagerness advanced and made a bow.
"My divine sister," he ventured, as he put on a smile. "I don't knowwhence you come, and whither you are going. Nor have I any idea whatthis place is, but I make bold to entreat that you would take my handand lead me on."
"My abode," replied the Fairy, "is above the Heavens of DivestedAnimosities, and in the ocean of Discharged Sorrows. I'm the Fairy ofMonitory Vision, of the cave of Drooping Fragrance, in the mount ofEmitted Spring, within the confines of the Great Void. I preside overthe voluptuous affections and sensual debts among the mortal race, andsupervise in the dusty world, the envies of women and the lusts of man.It's because I've recently come to hear that the retribution forvoluptuousness extends up to this place, that I betake myself here inorder to find suitable opportunities of disseminating mutual affections.My encounter with you now is also not a matter of accident! This spot isnot distant from my confines. I have nothing much there besides a cup ofthe tender buds of tea plucked by my own hands, and a pitcher ofluscious wine, fermented by me as well as several spritelike singing anddancing maidens of great proficiency, and twelve ballads of spiritualsong, recently completed, on the Dream of the Red Chamber; but won't youcome along with me for a stroll?"
Pao-y�, at this proposal, felt elated to such an extraordinary degreethat he could skip from joy, and there and then discarding from his mindall idea of where Mrs. Ch'in was, he readily followed the Fairy.
They reached some spot, where there was a stone tablet, put up in ahorizontal position, on which were visible the four large characters:"The confines of the Great Void," on either side of which was one of apair of scrolls, with the two antithetical sentences:
  When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false;  When naught be made to aught, aught changes into naught!
Past the Portal stood the door of a Palace, and horizontally, above thisdoor, were the four large characters: "The Sea of Retribution, theHeaven of Love." There were also a pair of scrolls, with the inscriptionin large characters:
  Passion, alas! thick as the earth, and lofty as the skies, from ages      past to the present hath held incessant sway;  How pitiful your lot! ye lustful men and women envious, that your      voluptuous debts should be so hard to pay!
Pao-y�, after perusal, communed with his own heart. "Is it really so!"he thought, "but I wonder what implies the passion from old till now,and what are the voluptuous debts! Henceforward, I must enlightenmyself!"
Pao-y� was bent upon this train of thoughts when he unwittinglyattracted several evil spirits into his heart, and with speedy step hefollowed in the track of the fairy, and entered two rows of doors whenhe perceived that the Lateral Halls were, on both sides, full of tabletsand scrolls, the number of which he could not in one moment ascertain.He however discriminated in numerous places the inscriptions: The Boardof Lustful Love; the Board of contracted grudges; The Board of Matutinalsobs; the Board of nocturnal tears; the Board of vernal affections; andthe Board of autumnal anguish.
After he had perused these inscriptions, he felt impelled to turn roundand address the Fairy. "May I venture to trouble my Fairy," he said, "totake me along for a turn into the interior of each of these Boards? MayI be allowed, I wonder, to do so?"
"Inside each of these Boards," explained the Fairy, "are accumulated theregisters with the records of all women of the whole world; of those whohave passed away, as well as of those who have not as yet come into it,and you, with your mortal eyes and human body, could not possibly beallowed to know anything in anticipation."
But would Pao-y�, upon hearing these words, submit to this decree? Hewent on to implore her permission again and again, until the Fairycasting her eye upon the tablet of the board in front of her observed,"Well, all right! you may go into this board and reap some transientpleasure."
Pao-y� was indescribably joyous, and, as he raised his head, heperceived that the text on the tablet consisted of the three characters:the Board of Ill-fated lives; and that on each side was a scroll withthe inscription:
  Upon one's self are mainly brought regrets in spring and autumn gloom;  A face, flowerlike may be and moonlike too; but beauty all for whom?
Upon perusal of the scroll Pao-y� was, at once, the more stirred withadmiration; and, as he crossed the door, and reached the interior, theonly things that struck his eye were about ten large presses, the wholenumber of which were sealed with paper slips; on every one of theseslips, he perceived that there were phrases peculiar to each province.
Pao-y� was in his mind merely bent upon discerning, from the rest, theslip referring to his own native village, when he espied, on the otherside, a slip with the large characters: "the Principal Record of theTwelve Maidens of Chin Ling."
"What is the meaning," therefore inquired Pao-y�, "of the PrincipalRecord of the Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling?"
"As this is the record," explained the Fairy, "of the most excellent andprominent girls in your honourable province, it is, for this reason,called the Principal Record."
"I've often heard people say," observed Pao-y�, "that Chin Ling is ofvast extent; and how can there only be twelve maidens in it! why, atpresent, in our own family alone, there are more or less severalhundreds of young girls!"
The Fairy gave a faint smile. "Through there be," she rejoined, "solarge a number of girls in your honourable province, those only of anynote have been selected and entered in this record. The two presses, onthe two sides, contain those who are second best; while, for all whoremain, as they are of the ordinary run, there are, consequently, noregisters to make any entry of them in."
Pao-y� upon looking at the press below, perceived the inscription:"Secondary Record of the twelve girls of Chin Ling;" while again inanother press was inscribed: "Supplementary Secondary Record of theTwelve girls of Chin Ling." Forthwith stretching out his hand, Pao-y�opened first the doors of the press, containing the "supplementarysecondary Record," extracted a volume of the registers, and opened it.When he came to examine it, he saw on the front page a representation ofsomething, which, though bearing no resemblance to a human being,presented, at the same time, no similitude to scenery; consisting simplyof huge blotches made with ink. The whole paper was full of nothing elsebut black clouds and turbid mists, after which appeared the traces of afew characters, explaining that--
  A cloudless moon is rare forsooth to see,  And pretty clouds so soon scatter and flee!  Thy heart is deeper than the heavens are high,  Thy frame consists of base ignominy!  Thy looks and clever mind resentment will provoke,  And thine untimely death vile slander will evoke!  A loving noble youth in vain for love will yearn.
After reading these lines, Pao-y� looked below, where was pictured abouquet of fresh flowers and a bed covered with tattered matting. Therewere also several distiches running as follows:
  Thy self-esteem for kindly gentleness is but a fancy vain!  Thy charms that they can match the olea or orchid, but thoughts inane!  While an actor will, envious lot! with fortune's smiles be born,  A youth of noble birth will, strange to say, be luckless and forlorn.
Pao-y� perused these sentences, but could not unfold their meaning, so,at once discarding this press, he went over and opened the door of thepress of the "Secondary Records" and took out a book, in which, onexamination, he found a representation of a twig of Olea fragrans.Below, was a pond, the water of which was parched up and the mud dry,the lotus flowers decayed, and even the roots dead. At the back werethese lines:
  The lotus root and flower but one fragrance will give;  How deep alas! the wounds of thy life's span will be;  What time a desolate tree in two places will live,  Back to its native home the fragrant ghost will flee!
Pao-y� read these lines, but failed to understand what they meant. Hethen went and fetched the "Principal Record," and set to looking itover. He saw on the first page a picture of two rotten trees, while onthese trees was suspended a jade girdle. There was also a heap of snow,and under this snow was a golden hair-pin. There were in addition thesefour lines in verse:
  Bitter thy cup will be, e'en were the virtue thine to stop the loom,  Thine though the gift the willow fluff to sing, pity who will thy      doom?  High in the trees doth hang the girdle of white jade,  And lo! among the snow the golden pin is laid!
To Pao-y� the meaning was again, though he read the lines over, quiteunintelligible. He was, about to make inquiries, but he felt convincedthat the Fairy would be both to divulge the decrees of Heaven; andthough intent upon discarding the book, he could not however tearhimself away from it. Forthwith, therefore, he prosecuted a furtherperusal of what came next, when he caught sight of a picture of a bow.On this bow hung a citron. There was also this ode:
  Full twenty years right and wrong to expound will be thy fate!  What place pomegranate blossoms come in bloom will face the Palace      Gate!  The third portion of spring, of the first spring in beauty short will      fall!  When tiger meets with hare thou wilt return to sleep perennial.
Further on, was also a sketch of two persons flying a kite; a broadexpanse of sea, and a large vessel; while in this vessel was a girl, whoscreened her face bedewed with tears. These four lines were likewisevisible:
  Pure and bright will be thy gifts, thy purpose very high;  But born thou wilt be late in life and luck be passed by;  At the tomb feast thou wilt repine tearful along the stream,  East winds may blow, but home miles off will be, even in dream.
After this followed a picture of several streaks of fleeting clouds, andof a creek whose waters were exhausted, with the text:
  Riches and honours too what benefit are they?  In swaddling clothes thou'lt be when parents pass away;  The rays will slant, quick as the twinkle of an eye;  The Hsiang stream will recede, the Ch'u clouds onward fly!
Then came a picture of a beautiful gem, which had fallen into the mire,with the verse:
  Thine aim is chastity, but chaste thou wilt not be;  Abstraction is thy faith, but void thou may'st not see;  Thy precious, gemlike self will, pitiful to say,  Into the mundane mire collapse at length some day.
A rough sketch followed of a savage wolf, in pursuit of a beautifulgirl, trying to pounce upon her as he wished to devour her. This was theburden of the distich:
  Thy mate is like a savage wolf prowling among the hills;  His wish once gratified a haughty spirit his heart fills!  Though fair thy form like flowers or willows in the golden moon,  Upon the yellow beam to hang will shortly be its doom.
Below, was an old temple, in the interior of which was a beautifulperson, just in the act of reading the religious manuals, as she sat allalone; with this inscription:
  In light esteem thou hold'st the charms of the three springs for their      short-liv'd fate;  Thine attire of past years to lay aside thou chang'st, a Taoist dress      to don;  How sad, alas! of a reputed house and noble kindred the scion,  Alone, behold! she sleeps under a glimmering light, an old idol for      mate.
Next in order came a hill of ice, on which stood a hen-phoenix, whileunder it was this motto:
  When time ends, sure coincidence, the phoenix doth alight;  The talents of this human form all know and living see,  For first to yield she kens, then to control, and third genial to be;  But sad to say, things in Chin Ling are in more sorry plight.
This was succeeded by a representation of a desolate village, and adreary inn. A pretty girl sat in there, spinning thread. These were thesentiments affixed below:
  When riches will have flown will honours then avail?  When ruin breaks your home, e'en relatives will fail!  But sudden through the aid extended to Dame Liu,  A friend in need fortune will make to rise for you.
Following these verses, was drawn a pot of Orchids, by the side ofwhich, was a beautiful maiden in a phoenix-crown and cloudy mantle(bridal dress); and to this picture was appended this device:
  What time spring wanes, then fades the bloom of peach as well as plum!  Who ever can like a pot of the olea be winsome!  With ice thy purity will vie, vain their envy will be!  In vain a laughing-stock people will try to make of thee.
At the end of this poetical device, came the representation of a loftyedifice, on which was a beauteous girl, suspending herself on a beam tocommit suicide; with this verse:
  Love high as heav'n, love ocean-wide, thy lovely form will don;  What time love will encounter love, license must rise wanton;  Why hold that all impiety in Jung doth find its spring,  The source of trouble, verily, is centred most in Ning.
Pao-y� was still bent upon prosecuting his perusal, when the Fairyperceiving that his intellect was eminent and bright, and his naturaltalents quickwitted, and apprehending lest the decrees of heaven shouldbe divulged, hastily closed the Book of Record, and addressed herself toPao-y�. "Come along with me," she said smiling, "and see some wonderfulscenery. What's the need of staying here and beating this gourd ofennui?"
In a dazed state, Pao-y� listlessly discarded the record, and againfollowed in the footsteps of the Fairy. On their arrival at the back, hesaw carnation porti�res, and embroidered curtains, ornamented pillars,and carved eaves. But no words can adequately give an idea of thevermilion apartments glistening with splendour, of the floors garnishedwith gold, of the snow reflecting lustrous windows, of the palatialmansions made of gems. He also saw fairyland flowers, beautiful andfragrant, and extraordinary vegetation, full of perfume. The spot wasindeed elysian.
He again heard the Fairy observe with a smiling face: "Come out all ofyou at once and greet the honoured guest!"
These words were scarcely completed, when he espied fairies walk out ofthe mansion, all of whom were, with their dangling lotus sleeves, andtheir fluttering feather habiliments, as comely as spring flowers, andas winsome as the autumn moon. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-y�,they all, with one voice, resentfully reproached the Monitory VisionFairy. "Ignorant as to who the honoured guest could be," they argued,"we hastened to come out to offer our greetings simply because you,elder sister, had told us that, on this day, and at this very time,there would be sure to come on a visit, the spirit of the younger sisterof Chiang Chu. That's the reason why we've been waiting for ever solong; and now why do you, in lieu of her, introduce this vile object tocontaminate the confines of pure and spotless maidens?"
As soon as Pao-y� heard these remarks, he was forthwith plunged in sucha state of consternation that he would have retired, but he found itimpossible to do so. In fact, he felt the consciousness of the foulnessand corruption of his own nature quite intolerable. The Monitory VisionFairy promptly took Pao-y�'s hand in her own, and turning towards heryounger sisters, smiled and explained: "You, and all of you, are notaware of the why and wherefore. To-day I did mean to have gone to theJung mansion to fetch Chiang Chu, but as I went by the Ning mansion, Iunexpectedly came across the ghosts of the two dukes of Jung and Ning,who addressed me in this wise: 'Our family has, since the dynastyestablished itself on the Throne, enjoyed merit and fame, which pervadedmany ages, and riches and honours transmitted from generation togeneration. One hundred years have already elapsed, but this goodfortune has now waned, and this propitious luck is exhausted; so much sothat they could not be retrieved! Our sons and grandsons may be many,but there is no one among them who has the means to continue the familyestate, with the exception of our kindred grandson, Pao-y� alone, who,though perverse in disposition and wayward by nature, is neverthelessintelligent and quick-witted and qualified in a measure to give effectto our hopes. But alas! the good fortune of our family is entirelydecayed, so that we fear there is no person to incite him to enter theright way! Fortunately you worthy fairy come at an unexpected moment,and we venture to trust that you will, above all things, warn himagainst the foolish indulgence of inordinate desire, lasciviousaffections and other such things, in the hope that he may, at yourinstigation, be able to escape the snares of those girls who will allurehim with their blandishments, and to enter on the right track; and wetwo brothers will be ever grateful.'
"On language such as this being addressed to me, my feelings ofcommiseration naturally burst forth; and I brought him here, and badehim, first of all, carefully peruse the records of the whole lives ofthe maidens in his family, belonging to the three grades, the upper,middle and lower, but as he has not yet fathomed the import, I haveconsequently led him into this place to experience the vision ofdrinking, eating, singing and licentious love, in the hope, there is nosaying, of his at length attaining that perception."
Having concluded these remarks, she led Pao-y� by the hand into theapartment, where he felt a whiff of subtle fragrance, but what it wasthat reached his nostrils he could not tell.
To Pao-y�'s eager and incessant inquiries, the Fairy made reply with asardonic smile. "This perfume," she said, "is not to be found in theworld, and how could you discern what it is? This is made of the essenceof the first sprouts of rare herbs, growing on all hills of fame andplaces of superior excellence, admixed with the oil of every species ofsplendid shrubs in precious groves, and is called the marrow ofConglomerated Fragrance."
At these words Pao-y� was, of course, full of no other feeling thanwonder.
The whole party advanced and took their seats, and a young maidservantpresented tea, which Pao-y� found of pure aroma, of excellent flavourand of no ordinary kind. "What is the name of this tea?" he thereforeasked; upon which the Fairy explained. "This tea," she added,"originates from the Hills of Emitted Spring and the Valley of DroopingFragrance, and is, besides, brewed in the night dew, found on spiritualplants and divine leaves. The name of this tea is 'one thousand red inone hole.'"
At these words Pao-y� nodded his head, and extolled its qualities.Espying in the room lutes, with jasper mountings, and tripods, inlaidwith gems, antique paintings, and new poetical works, which were to beseen everywhere, he felt more than ever in a high state of delight.Below the windows, were also shreds of velvet sputtered about and atoilet case stained with the traces of time and smudged with cosmetic;while on the partition wall was likewise suspended a pair of scrolls,with the inscription:
  A lonesome, small, ethereal, beauteous nook!  What help is there, but Heaven's will to brook?
Pao-y� having completed his inspection felt full of admiration, andproceeded to ascertain the names and surnames of the Fairies. One wascalled the Fairy of Lustful Dreams; another "the High Ruler ofPropagated Passion;" the name of one was "the Golden Maiden ofPerpetuated Sorrow;" of another the "Intelligent Maiden of TransmittedHatred." (In fact,) the respective Taoist appellations were not of oneand the same kind.
In a short while, young maid-servants came in and laid the table, putthe chairs in their places, and spread out wines and eatables. Therewere actually crystal tankards overflowing with luscious wines, andamber glasses full to the brim with pearly strong liquors. But stillless need is there to give any further details about the sumptuousnessof the refreshments.
Pao-y� found it difficult, on account of the unusual purity of thebouquet of the wine, to again restrain himself from making inquiriesabout it.
"This wine," observed the Monitory Dream Fairy, "is made of the twigs ofhundreds of flowers, and the juice of ten thousands of trees, with theaddition of must composed of unicorn marrow, and yeast prepared withphoenix milk. Hence the name of 'Ten thousand Beauties in one Cup' wasgiven to it."
Pao-y� sang its incessant praise, and, while he sipped his wine, twelvedancing girls came forward, and requested to be told what songs theywere to sing.
"Take," suggested the Fairy, "the newly-composed Twelve Sections of theDream of the Red Chamber, and sing them."
The singing girls signified their obedience, and forthwith they lightlyclapped the castagnettes and gently thrummed the virginals. These werethe words which they were heard to sing:
  At the time of the opening of the heavens and the laying out of the      earth chaos prevailed.
They had just sung this one line when the Fairy exclaimed: "This balladis unlike the ballads written in the dusty world whose purport is tohand down remarkable events, in which the distinction of scholars,girls, old men and women, and fools is essential, and in which arefurthermore introduced the lyrics of the Southern and Northern Palaces.These fairy songs consist either of elegaic effusions on some person orimpressions of some occurrence or other, and are impromptu songs readilyset to the music of wind or string instruments, so that any one who isnot cognisant of their gist cannot appreciate the beauties contained inthem. So you are not likely, I fear, to understand this lyric with anyclearness; and unless you first peruse the text and then listen to theballad, you will, instead of pleasure, feel as if you were chewing wax(devoid of any zest)."
After these remarks, she turned her head round, and directed a youngmaid-servant to fetch the text of the Dream of the Red Chamber, whichshe handed to Pao-y�, who took it over; and as he followed the wordswith his eyes, with his ears he listened to the strains of this song:
Preface of the Bream of the Red Chamber.--When the Heavens were openedand earth was laid out chaos prevailed! What was the germ of love? Itarises entirely from the strength of licentious love.
What day, by the will of heaven, I felt wounded at heart, and what timeI was at leisure, I made an attempt to disburden my sad heart; and withthis object in view I indited this Dream of the Bed Chamber, on thesubject of a disconsolate gold trinket and an unfortunate piece of jade.
Waste of a whole Lifetime. All maintain that the match between gold andjade will be happy. All I can think of is the solemn oath contracted indays gone by by the plant and stone! Vain will I gaze upon the snow,Hs�eh, [Pao-ch'ai], pure as crystal and lustrous like a gem of theeminent priest living among the hills! Never will I forget the noiselessFairy Grove, Lin [Tai-y�], beyond the confines of the mortal world!Alas! now only have I come to believe that human happiness isincomplete; and that a couple may be bound by the ties of wedlock forlife, but that after all their hearts are not easy to lull intocontentment.
Vain knitting of the brows. The one is a spirit flower of Fairyland; theother is a beautiful jade without a blemish. Do you maintain that theirunion will not be remarkable? Why how then is it that he has come tomeet her again in this existence? If the union will you say, be strange,how is it then that their love affair will be but empty words? The onein her loneliness will give way to useless sighs. The other in vain willyearn and crave. The one will be like the reflection of the moon inwater; the other like a flower reflected in a mirror. Consider, how manydrops of tears can there be in the eyes? and how could they continue todrop from autumn to winter and from spring to flow till summer time?
But to come to Pao-y�. After he had heard these ballads, so diffuse andvague, he failed to see any point of beauty in them; but the plaintivemelody of the sound was nevertheless sufficient to drive away his spiritand exhilarate his soul. Hence it was that he did not make any inquiriesabout the arguments, and that he did not ask about the matter treated,but simply making these ballads the means for the time being ofdispelling melancholy, he therefore went on with the perusal of whatcame below.
Despicable Spirit of Death! You will be rejoicing that glory is at itsheight when hateful death will come once again, and with eyes wide withhorror, you will discard all things, and dimly and softly the fragrantspirit will waste and dissolve! You will yearn for native home, butdistant will be the way, and lofty the mountains. Hence it is that youwill betake yourself in search of father and mother, while they lieunder the influence of a dream, and hold discourse with them. "Yourchild," you will say, "has already trodden the path of death! Oh myparents, it behoves you to speedily retrace your steps and make goodyour escape!"
Separated from Relatives. You will speed on a journey of three thousandli at the mercy of wind and rain, and tear yourself from all your familyties and your native home! Your fears will be lest anguish should do anyharm to your parents in their failing years! "Father and mother," youwill bid them, "do not think with any anxiety of your child. From agespast poverty as well as success have both had a fixed destiny; and is itlikely that separation and reunion are not subject to predestination?Though we may now be far apart in two different places, we must each ofus try and preserve good cheer. Your abject child has, it is true, gonefrom home, but abstain from distressing yourselves on her account!"
Sorrow in the midst of Joy. While wrapped as yet in swaddling clothes,father and mother, both alas! will depart, and dwell though you will inthat mass of gauze, who is there who will know how to spoil you with anyfond attention? Born you will be fortunately with ample moral courage,and high-minded and boundless resources, for your parents will not have,in the least, their child's secret feelings at heart! You will be like amoon appearing to view when the rain holds up, shedding its rays uponthe Jade Hall; or a gentle breeze (wafting its breath upon it). Weddedto a husband, fairy like fair and accomplished, you will enjoy ahappiness enduring as the earth and perennial as the Heavens! and youwill be the means of snapping asunder the bitter fate of your youth!But, after all, the clouds will scatter in Kao T'ang and the waters ofthe Hsiang river will get parched! This is the inevitable destiny ofdissolution and continuance which prevails in the mortal world, and whatneed is there to indulge in useless grief?
Intolerable to the world. Your figure will be as winsome as an oleafragrans; your talents as ample as those of a Fairy! You will by naturebe so haughty that of the whole human race few will be like you! Youwill look upon a meat diet as one of dirt, and treat splendour as coarseand loathsome! And yet you will not be aware that your high notions willbring upon you the excessive hatred of man! You will be very eager inyour desire after chastity, but the human race will despise you! Alas,you will wax old in that antique temple hall under a faint light, whereyou will waste ungrateful for beauty, looks and freshness! But after allyou will still be worldly, corrupt and unmindful of your vows; just likea spotless white jade you will be whose fate is to fall into the mire!And what need will there be for the grandson of a prince or the son of aduke to deplore that his will not be the good fortune (of winning youraffections)?
The Voluptuary. You will resemble a wolf in the mountains! a savagebeast devoid of all human feeling! Regardless in every way of theobligations of days gone by, your sole pleasure will be in theindulgence of haughtiness, extravagance, licentiousness and dissolutehabits! You will be inordinate in your conjugal affections, and lookdown upon the beautiful charms of the child of a marquis, as if theywere cat-tail rush or willow; trampling upon the honourable daughter ofa ducal mansion, as if she were one of the common herd. Pitiful to say,the fragrant spirit and beauteous ghost will in a year softly and gentlypass away!
The Perception that all things are transient like flowers. You will looklightly upon the three springs and regard the blush of the peach and thegreen of the willow as of no avail. You will beat out the fire ofsplendour, and treat solitary retirement as genial! What is it that yousay about the delicate peaches in the heavens (marriage) beingexcellent, and the petals of the almond in the clouds being plentiful(children)? Let him who has after all seen one of them, (really a mortalbeing) go safely through the autumn, (wade safely through old age),behold the people in the white Poplar village groan and sigh; and thespirits under the green maple whine and moan! Still more wide in expansethan even the heavens is the dead vegetation which covers the graves!The moral is this, that the burden of man is poverty one day andaffluence another; that bloom in spring, and decay in autumn, constitutethe doom of vegetable life! In the same way, this calamity of birth andthe visitation of death, who is able to escape? But I have heard it saidthat there grows in the western quarter a tree called the P'o So(Patient Bearing) which bears the fruit of Immortal life!
The bane of Intelligence. Yours will be the power to estimate, in athorough manner, the real motives of all things, as yours will beintelligence of an excessive degree; but instead (of reaping anybenefit) you will cast the die of your own existence! The heart of yourprevious life is already reduced to atoms, and when you shall have died,your nature will have been intelligent to no purpose! Your home will bein easy circumstances; your family will enjoy comforts; but yourconnexions will, at length, fall a prey to death, and the inmates ofyour family scatter, each one of you speeding in a different direction,making room for others! In vain, you will have harassed your mind withcankering thoughts for half a lifetime; for it will be just as if youhad gone through the confused mazes of a dream on the third watch!Sudden a crash (will be heard) like the fall of a spacious palace, and adusky gloominess (will supervene) such as is caused by a lamp about tospend itself! Alas! a spell of happiness will be suddenly (dispelled by)adversity! Woe is man in the world! for his ultimate doom is difficultto determine!
Leave behind a residue of happiness! Hand down an excess of happiness;hand down an excess of happiness! Unexpectedly you will come across abenefactor! Fortunate enough your mother, your own mother, will havelaid by a store of virtue and secret meritorious actions! My advice toyou, mankind, is to relieve the destitute and succour the distressed! Donot resemble those who will harp after lucre and show themselvesunmindful of the ties of relationship: that wolflike maternal uncle ofyours and that impostor of a brother! True it is that addition andsubtraction, increase and decrease, (reward and punishment,) rest in thehands of Heaven above!
Splendour at last. Loving affection in a mirror will be still moreephemeral than fame in a dream. That fine splendour will fleet how soon!Make no further allusion to embroidered curtain, to bridal coverlet; forthough you may come to wear on your head a pearl-laden coronet, and, onyour person, a jacket ornamented with phoenixes, yours will notnevertheless be the means to atone for the short life (of your husband)!Though the saying is that mankind should not have, in their old age, theburden of poverty to bear, yet it is also essential that a store ofbenevolent deeds should be laid up for the benefit of sons andgrandsons! (Your son) may come to be dignified in appearance and wear onhis head the official tassel, and on his chest may be suspended the goldseal resplendent in lustre; he may be imposing in his majesty, and hemay rise high in status and emoluments, but the dark and dreary waywhich leads to death is short! Are the generals and ministers who havebeen from ages of old still in the flesh, forsooth? They exist only in afutile name handed down to posterity to reverence!
Death ensues when things propitious reign! Upon the ornamented beam willsettle at the close of spring the fragrant dust! Your recklessindulgence of licentious love and your naturally moonlike face will soonbe the source of the ruin of a family. The decadence of the familyestate will emanate entirely from Ching; while the wane of the familyaffairs will be entirely attributable to the fault of Ning! Licentiouslove will be the main reason of the long-standing grudge.
The flying birds each perch upon the trees! The family estates of thosein official positions will fade! The gold and silver of the rich andhonoured will be scattered! those who will have conferred benefit will,even in death, find the means of escape! those devoid of human feelingswill reap manifest retribution! Those indebted for a life will make, indue time, payment with their lives; those indebted for tears havealready (gone) to exhaust their tears! Mutual injuries will be revengedin no light manner! Separation and reunion will both alike be determinedby predestination! You wish to know why your life will be short; lookinto your previous existence! Verily, riches and honours, which willcome with old age, will likewise be a question of chance! Those who willhold the world in light esteem will retire within the gate ofabstraction; while those who will be allured by enticement will haveforfeited their lives (The Chia family will fulfil its destiny) assurely as birds take to the trees after they have exhausted all they hadto eat, and which as they drop down will pile up a hoary, vast and loftyheap of dust, (leaving) indeed a void behind!
When the maidens had finished the ballads, they went on to sing the"Supplementary Record;" but the Monitory Vision Fairy, perceiving thetotal absence of any interest in Pao-y�, heaved a sigh. "You sillybrat!" she exclaimed. "What! haven't you, even now, attainedperception!"
"There's no need for you to go on singing," speedily observed Pao-y�, ashe interrupted the singing maidens; and feeling drowsy and dull, hepleaded being under the effects of wine, and begged to be allowed to liedown.
The Fairy then gave orders to clear away the remains of the feast, andescorted Pao-y� to a suite of female apartments, where the splendour ofsuch objects as were laid out was a thing which he had not hithertoseen. But what evoked in him wonder still more intense, was the sight,at an early period, of a girl seated in the room, who, in the freshnessof her beauty and winsomeness of her charms, bore some resemblance toPao-ch'ai, while, in elegance and comeliness, on the other hand, toTai-yu.
While he was plunged in a state of perplexity, the Fairy suddenlyremarked: "All those female apartments and ladies' chambers in so manywealthy and honourable families in the world are, without exception,polluted by voluptuous opulent puppets and by all that bevy ofprofligate girls. But still more despicable are those from old till nownumberless dissolute rou�s, one and all of whom maintain that libidinousaffections do not constitute lewdness; and who try, further, to provethat licentious love is not tantamount to lewdness. But all thesearguments are mere apologies for their shortcomings, and a screen fortheir pollutions; for if libidinous affection be lewdness, still moredoes the perception of licentious love constitute lewdness. Hence it isthat the indulgence of sensuality and the gratification of licentiousaffection originate entirely from a relish of lust, as well as from ahankering after licentious love. Lo you, who are the object of my love,are the most lewd being under the heavens from remote ages to thepresent time!"
Pao-y� was quite dumbstruck by what he heard, and hastily smiling, hesaid by way of reply: "My Fairy labours under a misapprehension. Simplybecause of my reluctance to read my books my parents have, on repeatedoccasions, extended to me injunction and reprimand, and would I have thecourage to go so far as to rashly plunge in lewd habits? Besides, I amstill young in years, and have no notion what is implied by lewdness!"
"Not so!" exclaimed the Fairy; "lewdness, although one thing inprinciple is, as far as meaning goes, subject to differentconstructions; as is exemplified by those in the world whose heart isset upon lewdness. Some delight solely in faces and figures; others findinsatiable pleasure in singing and dancing; some in dalliance andraillery; others in the incessant indulgence of their lusts; and theseregret that all the beautiful maidens under the heavens cannot ministerto their short-lived pleasure. These several kinds of persons are foulobjects steeped skin and all in lewdness. The lustful love, forinstance, which has sprung to life and taken root in your naturalaffections, I and such as myself extend to it the character of anabstract lewdness; but abstract lewdness can be grasped by the mind, butcannot be transmitted by the mouth; can be fathomed by the spirit, butcannot be divulged in words. As you now are imbued with this desire onlyin the abstract, you are certainly well fit to be a trustworthy friendin (Fairyland) inner apartments, but, on the path of the mortal world,you will inevitably be misconstrued and defamed; every mouth willridicule you; every eye will look down upon you with contempt. Aftermeeting recently your worthy ancestors, the two Dukes of Ning and Jung,who opened their hearts and made their wishes known to me with suchfervour, (but I will not have you solely on account of the splendour ofour inner apartments look down despisingly upon the path of the world),I consequently led you along, my son, and inebriated you with lusciouswines, steeped you in spiritual tea, and admonished you with excellentsongs, bringing also here a young sister of mine, whose infant name isChien Mei, and her style K'o Ching, to be given to you as your weddedwife. To-night, the time will be propitious and suitable for theimmediate consummation of the union, with the express object of lettingyou have a certain insight into the fact that if the condition of theabode of spirits within the confines of Fairyland be still so(imperfect), how much the more so should be the nature of the affectionswhich prevail in the dusty world; with the intent that from this timeforth you should positively break loose from bondage, perceive and amendyour former disposition, devote your attention to the works of Confuciusand Mencius, and set your steady purpose upon the principles ofmorality."
Having ended these remarks, she initiated him into the mysteries oflicentious love, and, pushing Pao-y� into the room, she closed the door,and took her departure all alone. Pao-y� in a dazed state complied withthe admonitions given him by the Fairy, and the natural result was, ofcourse, a violent flirtation, the circumstances of which it would beimpossible to recount.
When the next day came, he was by that time so attached to her by tiesof tender love and their conversation was so gentle and full of charmthat he could not brook to part from K'o Ching. Hand-in-hand, the two ofthem therefore, went out for a stroll, when they unexpectedly reached aplace, where nothing else met their gaze than thorns and brambles, whichcovered the ground, and a wolf and a tiger walking side by side. Beforethem stretched the course of a black stream, which obstructed theirprogress; and over this stream there was, what is more, no bridge toenable one to cross it.
While they were exercising their minds with perplexity, they suddenlyespied the Fairy coming from the back in pursuit of them. "Desist atonce," she exclaimed, "from making any advance into the stream; it isurgent that you should, with all speed, turn your faces round!"
Pao-y� lost no time in standing still. "What is this place?" heinquired.
"This is the Ford of Enticement," explained the Fairy. "Its depth is tenthousand chang; its breadth is a thousand li; in its stream there are noboats or paddles by means of which to effect a passage. There is simplya raft, of which Mu Chu-shih directs the rudder, and which Hui Shih chenpunts with the poles. They receive no compensation in the shape of goldor silver, but when they come across any one whose destiny it is tocross, they ferry him over. You now have by accident strolled as far ashere, and had you fallen into the stream you would have rendered quiteuseless the advice and admonition which I previously gave you."
These words were scarcely concluded, when suddenly was heard from themidst of the Ford of Enticement, a sound like unto a peal of thunder,whereupon a whole crowd of gobblins and sea-urchins laid hands uponPao-y� and dragged him down.
This so filled Pao-y� with consternation that he fell into aperspiration as profuse as rain, and he simultaneously broke forth andshouted, "Rescue me, K'o Ching!"
These cries so terrified Hsi Jen and the other waiting-maids, that theyrushed forward, and taking Pao-y� in their arms, "Don't be afraid,Pao-y�," they said, "we are here."
But we must observe that Mrs. Ch'in was just inside the apartment in theact of recommending the young waiting-maids to be mindful that the catsand dogs did not start a fight, when she unawares heard Pao-y�, in hisdream, call her by her infant name. In a melancholy mood she thereforecommuned within herself, "As far as my infant name goes, there is, inthis establishment, no one who has any idea what it is, and how is itthat he has come to know it, and that he utters it in his dream?" Andshe was at this period unable to fathom the reason. But, reader, listento the explanations given in the chapter which follows.

CHAPTER VI.
  Chia Pao-y� reaps his first experience in licentious love.  Old Goody Liu pays a visit to the Jung Kuo Mansion.
Mrs. Ch'in, to resume our narrative, upon hearing Pao-y� call her in hisdream by her infant name, was at heart very exercised, but she did nothowever feel at liberty to make any minute inquiry.
Pao-y� was, at this time, in such a dazed state, as if he had lostsomething, and the servants promptly gave him a decoction of lungngan.After he had taken a few sips, he forthwith rose and tidied his clothes.
Hsi Jen put out her hand to fasten the band of his garment, and as soonas she did so, and it came in contact with his person, it felt so icycold to the touch, covered as it was all over with perspiration, thatshe speedily withdrew her hand in utter surprise.
"What's the matter with you?" she exclaimed.
A blush suffused Pao-y�'s face, and he took Hsi Jen's hand in a tightgrip. Hsi Jen was a girl with all her wits about her; she was besides acouple of years older than Pao-y� and had recently come to knowsomething of the world, so that at the sight of his state, she to agreat extent readily accounted for the reason in her heart. From modestshame, she unconsciously became purple in the face, and not venturing toask another question she continued adjusting his clothes. This taskaccomplished, she followed him over to old lady Chia's apartments; andafter a hurry-scurry meal, they came back to this side, and Hsi Jenavailed herself of the absence of the nurses and waiting-maids to handPao-y� another garment to change.
"Please, dear Hsi Jen, don't tell any one," entreated Pao-y�, withconcealed shame.
"What did you dream of?" inquired Hsi Jen, smiling, as she tried tostifle her blushes, "and whence comes all this perspiration?"
"It's a long story," said Pao-y�, "which only a few words will notsuffice to explain."
He accordingly recounted minutely, for her benefit, the subject of hisdream. When he came to where the Fairy had explained to him themysteries of love, Hsi Jen was overpowered with modesty and covered herface with her hands; and as she bent down, she gave way to a fit oflaughter. Pao-y� had always been fond of Hsi Jen, on account of hergentleness, pretty looks and graceful and elegant manner, and heforthwith expounded to her all the mysteries he had been taught by theFairy.
Hsi Jen was, of course, well aware that dowager lady Chia had given herover to Pao-y�, so that her present behaviour was likewise notransgression. And subsequently she secretly attempted with Pao-y� aviolent flirtation, and lucky enough no one broke in upon them duringtheir t�te-�-t�te. From this date, Pao-y� treated Hsi Jen with specialregard, far more than he showed to the other girls, while Hsi Jenherself was still more demonstrative in her attentions to Pao-y�. Butfor a time we will make no further remark about them.
As regards the household of the Jung mansion, the inmates may, on addingup the total number, not have been found many; yet, counting the high aswell as the low, there were three hundred persons and more. Theiraffairs may not have been very numerous, still there were, every day,ten and twenty matters to settle; in fact, the household resembled, inevery way, ravelled hemp, devoid even of a clue-end, which could be usedas an introduction.
Just as we were considering what matter and what person it would be bestto begin writing of, by a lucky coincidence suddenly from a distance ofa thousand li, a person small and insignificant as a grain of mustardseed happened, on account of her distant relationship with the Jungfamily, to come on this very day to the Jung mansion on a visit. Weshall therefore readily commence by speaking of this family, as it afterall affords an excellent clue for a beginning.
The surname of this mean and humble family was in point of fact Wang.They were natives of this district. Their ancestor had filled a minoroffice in the capital, and had, in years gone by, been acquainted withlady Feng's grandfather, that is madame Wang's father. Being covetous ofthe influence and affluence of the Wang family, he consequently joinedancestors with them, and was recognised by them as a nephew.
At that time, there were only madame Wang's eldest brother, that is ladyFeng's father, and madame Wang herself, who knew anything of thesedistant relations, from the fact of having followed their parents to thecapital. The rest of the family had one and all no idea about them.
This ancestor had, at this date, been dead long ago, leaving only oneson called Wang Ch'eng. As the family estate was in a state of ruin, heonce more moved outside the city walls and settled down in his nativevillage. Wang Ch'eng also died soon after his father, leaving a son,known in his infancy as Kou Erh, who married a Miss Liu, by whom he hada son called by the infant name of Pan Erh, as well as a daughter,Ch'ing Erh. His family consisted of four, and he earned a living fromfarming.
As Kou Erh was always busy with something or other during the day andhis wife, dame Liu, on the other hand, drew the water, pounded the riceand attended to all the other domestic concerns, the brother and sister,Ch'ing Erh and Pan Erh, the two of them, had no one to look after them.(Hence it was that) Kou Erh brought over his mother-in-law, old goodyLiu, to live with them.
This goody Liu was an old widow, with a good deal of experience. She hadbesides no son round her knees, so that she was dependent for hermaintenance on a couple of acres of poor land, with the result that whenher son-in-law received her in his home, she naturally was ever willingto exert heart and mind to help her daughter and her son-in-law to earntheir living.
This year, the autumn had come to an end, winter had commenced, and theweather had begun to be quite cold. No provision had been made in thehousehold for the winter months, and Kou Erh was, inevitably,exceedingly exercised in his heart. Having had several cups of wine todispel his distress, he sat at home and tried to seize upon every trifleto give vent to his displeasure. His wife had not the courage to forceherself in his way, and hence goody Liu it was who encouraged him, asshe could not bear to see the state of the domestic affairs.
"Don't pull me up for talking too much," she said; "but who of uscountry people isn't honest and open-hearted? As the size of the bowl wehold, so is the quantity of the rice we eat. In your young days, youwere dependent on the support of your old father, so that eating anddrinking became quite a habit with you; that's how, at the present time,your resources are quite uncertain; when you had money, you lookedahead, and didn't mind behind; and now that you have no money, youblindly fly into huffs. A fine fellow and a capital hero you have made!Living though we now be away from the capital, we are after all at thefeet of the Emperor; this city of Ch'ang Ngan is strewn all over withmoney, but the pity is that there's no one able to go and fetch it away;and it's no use your staying at home and kicking your feet about."
"All you old lady know," rejoined Kou Erh, after he had heard what shehad to say, "is to sit on the couch and talk trash! Is it likely youwould have me go and play the robber?"
"Who tells you to become a robber?" asked goody Liu. "But it would bewell, after all, that we should put our heads together and devise somemeans; for otherwise, is the money, pray, able of itself to run into ourhouse?"
"Had there been a way," observed Kou Erh, smiling sarcastically, "wouldI have waited up to this moment? I have besides no revenue collectors asrelatives, or friends in official positions; and what way could wedevise? 'But even had I any, they wouldn't be likely, I fear, to pay anyheed to such as ourselves!"
"That, too, doesn't follow," remarked goody Liu; "the planning ofaffairs rests with man, but the accomplishment of them rests withHeaven. After we have laid our plans, we may, who can say, by relying onthe sustenance of the gods, find some favourable occasion. Leave it tome, I'll try and devise some lucky chance for you people! In years goneby, you joined ancestors with the Wang family of Chin Ling, and twentyyears back, they treated you with consideration; but of late, you'vebeen so high and mighty, and not condescended to go and bow to them,that an estrangement has arisen. I remember how in years gone by, I andmy daughter paid them a visit. The second daughter of the family wasreally so pleasant and knew so well how to treat people with kindness,and without in fact any high airs! She's at present the wife of Mr.Chia, the second son of the Jung Kuo mansion; and I hear people say thatnow that she's advanced in years, she's still more considerate to thepoor, regardful of the old, and very fond of preparing vegetable foodfor the bonzes and performing charitable deeds. The head of the Wangmansion has, it is true, been raised to some office on the frontier, butI hope that this lady Secunda will anyhow notice us. How is it then thatyou don't find your way as far as there; for she may possibly rememberold times, and some good may, no one can say, come of it? I only wishthat she would display some of her kind-heartedness, and pluck one hairfrom her person which would be, yea thicker than our waist."
"What you suggest, mother, is quite correct," interposed Mrs. Liu, KouErh's wife, who stood by and took up the conversation, "but with suchmouth and phiz as yours and mine, how could we present ourselves beforeher door? Why I fear that the man at her gate won't also like to go andannounce us! and we'd better not go and have our mouths slapped inpublic!"
Kou Erh, who would have thought it, prized highly both affluence andfame, so that when he heard these remarks, he forthwith began to feel atheart a little more at ease. When he furthermore heard what his wife hadto say, he at once caught up the word as he smiled.
"Old mother," he rejoined; "since that be your idea, and what's more,you have in days gone by seen this lady on one occasion, why shouldn'tyou, old lady, start to-morrow on a visit to her and first ascertain howthe wind blows!"
"Ai Ya!" exclaimed old Goody, "It may very well be said that themarquis' door is like the wide ocean! what sort of thing am I? why theservants of that family wouldn't even recognise me! even were I to go,it would be on a wild goose chase."
"No matter about that," observed Kou Erh; "I'll tell you a good way; youjust take along with you, your grandson, little Pan Erh, and go firstand call upon Chou Jui, who is attached to that household; and when onceyou've seen him, there will be some little chance. This Chou Jui, at onetime, was connected with my father in some affair or other, and we wereon excellent terms with him."
"That I too know," replied goody Liu, "but the thing is that you've hadno dealings with him for so long, that who knows how he's disposedtowards us now? this would be hard to say. Besides, you're a man, andwith a mouth and phiz like that of yours, you couldn't, on any account,go on this errand. My daughter is a young woman, and she too couldn'tvery well go and expose herself to public gaze. But by my sacrificingthis old face of mine, and by going and knocking it (against the wall)there may, after all, be some benefit and all of us might reap profit."
That very same evening, they laid their plans, and the next morningbefore the break of day, old goody Liu speedily got up, and havingperformed her toilette, she gave a few useful hints to Pan Erh; who,being a child of five or six years of age, was, when he heard that hewas to be taken into the city, at once so delighted that there wasnothing that he would not agree to.
Without further delay, goody Liu led off Pan Erh, and entered the city,and reaching the Ning Jung street, she came to the main entrance of theJung mansion, where, next to the marble lions, were to be seen a crowdof chairs and horses. Goody Liu could not however muster the courage togo by, but having shaken her clothes, and said a few more seasonablewords to Pan Erh, she subsequently squatted in front of the side gate,whence she could see a number of servants, swelling out their chests,pushing out their stomachs, gesticulating with their hands and kickingtheir feet about, while they were seated at the main entrance chatteringabout one thing and another.
Goody Liu felt constrained to edge herself forward. "Gentlemen," sheventured, "may happiness betide you!"
The whole company of servants scrutinised her for a time. "Where do youcome from?" they at length inquired.
"I've come to look up Mr. Chou, an attendant of my lady's," remarkedgoody Liu, as she forced a smile; "which of you, gentlemen, shall Itrouble to do me the favour of asking him to come out?"
The servants, after hearing what she had to say, paid, the whole numberof them, no heed to her; and it was after the lapse of a considerabletime that they suggested: "Go and wait at a distance, at the foot ofthat wall; and in a short while, the visitors, who are in their house,will be coming out."
Among the party of attendants was an old man, who interposed,
"Don't baffle her object," he expostulated; "why make a fool of her?"and turning to goody Liu: "This Mr. Chou," he said, "is gone south: hishouse is at the back row; his wife is anyhow at home; so go round thisway, until you reach the door, at the back street, where, if you willask about her, you will be on the right track."
Goody Liu, having expressed her thanks, forthwith went, leading Pan Erhby the hand, round to the back door, where she saw several pedlarsresting their burdens. There were also those who sold things to eat, andthose who sold playthings and toys; and besides these, twenty or thirtyboys bawled and shouted, making quite a noise.
Goody Liu readily caught hold of one of them. "I'd like to ask you justa word, my young friend," she observed; "there's a Mrs. Chou here; isshe at home?"
"Which Mrs. Chou?" inquired the boy; "we here have three Mrs. Chous; andthere are also two young married ladies of the name of Chou. What arethe duties of the one you want, I wonder ?"
"She's a waiting-woman of my lady," replied goody Liu.
"It's easy to get at her," added the boy; "just come along with me."
Leading the way for goody Liu into the backyard, they reached the wallof a court, when he pointed and said, "This is her house.--Mother Chou!"he went on to shout with alacrity; "there's an old lady who wants to seeyou."
Chou Jui's wife was at home, and with all haste she came out to greether visitor. "Who is it?" she asked.
Goody Liu advanced up to her. "How are you," she inquired, "Mrs. Chou?"
Mrs. Chou looked at her for some time before she at length smiled andreplied, "Old goody Liu, are you well? How many years is it since we'veseen each other; tell me, for I forget just now; but please come in andsit."
"You're a lady of rank," answered goody Liu smiling, as she walkedalong, "and do forget many things. How could you remember such asourselves?"
With these words still in her mouth, they had entered the house,whereupon Mrs. Chou ordered a hired waiting-maid to pour the tea. Whilethey were having their tea she remarked, "How Pan Erh has managed togrow!" and then went on to make inquiries on the subject of variousmatters, which had occurred after their separation.
"To-day," she also asked of goody Liu, "were you simply passing by? ordid you come with any express object?"
"I've come, the fact is, with an object!" promptly replied goody Liu;"(first of all) to see you, my dear sister-in-law; and, in the secondplace also, to inquire after my lady's health. If you could introduce meto see her for a while, it would be better; but if you can't, I mustreadily borrow your good offices, my sister-in-law, to convey mymessage."
Mr. Chou Jui's wife, after listening to these words, at once became to agreat extent aware of the object of her visit. Her husband had, however,in years gone by in his attempt to purchase some land, obtainedconsiderably the support of Kou Erh, so that when she, on this occasion,saw goody Liu in such a dilemma, she could not make up her mind torefuse her wish. Being in the second place keen upon making a display ofher own respectability, she therefore said smilingly:
"Old goody Liu, pray compose your mind! You've come from far off with apure heart and honest purpose, and how can I ever not show you the wayhow to see this living Buddha? Properly speaking, when people come andguests arrive, and verbal messages have to be given, these matters arenot any of my business, as we all here have each one kind of duties tocarry out. My husband has the special charge of the rents of land comingin, during the two seasons of spring and autumn, and when at leisure, hetakes the young gentlemen out of doors, and then his business is done.As for myself, I have to accompany my lady and young married ladies onanything connected with out-of-doors; but as you are a relative of mylady and have besides treated me as a high person and come to me forhelp, I'll, after all, break this custom and deliver your message.There's only one thing, however, and which you, old lady, don't know. Wehere are not what we were five years before. My lady now doesn't muchworry herself about anything; and it's entirely lady Secunda who looksafter the menage. But who do you presume is this lady Secunda? She's theniece of my lady, and the daughter of my master, the eldest maternaluncle of by-gone days. Her infant name was Feng Ko."
"Is it really she?" inquired promptly goody Liu, after this explanation."Isn't it strange? what I said about her years back has come out quitecorrect; but from all you say, shall I to-day be able to see her?"
"That goes without saying," replied Chou Jui's wife; "when any visitorscome now-a-days, it's always lady Feng who does the honours andentertains them, and it's better to-day that you should see her for awhile, for then you will not have walked all this way to no purpose."
"O mi to fu!" exclaimed old goody Liu; "I leave it entirely to yourconvenience, sister-in-law."
"What's that you're saying?" observed Chou Jui's wife. "The proverbsays: 'Our convenience is the convenience of others.' All I have to dois to just utter one word, and what trouble will that be to me."
Saying this, she bade the young waiting maid go to the side pavilion,and quietly ascertain whether, in her old ladyship's apartment, tablehad been laid.
The young waiting-maid went on this errand, and during this while, thetwo of them continued a conversation on certain irrelevant matters.
"This lady Feng," observed goody Liu, "can this year be no older thantwenty, and yet so talented as to manage such a household as this! thelike of her is not easy to find!"
"Hai! my dear old goody," said Chou Jui's wife, after listening to her,"it's not easy to explain; but this lady Feng, though young in years, isnevertheless, in the management of affairs, superior to any man. She hasnow excelled the others and developed the very features of a beautifulyoung woman. To say the least, she has ten thousand eyes in her heart,and were they willing to wager their mouths, why ten men gifted witheloquence couldn't even outdo her! But by and bye, when you've seen her,you'll know all about her! There's only this thing, she can't help beingrather too severe in her treatment of those below her."
While yet she spake, the young waiting-maid returned. "In her venerablelady's apartment," she reported, "repast has been spread, and alreadyfinished; lady Secunda is in madame Wang's chamber."
As soon as Chou Jui's wife heard this news, she speedily got up andpressed goody Liu to be off at once. "This is," she urged, "just thehour for her meal, and as she is free we had better first go and waitfor her; for were we to be even one step too late, a crowd of servantswill come with their reports, and it will then be difficult to speak toher; and after her siesta, she'll have still less time to herself."
As she passed these remarks, they all descended the couch together.Goody Liu adjusted their dresses, and, having impressed a few more wordsof advice on Pan Erh, they followed Chou Jui's wife through windingpassages to Chia Lien's house. They came in the first instance into theside pavilion, where Chou Jui's wife placed old goody Liu to wait alittle, while she herself went ahead, past the screen-wall and into theentrance of the court.
Hearing that lady Feng had not come out, she went in search of anelderly waiting-maid of lady Feng, P'ing Erh by name, who enjoyed herconfidence, to whom Chou Jui's wife first recounted from beginning toend the history of old goody Liu.
"She has come to-day," she went on to explain, "from a distance to payher obeisance. In days gone by, our lady used often to meet her, sothat, on this occasion, she can't but receive her; and this is why I'vebrought her in! I'll wait here for lady Feng to come down, and explaineverything to her; and I trust she'll not call me to task for officiousrudeness."
P'ing Erh, after hearing what she had to say, speedily devised the planof asking them to walk in, and to sit there pending (lady Feng'sarrival), when all would be right.
Chou Jui's wife thereupon went out and led them in. When they ascendedthe steps of the main apartment, a young waiting-maid raised a redwoollen porti�re, and as soon as they entered the hall, they smelt awhiff of perfume as it came wafted into their faces: what the scent wasthey could not discriminate; but their persons felt as if they wereamong the clouds.
The articles of furniture and ornaments in the whole room were all sobrilliant to the sight, and so vying in splendour that they made thehead to swim and the eyes to blink, and old goody Liu did nothing elsethe while than nod her head, smack her lips and invoke Buddha. Forthwithshe was led to the eastern side into the suite of apartments, where wasthe bedroom of Chia Lien's eldest daughter. P'ing Erh, who was standingby the edge of the stove-couch, cast a couple of glances at old goodyLiu, and felt constrained to inquire how she was, and to press her tohave a seat.
Goody Liu, noticing that P'ing Erh was entirely robed in silks, that shehad gold pins fixed in her hair, and silver ornaments in her coiffure,and that her countenance resembled a flower or the moon (in beauty),readily imagined her to be lady Feng, and was about to address her as mylady; but when she heard Mrs. Chou speak to her as Miss P'ing, and P'ingErh promptly address Chou Jui's wife as Mrs. Chou, she eventually becameaware that she could be no more than a waiting-maid of a certainrespectability.
She at once pressed old goody Liu and Pan Erh to take a seat on thestove-couch. P'ing Erh and Chou Jui's wife sat face to face, on theedges of the couch. The waiting-maids brought the tea. After they hadpartaken of it, old goody Liu could hear nothing but a "lo tang, lotang" noise, resembling very much the sound of a bolting frame winnowingflour, and she could not resist looking now to the East, and now to theWest. Suddenly in the great Hall, she espied, suspended on a pillar, abox at the bottom of which hung something like the weight of a balance,which incessantly wagged to and fro.
"What can this thing be?" communed goody Liu in her heart, "What can beits use?" While she was aghast, she unexpectedly heard a sound of "tang"like the sound of a golden bell or copper cymbal, which gave her quite astart. In a twinkle of the eyes followed eight or nine consecutivestrokes; and she was bent upon inquiring what it was, when she caughtsight of several waiting-maids enter in a confused crowd. "Our lady hascome down!" they announced.
P'�ng Erh, together with Chou Jui's wife, rose with all haste. "Oldgoody Liu," they urged, "do sit down and wait till it's time, when we'llcome and ask you in."
Saying this, they went out to meet lady Feng.
Old goody Liu, with suppressed voice and ear intent, waited in perfectsilence. She heard at a distance the voices of some people laughing,whereupon about ten or twenty women, with rustling clothes andpetticoats, made their entrance, one by one, into the hall, and thenceinto the room on the other quarter. She also detected two or threewomen, with red-lacquered boxes in their hands, come over on this partand remain in waiting.
"Get the repast ready!" she heard some one from the offside say.
The servants gradually dispersed and went out; and there only remainedin attendance a few of them to bring in the courses. For a long time,not so much as the caw of a crow could be heard, when she unexpectedlyperceived two servants carry in a couch-table, and lay it on this sideof the divan. Upon this table were placed bowls and plates, in properorder replete, as usual, with fish and meats; but of these only a fewkinds were slightly touched.
As soon as Pan Erh perceived (all these delicacies), he set up such anoise, and would have some meat to eat, but goody Liu administered tohim such a slap, that he had to keep away.
Suddenly, she saw Mrs. Chou approach, full of smiles, and as she wavedher hand, she called her. Goody Liu understood her meaning, and at oncepulling Pan Erh off the couch, she proceeded to the centre of the Hall;and after Mrs. Chou had whispered to her again for a while, they came atlength with slow step into the room on this side, where they saw on theoutside of the door, suspended by brass hooks, a deep red flowered softporti�re. Below the window, on the southern side, was a stove-couch, andon this couch was spread a crimson carpet. Leaning against the woodenpartition wall, on the east side, stood a chain-embroidered back-cushionand a reclining pillow. There was also spread a large watered satinsitting cushion with a gold embroidered centre, and on the side stoodcuspidores made of silver.
Lady Feng, when at home, usually wore on her head a front-piece of darkmartin � la Chao Ch�n, surrounded with tassels of strung pearls. She hadon a robe of peach-red flowered satin, a short pelisse of slate-bluestiff silk, lined with squirrel, and a jupe of deep red foreign crepe,lined with ermine. Resplendent with pearl-powder and with cosmetics, shesat in there, stately and majestic, with a small brass poker in herhands, with which she was stirring the ashes of the hand-stove. P'ingErh stood by the side of the couch, holding a very small lacqueredtea-tray. In this tray was a small tea-cup with a cover. Lady Fengneither took any tea, nor did she raise her head, but was intent uponstirring the ashes of the hand-stove.
"How is it you haven't yet asked her to come in?" she slowly inquired;and as she spake, she turned herself round and was about to ask for sometea, when she perceived that Mrs. Chou had already introduced the twopersons and that they were standing in front of her.
She forthwith pretended to rise, but did not actually get up, and with aface radiant with smiles, she ascertained about their health, afterwhich she went in to chide Chou Jui's wife. "Why didn't you tell me theyhad come before?" she said.
Old goody Liu was already by this time prostrated on the ground, andafter making several obeisances, "How are you, my lady?" she inquired.
"Dear Mrs. Chou," lady Feng immediately observed, "do pull her up, anddon't let her prostrate herself! I'm yet young in years and don't knowher much; what's more, I've no idea what's the degree of therelationship between us, and I daren't speak directly to her."
"This is the old lady about whom I spoke a short while back," speedilyexplained Mrs. Chou.
Lady Feng nodded her head assentingly.
By this time old goody Liu had taken a seat on the edge of thestove-couch. As for Pan Erh, he had gone further, and taken refugebehind her back; and though she tried, by every means, to coax him tocome forward and make a bow, he would not, for the life of him, consent.
"Relatives though we be," remarked lady Feng, as she smiled, "we haven'tseen much of each other, so that our relations have been quite distant.But those who know how matters stand will assert that you all despiseus, and won't often come to look us up; while those mean people, whodon't know the truth, will imagine that we have no eyes to look at anyone."
Old goody Liu promptly invoked Buddha. "We are at home in greatstraits," she pleaded, "and that's why it wasn't easy for us to manageto get away and come! Even supposing we had come as far as this, had wenot given your ladyship a slap on the mouth, those gentlemen would also,in point of fact, have looked down upon us as a mean lot."
"Why, language such as this," exclaimed lady Feng smilingly, "cannothelp making one's heart full of displeasure! We simply rely upon thereputation of our grandfather to maintain the status of a pennilessofficial; that's all! Why, in whose household is there anythingsubstantial? we are merely the denuded skeleton of what we were in daysof old, and no more! As the proverb has it: The Emperor himself hasthree families of poverty-stricken relatives; and how much more such asyou and I?"
Having passed these remarks, she inquired of Mrs. Chou, "Have you letmadame know, yes or no?"
"We are now waiting," replied Mrs. Chou, "for my lady's orders."
"Go and have a look," said lady Feng; "but, should there be any onethere, or should she be busy, then don't make any mention; but waituntil she's free, when you can tell her about it and see what she says."
Chou Jui's wife, having expressed her compliance, went off on thiserrand. During her absence, lady Feng gave orders to some servants totake a few fruits and hand them to Pan Erh to eat; and she was inquiringabout one thing and another, when there came a large number of marriedwomen, who had the direction of affairs in the household, to make theirseveral reports.
P'ing Erh announced their arrival to lady Feng, who said: "I'm nowengaged in entertaining some guests, so let them come back again in theevening; but should there be anything pressing then bring it in and I'llsettle it at once."
P'ing Erh left the room, but she returned in a short while. "I've askedthem," she observed, "but as there's nothing of any urgency, I told themto disperse." Lady Feng nodded her head in token of approval, when sheperceived Chou Jui's wife come back. "Our lady," she reported, as sheaddressed lady Feng, "says that she has no leisure to-day, that if you,lady Secunda, will entertain them, it will come to the same thing; thatshe's much obliged for their kind attention in going to the trouble ofcoming; that if they have come simply on a stroll, then well and good,but that if they have aught to say, they should tell you, lady Secunda,which will be tantamount to their telling her."
"I've nothing to say," interposed old goody Liu. "I simply come to seeour elder and our younger lady, which is a duty on my part, a relativeas I am."
"Well, if there's nothing particular that you've got to say, all right,"Mrs. Chou forthwith added, "but if you do have anything, don't hesitatetelling lady Secunda, and it will be just as if you had told our lady."
As she uttered these words, she winked at goody Liu. Goody Liuunderstood what she meant, but before she could give vent to a word, herface got scarlet, and though she would have liked not to make anymention of the object of her visit, she felt constrained to suppress hershame and to speak out.
"Properly speaking," she observed, "this being the first time I see you,my lady, I shouldn't mention what I've to say, but as I come here fromfar off to seek your assistance, my old friend, I have no help but tomention it."
She had barely spoken as much as this, when she heard the youths at theinner-door cry out: "The young gentleman from the Eastern Mansion hascome."
Lady Feng promptly interrupted her. "Old goody Liu," she remarked, "youneedn't add anything more." She, at the same time, inquired, "Where'syour master, Mr. Jung?" when became audible the sound of footsteps alongthe way, and in walked a young man of seventeen or eighteen. Hisappearance was handsome, his person slender and graceful. He had onlight furs, a girdle of value, costly clothes and a beautiful cap.
At this stage, goody Liu did not know whether it was best to sit down orto stand up, neither could she find anywhere to hide herself.
"Pray sit down," urged lady Feng, with a laugh; "this is my nephew!' Oldgoody Liu then wriggled herself, now one way, and then another, on tothe edge of the couch, where she took a seat.
"My father," Chia Jung smilingly ventured, "has sent me to ask a favourof you, aunt. On some previous occasion, our grand aunt gave you, dearaunt, a stove-couch glass screen, and as to-morrow father has invitedsome guests of high standing, he wishes to borrow it to lay it out for alittle show; after which he purposes sending it back again."
"You're late by a day," replied lady Feng. "It was only yesterday that Igave it to some one."
Chia Jung, upon hearing this, forthwith, with giggles and smiles, made,near the edge of the couch, a sort of genuflexion. "Aunt," he went on,"if you don't lend it, father will again say that I don't know how tospeak, and I shall get another sound thrashing. You must have pity uponyour nephew, aunt."
"I've never seen anything like this," observed lady Feng sneeringly;"the things belonging to the Wang family are all good, but where haveyou put all those things of yours? the only good way is that youshouldn't see anything of ours, for as soon as you catch sight ofanything, you at once entertain a wish to carry it off."
"Pray, aunt," entreated Chia Jung with a smile, "do show me somecompassion."
"Mind your skin!" lady Feng warned him, "if you do chip or spoil it inthe least."
She then bade P'ing Erh take the keys of the door of the upstairs roomand send for several trustworthy persons to carry it away.
Chia Jung was so elated that his eyebrows dilated and his eyes smiled."I've brought myself," he added, with vehemence, "some men to take itaway; I won't let them recklessly bump it about."
Saying this, he speedily got up and left the room.
Lady Feng suddenly bethought herself of something, and turning towardsthe window, she called out, "Jung Erh, come back." Several servants whostood outside caught up her words: "Mr. Jung," they cried, "you'rerequested to go back;" whereupon Chia Jung turned round and retraced hissteps; and with hands drooping respectfully against his sides, he stoodready to listen to his aunt's wishes.
Lady Feng was however intent upon gently sipping her tea, and after agood long while of abstraction, she at last smiled: "Never mind," sheremarked; "you can go. But come after you've had your evening meal, andI'll then tell you about it. Just now there are visitors here; andbesides, I don't feel in the humour."
Chia Jung thereupon retired with gentle step.
Old goody Liu, by this time, felt more composed in body and heart. "I'veto-day brought your nephew," she then explained, "not for anything else,but because his father and mother haven't at home so much as anything toeat; the weather besides is already cold, so that I had no help but totake your nephew along and come to you, old friend, for assistance!"
As she uttered these words, she again pushed Pan Erh forward. "What didyour father at home tell you to say?" she asked of him; "and what did hesend us over here to do? Was it only to give our minds to eating fruit?"
Lady Feng had long ago understood what she meant to convey, and findingthat she had no idea how to express herself in a decent manner, shereadily interrupted her with a smile. "You needn't mention anything,"she observed, "I'm well aware of how things stand;" and addressingherself to Mrs. Chou, she inquired, "Has this old lady had breakfast,yes or no?"
Old goody Liu hurried to explain. "As soon as it was daylight," sheproceeded, "we started with all speed on our way here, and had we evenso much as time to have any breakfast?"
Lady Feng promptly gave orders to send for something to eat. In a shortwhile Chou Jui's wife had called for a table of viands for the guests,which was laid in the room on the eastern side, and then came to takegoody Liu and Pan Erh over to have their repast.
"My dear Mrs. Chou," enjoined lady Feng, "give them all they want, as Ican't attend to them myself;" which said, they hastily passed over intothe room on the eastern side.
Lady Feng having again called Mrs. Chou, asked her: "When you firstinformed madame about them, what did she say?" "Our Lady observed,"replied Chou Jui's wife, "that they don't really belong to the samefamily; that, in former years, their grandfather was an official at thesame place as our old master; that hence it came that they joinedancestors; that these few years there hasn't been much intercourse(between their family and ours); that some years back, whenever theycame on a visit, they were never permitted to go empty-handed, and thatas their coming on this occasion to see us is also a kind attention ontheir part, they shouldn't be slighted. If they've anything to say,"(our lady continued), "tell lady Secunda to do the necessary, and thatwill be right."
"Isn't it strange!" exclaimed lady Feng, as soon as she had heard themessage; "since we are all one family, how is it I'm not familiar evenwith so much as their shadow?"
While she was uttering these words, old goody Liu had had her repast andcome over, dragging Pan Erh; and, licking her lips and smacking hermouth, she expressed her thanks.
Lady Feng smiled. "Do pray sit down," she said, "and listen to what I'mgoing to tell you. What you, old lady, meant a little while back toconvey, I'm already as much as yourself well acquainted with! Relatives,as we are, we shouldn't in fact have waited until you came to thethreshold of our doors, but ought, as is but right, to have attended toyour needs. But the thing is that, of late, the household affairs areexceedingly numerous, and our lady, advanced in years as she is,couldn't at a moment, it may possibly be, bethink herself of you all!What's more, when I took over charge of the management of the menage, Imyself didn't know of all these family connections! Besides, though tolook at us from outside everything has a grand and splendid aspect,people aren't aware that large establishments have such great hardships,which, were we to recount to others, they would hardly like to credit astrue. But since you've now come from a great distance, and this is thefirst occasion that you open your mouth to address me, how can I verywell allow you to return to your home with empty hands! By a luckycoincidence our lady gave, yesterday, to the waiting-maids, twenty taelsto make clothes with, a sum which they haven't as yet touched, and ifyou don't despise it as too little, you may take it home as a firstinstalment, and employ it for your wants."
When old goody Liu heard the mention made by lady Feng of theirhardships, she imagined that there was no hope; but upon hearing heragain speak of giving her twenty taels, she was exceedingly delighted,so much so that her eyebrows dilated and her eyes gleamed with smiles.
"We too know," she smilingly remarked, "all about difficulties! but theproverb says, 'A camel dying of leanness is even bigger by much than ahorse!' No matter what those distresses may be, were you yet to pluckone single hair from your body, my old friend, it would be stouter thanour own waist."
Chou Jui's wife stood by, and on hearing her make these coarseutterances, she did all she could to give her a hint by winking, andmake her desist. Lady Feng laughed and paid no heed; but calling P'ingErh, she bade her fetch the parcel of money, which had been given tothem the previous day, and to also bring a string of cash; and whenthese had been placed before goody Liu's eyes: "This is," said ladyFeng, "silver to the amount of twenty taels, which was for the timegiven to these young girls to make winter clothes with; but some otherday, when you've nothing to do, come again on a stroll, in evidence ofthe good feeling which should exist between relatives. It's besidesalready late, and I don't wish to detain you longer and all for nopurpose; but, on your return home, present my compliments to all thoseof yours to whom I should send them."
As she spake, she stood up. Old goody Liu gave utterance to a thousandand ten thousand expressions of gratitude, and taking the silver andcash, she followed Chou Jui's wife on her way to the out-houses. "Well,mother dear," inquired Mrs. Chou, "what did you think of my lady thatyou couldn't speak; and that whenever you opened your mouth it was all'your nephew.' I'll make just one remark, and I don't mind if you do getangry. Had he even been your kindred nephew, you should in fact havebeen somewhat milder in your language; for that gentleman, Mr. Jung, isher kith and kin nephew, and whence has appeared such another nephew ofhers (as Pan Erh)?"
Old goody Liu smiled. "My dear sister-in-law," she replied, "as I gazedupon her, were my heart and eyes, pray, full of admiration or not? andhow then could I speak as I should?"
As they were chatting, they reached Chou Jui's house. They had beensitting for a while, when old goody Liu produced a piece of silver,which she was purposing to leave behind, to be given to the youngservants in Chou Jui's house to purchase fruit to eat; but how couldMrs. Chou satiate her eye with such a small piece of silver? She wasdetermined in her refusal to accept it, so that old goody Liu, afterassuring her of her boundless gratitude, took her departure out of theback gate she had come in from.
Reader, you do not know what happened after old goody Liu left, butlisten to the explanation which will be given in the next chapter.

CHAPTER VII.
  Presentation of artificial flowers made in the Palace.  Chia Lien disports himself with Hsi-feng.  Pao-y� meets Ch'in Chung at a family party.
To resume our narrative. Chou Jui's wife having seen old goody Liu off,speedily came to report the visit to madame Wang; but, contrary to herexpectation, she did not find madame Wang in the drawing-room; and itwas after inquiring of the waiting-maids that she eventually learnt thatshe had just gone over to have a chat with "aunt" Hs�eh. Mrs. Chou, uponhearing this, hastily went out by the eastern corner door, and throughthe yard on the east, into the Pear Fragrance Court.
As soon as she reached the entrance, she caught sight of madame Wang'swaiting-maid, Chin Ch'uan-erh, playing about on the terrace steps, witha young girl, who had just let her hair grow. When they saw Chou Jui'swife approach, they forthwith surmised that she must have some messageto deliver, so they pursed up their lips and directed her to theinner-room. Chou Jui's wife gently raised the curtain-screen, and uponentering discovered madame Wang, in voluble conversation with "aunt"Hs�eh, about family questions and people in general.
Mrs. Chou did not venture to disturb them, and accordingly came into theinner room, where she found Hs�eh Pao-ch'ai in a house dress, with herhair simply twisted into a knot round the top of the head, sitting onthe inner edge of the stove-couch, leaning on a small divan table, inthe act of copying a pattern for embroidery, with the waiting-maid YingErh. When she saw her enter, Pao Ch'ai hastily put down her pencil, andturning round with a face beaming with smiles, "Sister Chou," she said,"take a seat."
Chou Jui's wife likewise promptly returned the smile.
"How is my young lady?" she inquired, as she sat down on the edge of thecouch. "I haven't seen you come over on the other side for two or threedays! Has Mr. Pao-y� perhaps given you offence?"
"What an idea!" exclaimed Pao Ch'ai, with a smile. "It's simply thatI've had for the last couple of days my old complaint again, and thatI've in consequence kept quiet all this time, and looked after myself."
"Is that it?" asked Chou Jui's wife; "but after all, what rooted kind ofcomplaint are you subject to, miss? you should lose really no time insending for a doctor to diagnose it, and give you something to make youall right. With your tender years, to have an organic ailment is indeedno trifle!"
Pao Ch'ai laughed when she heard these remarks.
"Pray," she said, "don't allude to this again; for this ailment of mineI've seen, I can't tell you, how many doctors; taken no end of medicineand spent I don't know how much money; but the more we did so, not theleast little bit of relief did I see. Lucky enough, we eventually cameacross a bald-pated bonze, whose speciality was the cure of namelessillnesses. We therefore sent for him to see me, and he said that I hadbrought this along with me from the womb as a sort of inflammatoryvirus, that luckily I had a constitution strong and hale so that itdidn't matter; and that it would be of no avail if I took pills or anymedicines. He then told me a prescription from abroad, and gave me alsoa packet of a certain powder as a preparative, with a peculiar smell andstrange flavour. He advised me, whenever my complaint broke out, to takea pill, which would be sure to put me right again. And this has, afterall, strange to say, done me a great deal of good."
"What kind of prescription is this one from abroad, I wonder," remarkedMrs. Chou; "if you, miss, would only tell me, it would be worth ourwhile bearing it in mind, and recommending it to others: and if ever wecame across any one afflicted with this disease, we would also be doinga charitable deed."
"You'd better not ask for the prescription," rejoined Pao Ch'ai smiling."Why, its enough to wear one out with perplexity! the necessaries andingredients are few, and all easy to get, but it would be difficult tofind the lucky moment! You want twelve ounces of the pollen of the whitepeone, which flowers in spring, twelve ounces of the pollen of the whitesummer lily, twelve ounces of the pollen of the autumn hibiscus flower,and twelve ounces of the white plum in bloom in the winter. You take thefour kinds of pollen, and put them in the sun, on the very day of thevernal equinox of the succeeding year to get dry, and then you mix themwith the powder and pound them well together. You again want twelve maceof water, fallen on 'rain water' day....."
"Good gracious!" exclaimed Mrs. Chou promptly, as she laughed. "From allyou say, why you want three years' time! and what if no rain falls on'rain water' day! What would one then do?"
"Quite so!" Pao Ch'ai remarked smilingly; "how can there be such anopportune rain on that very day! but to wait is also the best thing,there's nothing else to be done. Besides, you want twelve mace of dew,collected on 'White Dew' day, and twelve mace of the hoar frost,gathered on 'Frost Descent' day, and twelve mace of snow, fallen on'Slight Snow' day! You next take these four kinds of waters and mix themwith the other ingredients, and make pills of the size of a lungngan.You keep them in an old porcelain jar, and bury them under the roots ofsome flowers; and when the ailment betrays itself, you produce it andtake a pill, washing it down with two candareens of a yellow cedardecoction."
"O-mi-to-fu!" cried Mrs. Chou, when she heard all this, bursting outlaughing. "It's really enough to kill one! you might wait ten years andfind no such lucky moments!"
"Fortunate for me, however," pursued Pao Ch'ai, "in the course of a yearor two, after the bonze had told me about this prescription, we got allthe ingredients; and, after much trouble, we compounded a supply, whichwe have now brought along with us from the south to the north; and liesat present under the pear trees."
"Has this medicine any name or other of its own?" further inquired Mrs.Chou.
"It has a name," replied Pao Ch'ai; "the mangy-headed bonze also told itme; he called it 'cold fragrance' pill."
Chou Jui's wife nodded her head, as she heard these words. "What do youfeel like after all when this complaint manifests itself?" she went onto ask.
"Nothing much," replied Pao Ch'ai; "I simply pant and cough a bit; butafter I've taken a pill, I get over it, and it's all gone."
Mrs. Chou was bent upon making some further remark, when madame Wang wassuddenly heard to enquire, "Who is in here?"
Mrs. Chou went out hurriedly and answered; and forthwith told her allabout old goody Liu's visit. Having waited for a while, and seeing thatmadame Wang had nothing to say, she was on the point of retiring, when"aunt" Hsueh unexpectedly remarked smiling: "Wait a bit! I've somethingto give you to take along with you."
And as she spoke, she called for Hsiang Ling. The sound of thescreen-board against the sides of the door was heard, and in walked thewaiting-maid, who had been playing with Chin Ch'uan-erh. "Did my ladycall?" she asked.
"Bring that box of flowers," said Mrs. Hsueh.
Hsiang Ling assented, and brought from the other side a smallembroidered silk box.
"These," explained "aunt" Hs�eh, "are a new kind of flowers, made in thepalace. They consist of twelve twigs of flowers of piled gauze. Ithought of them yesterday, and as they will, the pity is, only get old,if uselessly put away, why not give them to the girls to wear them intheir hair! I meant to have sent them over yesterday, but I forgot allabout them. You come to-day most opportunely, and if you will take themwith you, I shall have got them off my hands. To the three young ladiesin your family give two twigs each, and of the six that will remain givea couple to Miss Lin, and the other four to lady Feng."
"Better keep them and give them to your daughter Pao Ch'ai to wear,"observed madame Wang, "and have done with it; why think of all theothers?"
"You don't know, sister," replied "aunt" Hs�eh, "what a crotchety thingPao Ch'ai is! she has no liking for flower or powder."
With these words on her lips, Chou Jui's wife took the box and walkedout of the door of the room. Perceiving that Chin Ch'uan-erh was stillsunning herself outside, Chou Jui's wife asked her: "Isn't this HsiangLing, the waiting-maid that we've often heard of as having beenpurchased just before the departure of the Hs�eh family for the capital,and on whose account there occurred some case of manslaughter or other?"
"Of course it's she," replied Chin Ch'uan. But as they were talking,they saw Hsiang Ling draw near smirkingly, and Chou Jui's wife at onceseized her by the hand, and after minutely scrutinizing her face for atime, she turned round to Chin Ch'uan-erh and smiled. "With thesefeatures she really resembles slightly the style of lady Jung of ourEastern Mansion."
"So I too maintain!" said Chin Ch'uan-erh.
Chou Jui's wife then asked Hsiang Ling, "At what age did you enter thisfamily? and where are your father and mother at present?" and alsoinquired, "In what year of your teens are you? and of what place are youa native?"
But Hsiang Ling, after listening to all these questions, simply noddedher head and replied, "I can't remember."
When Mrs. Chou and Chin Ch'uan-erh heard these words, their spiritschanged to grief, and for a while they felt affected and wounded atheart; but in a short time, Mrs. Chou brought the flowers into the roomat the back of madame Wang's principal apartment.
The fact is that dowager lady Chia had explained that as hergranddaughters were too numerous, it would not be convenient to crowdthem together in one place, that Pao-y� and Tai-y� should only remainwith her in this part to break her loneliness, but that Ying Ch'un, T'anCh'un, and Hsi Ch'un, the three of them, should move on this side in thethree rooms within the antechamber, at the back of madame lady Wang'squarters; and that Li Wan should be told off to be their attendant andto keep an eye over them.
Chou Jui's wife, therefore, on this occasion came first to these roomsas they were on her way, but she only found a few waiting-maidsassembled in the antechamber, waiting silently to obey a call.
Ying Ch'un's waiting-maid, Ssu Chi, together with Shih Shu, T'an Ch'un'swaiting-maid, just at this moment raised the curtain, and made theiregress, each holding in her hand a tea-cup and saucer; and Chou Jui'swife readily concluding that the young ladies were sitting together alsowalked into the inner room, where she only saw Ying Ch'un and T'an Ch'unseated near the window, in the act of playing chess. Mrs. Chou presentedthe flowers and explained whence they came, and what they were.
The girls forthwith interrupted their game, and both with a curtsey,expressed their thanks, and directed the waiting-maids to put theflowers away.
Mrs. Chou complied with their wishes (and handing over the flowers);"Miss Hsi Ch'un," she remarked, "is not at home; and possibly she's overthere with our old lady."
"She's in that room, isn't she?" inquired the waiting-maids.
Mrs. Chou at these words readily came into the room on this side, whereshe found Hsi Ch'un, in company with a certain Chih Neng, a young nun ofthe "moon reflected on water" convent, talking and laughing together. Onseeing Chou Jui's wife enter, Hsi Ch'un at once asked what she wanted,whereupon Chou Jui's wife opened the box of flowers, and explained whohad sent them.
"I was just telling Chih Neng," remarked Hsi Ch'un laughing, "that Ialso purpose shortly shaving my head and becoming a nun; and strangeenough, here you again bring me flowers; but supposing I shave my head,where can I wear them?"
They were all very much amused for a time with this remark, and HsiCh'un told her waiting-maid, Ju Hua, to come and take over the flowers.
"What time did you come over?" then inquired Mrs. Chou of Chih Neng."Where is that bald-pated and crotchety superior of yours gone?"
"We came," explained Chih Neng, "as soon as it was day; after callingupon madame Wang, my superior went over to pay a visit in the mansion ofMr. Y�, and told me to wait for her here."
"Have you received," further asked Mrs. Chou, "the monthly allowance forincense offering due on the fifteenth or not?"
"I can't say," replied Chih Neng.
"Who's now in charge of the issue of the monthly allowances to thevarious temples?" interposed Hsi Ch'un, addressing Mrs. Chou, as soon asshe heard what was said.
"It's Y� Hsin," replied Chou Jui's wife, "who's intrusted with thecharge."
"That's how it is," observed Hsi Ch'un with a chuckle; "soon after thearrival of the Superior, Y� Hsin's wife came over and kept on whisperingwith her for some time; so I presume it must have been about thisallowance."
Mrs. Chou then went on to bandy a few words with Chih Neng, after whichshe came over to lady Feng's apartments. Proceeding by a narrow passage,she passed under Li Wan's back windows, and went along the wallornamented with creepers on the west. Going out of the western sidegate, she entered lady Feng's court, and walked over into the EntranceHall, where she only found the waiting-girl Feng Erh, sitting on thedoorsteps of lady Feng's apartments.
When she caught sight of Mrs. Chou approaching, she at once waved herhand, bidding her go to the eastern room. Chou Jui's wife understood hermeaning, and hastily came on tiptoe to the chamber on the east, whereshe saw a nurse patting lady Feng's daughter to sleep.
Mrs. Chou promptly asked the nurse in a low tone of voice: "Is the younglady asleep at this early hour? But if even she is I must wake her up."
The nurse nodded her head in assent, but as these inquiries were beingmade, a sound of laughter came from over the other side, in which ladyFeng's voice could be detected; followed, shortly after, by the sound ofa door opening, and out came P'ing Erh, with a large brass basin in herhands, which she told Feng Erh to fill with water and take inside.
P'ing Erh forthwith entered the room on this side, and upon perceivingChou Jui's wife: "What have you come here again for, my old lady?" shereadily inquired.
Chou Jui's wife rose without any delay, and handed her the box. "I'vecome," said she, "to bring you a present of flowers."
Upon hearing this, P'ing Erh opened the box, and took out four sprigs,and, turning round, walked out of the room. In a short while she camefrom the inner room with two sprigs in her hand, and calling first ofall Ts'ai Ming, she bade her take the flowers over to the mansion on theother side and present them to "madame" Jung, after which she asked Mrs.Chou to express her thanks on her return.
Chou Jui's wife thereupon came over to dowager lady Chia's room on thisside of the compound, and as she was going through the Entrance Hall,she casually came, face to face, with her daughter, got up in galadress, just coming from the house of her mother-in-law.
"What are you running over here for at this time?" promptly inquiredMrs. Chou.
"Have you been well of late, mother?" asked her daughter. "I've beenwaiting for ever so long at home, but you never come out! What's thereso pressing that has prevented you from returning home? I waited till Iwas tired, and then went on all alone, and paid my respects to ourvenerable lady; I'm now, on my way to inquire about our lady Wang. Whaterrand haven't you delivered as yet, ma; and what is it you're holding?"
"Ai! as luck would have it," rejoined Chou Jui's wife smilingly, "oldgoody Liu came over to-day, so that besides my own hundred and oneduties, I've had to run about here and there ever so long, and all forher! While attending to these, Mrs. Hsueh came across me, and asked meto take these flowers to the young ladies, and I've been at it up tothis very moment, and haven't done yet! But coming at this time, youmust surely have something or other that you want me to do for you!what's it?"
"Really ma, you're quick at guessing!" exclaimed her daughter with asmile; "I'll tell you what it's all about. The day before yesterday,your son-in-law had a glass of wine too many, and began altercating withsome person or other; and some one, I don't know why, spread some evilreport, saying that his antecedents were not clear, and lodged a chargeagainst him at the Yamen, pressing the authorities to deport him to hisnative place. That's why I've come over to consult with you, as to whomwe should appeal to, to do us this favour of helping us out of ourdilemma!"
"I knew at once," Mrs. Chou remarked after listening, "that there wassomething wrong; but this is nothing hard to settle! Go home and waitfor me and I'll come straightway, as soon as I've taken these flowers toMiss Lin; our madame Wang and lady Secunda have both no leisure (toattend to you now,) so go back and wait for me! What's the use of somuch hurry!"
Her daughter, upon hearing this, forthwith turned round to go back, whenshe added as she walked away, "Mind, mother, and make haste."
"All right," replied Chou Jui's wife, "of course I will; you are youngyet, and without experience, and that's why you are in this flurry."
As she spoke, she betook herself into Tai-y�'s apartments. Contrary toher expectation Tai-y� was not at this time in her own room, but inPao-y�'s; where they were amusing themselves in trying to solve the"nine strung rings" puzzle. On entering Mrs. Chou put on a smile."'Aunt' Hs�eh," she explained, "has told me to bring these flowers andpresent them to you to wear in your hair."
"What flowers?" exclaimed Pao-y�. "Bring them here and let me see them."
As he uttered these words, he readily stretched out his hands and tookthem over, and upon opening the box and looking in, he discovered, infact, two twigs of a novel and artistic kind of artificial flowers, ofpiled gauze, made in the palace.
Tai-y� merely cast a glance at them, as Pao-y� held them. "Have theseflowers," she inquired eagerly, "been sent to me alone, or have all theother girls got some too?"
"Each one of the young ladies has the same," replied Mrs. Chou; "andthese two twigs are intended for you, miss."
Tai-y� forced a smile. "Oh! I see," she observed. "If all the othershadn't chosen, even these which remain over wouldn't have been given tome."
Chou Jui's wife did not utter a word in reply.
"Sister Chou, what took you over on the other side?" asked Pao-y�.
"I was told that our madame Wang was over there," explained Mrs. Chou,"and as I went to give her a message, 'aunt' Hs�eh seized theopportunity to ask me to bring over these flowers."
"What was cousin Pao Ch'ai doing at home?" asked Pao-y�. "How is itshe's not even been over for these few days?"
"She's not quite well," remarked Mrs. Chou.
When Pao-y� heard this news, "Who'll go," he speedily ascertained of thewaiting-maids, "and inquire after her? Tell her that cousin Lin and Ihave sent round to ask how our aunt and cousin are getting on! ask herwhat she's ailing from and what medicines she's taking, and explain toher that I know I ought to have gone over myself, but that on my comingback from school a short while back, I again got a slight chill; andthat I'll go in person another day."
While Pao-y� was yet speaking, Hsi Hs�eh volunteered to take themessage, and went off at once; and Mrs. Chou herself took her leavewithout another word.
Mrs. Chou's son-in-law was, in fact, Leng Tzu-hsing, the intimate friendof Y�-ts'un. Having recently become involved with some party in alawsuit, on account of the sale of some curios, he had expressly chargedhis wife to come and sue for the favour (of a helping hand). Chou Jui'swife, relying upon her master's prestige, did not so much as take theaffair to heart; and having waited till evening, she simply went overand requested lady Feng to befriend her, and the matter was forthwithended.
When the lamps were lit, lady Feng came over, after having disrobedherself, to see madame Wang. "I've already taken charge," she observed,"of the things sent round to-day by the Chen family. As for the presentsfrom us to them, we should avail ourselves of the return of the boats,by which the fresh delicacies for the new year were forwarded, to handthem to them to carry back."
Madame Wang nodded her head in token of approval.
"The birthday presents," continued lady Feng, "for lady Ling Ngan, themother of the Earl of Ling Ngan, have already been got together, andwhom will you depute to take them over?"
"See," suggested madame Wang, "who has nothing to do; let four maids goand all will be right! why come again and ask me?"
"Our eldest sister-in-law Chen," proceeded lady Feng, "came over toinvite me to go to-morrow to their place for a little change. I don'tthink there will be anything for me to do to-morrow."
"Whether there be or not," replied madame Wang, "it doesn't matter; youmust go, for whenever she comes with an invitation, it includes us, whoare your seniors, so that, of course, it isn't such a pleasant thing foryou; but as she doesn't ask us this time, but only asks you, it'sevident that she's anxious that you should have a little distraction,and you mustn't disappoint her good intention. Besides it's certainlyright that you should go over for a change."
Lady Feng assented, and presently Li Wan, Ying Ch'un and the othercousins, likewise paid each her evening salutation and retired to theirrespective rooms, where nothing of any notice transpired.
The next day lady Feng completed her toilette, and came over first totell madame Wang that she was off, and then went to say good-bye todowager lady Chia; but when Pao-y� heard where she was going, he alsowished to go; and as lady Feng had no help but to give in, and to waituntil he had changed his clothes, the sister and brother-in-law got intoa carriage, and in a short while entered the Ning mansion.
Mrs. Yu, the wife of Chia Chen, and Mrs. Ch'in, the wife of Mr. ChiaJung, the two sisters-in-law, had, along with a number of maids,waiting-girls, and other servants, come as far as the ceremonial gate toreceive them, and Mrs. Yu, upon meeting lady Feng, for a while indulged,as was her wont, in humorous remarks, after which, leading Pao-y� by thehand, they entered the drawing room and took their seats, Mrs. Ch'inhanded tea round.
"What have you people invited me to come here for?" promptly asked ladyFeng; "if you have anything to present me with, hand it to me at once,for I've other things to attend to."
Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Ch'in had barely any time to exchange any furtherremarks, when several matrons interposed, smilingly: "Had our lady notcome to-day, there would have been no help for it, but having come, youcan't have it all your own way."
While they were conversing about one thing and another, they caughtsight of Chia Jung come in to pay his respects, which prompted Pao-y� toinquire, "Isn't my elder brother at home to-day?"
"He's gone out of town to-day," replied Mrs. Yu, "to inquire after hisgrandfather. You'll find sitting here," she continued, "very dull, andwhy not go out and have a stroll?"
"A strange coincidence has taken place to-day," urged Mrs. Ch'in, with asmile; "some time back you, uncle Pao, expressed a wish to see mybrother, and to-day he too happens to be here at home. I think he's inthe library; but why not go and see for yourself, uncle Pao?"
Pao-y� descended at once from the stove-couch, and was about to go, whenMrs. Yu bade the servants to mind and go with him. "Don't you let himget into trouble," she enjoined. "It's a far different thing when hecomes over under the charge of his grandmother, when he's all right."
"If that be so," remarked lady Feng, "why not ask the young gentleman tocome in, and then I too can see him. There isn't, I hope, any objectionto my seeing him?"
"Never mind! never mind!" observed Mrs. Yu, smilingly; "it's as wellthat you shouldn't see him. This brother of mine is not, like the boysof our Chia family, accustomed to roughly banging and knocking about.Other people's children are brought up politely and properly, and not inthis vixenish style of yours. Why, you'd ridicule him to death!"
"I won't laugh at him then, that's all," smiled lady Feng; "tell them tobring him in at once."
"He's shy," proceeded Mrs. Ch'in, "and has seen nothing much of theworld, so that you are sure to be put out when you see him, sister."
"What an idea!" exclaimed lady Feng. "Were he even No Cha himself, I'dlike to see him; so don't talk trash; if, after all, you don't bring himround at once, I'll give you a good slap on the mouth."
"I daren't be obstinate," answered Mrs. Ch'in smiling; "I'll bring himround!"
In a short while she did in fact lead in a young lad, who, compared withPao-y�, was somewhat more slight but, from all appearances, superior toPao-y� in eyes and eyebrows, (good looks), which were so clear andwell-defined, in white complexion and in ruddy lips, as well as gracefulappearance and pleasing manners. He was however bashful and timid, likea girl.
In a shy and demure way, he made a bow to lady Feng and asked after herhealth.
Lady Feng was simply delighted with him. "You take a low seat next tohim!" she ventured laughingly as she first pushed Pao-y� back. Thenreadily stooping forward, she took this lad by the hand and asked him totake a seat next to her. Presently she inquired about his age, hisstudies and such matters, when she found that at school he went underthe name of Ch'in Chung.
The matrons and maids in attendance on lady Feng, perceiving that thiswas the first time their mistress met Ch'in Chung, (and knowing) thatshe had not at hand the usual presents, forthwith ran over to the otherside and told P'ing Erh about it.
P'ing Erh, aware of the close intimacy that existed between lady Fengand Mrs. Ch'in, speedily took upon herself to decide, and selecting apiece of silk, and two small gold medals, (bearing the wish that heshould attain) the highest degree, the senior wranglership, she handedthem to the servants who had come over, to take away.
Lady Feng, however, explained that her presents were too mean by far,but Mrs. Ch'in and the others expressed their appreciation of them; andin a short time the repast was over, and Mrs. Yu, lady Feng and Mrs.Ch'in played at dominoes, but of this no details need be given; whileboth Pao-y� and Ch'in Chung sat down, got up and talked, as theypleased.
Since he had first glanced at Ch'in Chung, and seen what kind of personhe was, he felt at heart as if he had lost something, and after beingplunged in a dazed state for a time, he began again to give way tofoolish thoughts in his mind.
"There are then such beings as he in the world!" he reflected. "I nowsee there are! I'm however no better than a wallowing pig or a mangycow! Despicable destiny! why was I ever born in this household of amarquis and in the mansion of a duke? Had I seen the light in the homeof some penniless scholar, or poverty-stricken official, I could longago have enjoyed the communion of his friendship, and I would not havelived my whole existence in vain! Though more honourable than he, it isindeed evident that silk and satins only serve to swathe this rottentrunk of mine, and choice wines and rich meats only to gorge the filthydrain and miry sewer of this body of mine! Wealth! and splendour! ye areno more than contaminated with pollution by me!"
Ever since Ch'in Chung had noticed Pao-y�'s unusual appearance, hissedate deportment, and what is more, his hat ornamented with gold, andhis dress full of embroidery, attended by beautiful maids and handsomeyouths, he did not indeed think it a matter of surprise that every onewas fond of him.
"Born as I have had the misfortune to be," he went on to commune withinhimself, "in an honest, though poor family, how can I presume to enjoyhis companionship! This is verily a proof of what a barrier poverty andwealth set between man and man. What a serious misfortune is this too inthis mortal world!"
In wild and inane ideas of the same strain, indulged these two youths!
Pao-y� by and by further asked of him what books he was reading, andCh'in Chung, in answer to these inquiries, told him the truth. A fewmore questions and answers followed; and after about ten remarks, agreater intimacy sprang up between them.
Tea and fruits were shortly served, and while they were having theirtea, Pao-y� suggested, "We two don't take any wine, and why shouldn't wehave our fruit served on the small couch inside, and go and sit there,and thus save you all the trouble?"
The two of them thereupon came into the inner apartment to have theirtea; and Mrs. Ch'in attended to the laying out of fruit and wines forlady Feng, and hurriedly entered the room and hinted to Pao-y�: "Dearuncle Pao, your nephew is young, and should he happen to say anythingdisrespectful, do please overlook it, for my sake, for though shy, he'snaturally of a perverse and wilful disposition, and is rather given tohaving his own way."
"Off with you!" cried Pao-y� laughing; "I know it all." Mrs. Ch'in thenwent on to give a bit of advice to her brother, and at length came tokeep lady Feng company. Presently lady Feng and Mrs. Yu sent anotherservant to tell Pao-y� that there was outside of everything they mightwish to eat and that they should mind and go and ask for it; and Pao-y�simply signified that they would; but his mind was not set upon drinkingor eating; all he did was to keep making inquiries of Ch'in Chung aboutrecent family concerns.
Ch'in Chung went on to explain that his tutor had last year relinquishedhis post, that his father was advanced in years and afflicted withdisease, and had multifarious public duties to preoccupy his mind, sothat he had as yet had no time to make arrangements for another tutor,and that all he did was no more than to keep up his old tasks; that asregards study, it was likewise necessary to have the company of one ortwo intimate friends, as then only, by dint of a frequent exchange ofideas and opinions, one could arrive at progress; and Pao-y� gave him notime to complete, but eagerly urged, "Quite so! But in our household, wehave a family school, and those of our kindred who have no meanssufficient to engage the services of a tutor are at liberty to come overfor the sake of study, and the sons and brothers of our relatives arelikewise free to join the class. As my own tutor went home last year, Iam now also wasting my time doing nothing; my father's intention wasthat I too should have gone over to this school, so that I might atleast temporarily keep up what I have already read, pending the arrivalof my tutor next year, when I could again very well resume my studiesalone at home. But my grandmother raised objections; maintaining firstof all, that the boys who attend the family classes being so numerous,she feared we would be sure to be up to mischief, which wouldn't be atall proper; and that, in the second place, as I had been ill for sometime, the matter should be dropped, for the present. But as, from whatyou say, your worthy father is very much exercised on this score, youshould, on your return, tell him all about it, and come over to ourschool. I'll also be there as your schoolmate; and as you and I willreap mutual benefit from each other's companionship, won't it be nice!"
"When my father was at home the other day," Ch'in Chung smiled and said,"he alluded to the question of a tutor, and explained that the freeschools were an excellent institution. He even meant to have come andtalked matters over with his son-in-law's father about my introduction,but with the urgent concerns here, he didn't think it right for him tocome about this small thing, and make any trouble. But if you reallybelieve that I might be of use to you, in either grinding the ink, orwashing the slab, why shouldn't you at once make the needfularrangements, so that neither you nor I may idle our time? And as weshall be able to come together often and talk matters over, and set atthe same time our parents' minds at ease, and to enjoy the pleasure offriendship, won't it be a profitable thing!"
"Compose your mind!" suggested Pao-y�. "We can by and by first of all,tell your brother-in-law, and your sister as well as sister-in-lawSecunda Lien; and on your return home to-day, lose no time in explainingall to your worthy father, and when I get back, I'll speak to mygrandmother; and I can't see why our wishes shouldn't speedily beaccomplished."
By the time they had arrived at this conclusion, the day was faradvanced, and the lights were about to be lit; and they came out andwatched them once more for a time as they played at dominoes. When theycame to settle their accounts Mrs. Ch'in and Mrs. Yu were again thelosers and had to bear the expense of a theatrical and dinner party; andwhile deciding that they should enjoy this treat the day after themorrow, they also had the evening repast.
Darkness having set in, Mrs. Yu gave orders that two youths shouldaccompany Mr. Ch'in home. The matrons went out to deliver thedirections, and after a somewhat long interval, Ch'in Chung said goodbyeand was about to start on his way.
"Whom have you told off to escort him?" asked Mrs. Yu.
"Chiao Ta," replied the matrons, "has been told to go, but it happensthat he's under the effects of drink and making free use again ofabusive language."
Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Chin remonstrated. "What's the use," they said, "ofasking him? that mean fellow shouldn't be chosen, but you will go againand provoke him."
"People always maintain," added lady Feng, "that you are far toolenient. But fancy allowing servants in this household to go on in thisway; why, what will be the end of it?"
"You don't mean to tell me," observed Mrs. Yu, "that you don't know thisChiao Ta? Why, even the gentlemen one and all pay no heed to his doings!your eldest brother, Chia Cheng, he too doesn't notice him. It's allbecause when he was young he followed our ancestor in three or fourwars, and because on one occasion, by extracting our senior from theheap of slain and carrying him on his back, he saved his life. Hehimself suffered hunger and stole food for his master to eat; they hadno water for two days; and when he did get half a bowl, he gave it tohis master, while he himself had sewage water. He now simply presumesupon the sentimental obligations imposed by these services. When theseniors of the family still lived, they all looked upon him withexceptional regard; but who at present ventures to interfere with him?He is also advanced in years, and doesn't care about any decent manners;his sole delight is wine; and when he gets drunk, there isn't a singleperson whom he won't abuse. I've again and again told the stewards notto henceforward ask Chiao Ta to do any work whatever, but to treat himas dead and gone; and here he's sent again to-day."
"How can I not know all about this Chiao Ta?" remarked lady Feng; "butthe secret of all this trouble is, that you won't take any decisivestep. Why not pack him off to some distant farm, and have done withhim?" And as she spoke, "Is our carriage ready?" she went on to inquire.
"All ready and waiting," interposed the married women.
Lady Feng also got up, said good-bye, and hand in hand with Pao-y�, theywalked out of the room, escorted by Mrs. Yu and the party, as far as theentrance of the Main Hall, where they saw the lamps shedding a brilliantlight and the attendants all waiting on the platforms. Chiao Ta,however, availing himself of Chia Chen's absence from home, and elatedby wine, began to abuse the head steward Lai Erh for his injustice.
"You bully of the weak and coward with the strong," he cried, "whenthere's any pleasant charge, you send the other servants, but when it'sa question of seeing any one home in the dark, then you ask me, youdisorderly clown! a nice way you act the steward, indeed! Do you forgetthat if Mr. Chiao Ta chose to raise one leg, it would be a good dealhigher than your head! Remember please, that twenty years ago, Mr. ChiaoTa wouldn't even so much as look at any one, no matter who it was; notto mention a pack of hybrid creatures like yourselves!"
While he went on cursing and railing with all his might, Chia Jungappeared walking by lady Feng's carriage. All the servants having triedto hush him and not succeeding, Chia Jung became exasperated; andforthwith blew him up for a time. "Let some one bind him up," he cried,"and tomorrow, when he's over the wine, I'll call him to task, and we'llsee if he won't seek death."
Chiao Ta showed no consideration for Chia Jung. On the contrary, heshouted with more vigour. Going up to Chia Jung: "Brother Jung," hesaid, "don't put on the airs of a master with Chiao Ta. Not to speak ofa man such as you, why even your father and grandfather wouldn't presumeto display such side with Chiao Ta. Were it not for Chiao Ta, and himalone, where would your office, honours, riches and dignity be? Yourancestor, whom I brought back from the jaws of death, heaped up all thisestate, but up to this very day have I received no thanks for theservices I rendered! on the contrary, you come here and play the master;don't say a word more, and things may come right; but if you do, I'llplunge the blade of a knife white in you and extract it red."
Lady Feng, from inside the carriage, remarked to Chia Jung: "Don't youyet pack off this insolent fellow! Why, if you keep him in your house,won't he be a source of mischief? Besides, were relatives and friends tohear about these things, won't they have a laugh at our expense, that ahousehold like ours should be so devoid of all propriety?"
Chia Jung assented. The whole band of servants finding that Chiao Ta wasgetting too insolent had no help but to come up and throw him over, andbinding him up, they dragged him towards the stables. Chiao Ta abusedeven Chia Chen with still more vehemence, and shouted in a boisterousmanner. "I want to go," he cried, "to the family Ancestral Temple andmourn my old master. Who would have ever imagined that he would leavebehind such vile creatures of descendants as you all, day after dayindulging in obscene and incestuous practices, 'in scraping of theashes' and in philandering with brothers-in-law. I know all about yourdoings; the best thing is to hide one's stump of an arm in one'ssleeve!" (wash one's dirty clothes at home).
The servants who stood by, upon hearing this wild talk, were quite attheir wits' end, and they at once seized him, tied him up, and filledhis mouth to the fullest extent with mud mixed with some horse refuse.
Lady Feng and Chia Jung heard all he said from a distance, but pretendednot to hear; but Pao-y�, seated in the carriage as he was, also caughtthis extravagant talk and inquired of lady Feng: "Sister, did you hearhim say something about 'scraping of the ashes?' What's it?"
"Don't talk such rubbish!" hastily shouted lady Feng; "it was themaudlin talk of a drunkard! A nice boy you are! not to speak of yourlistening, but you must also inquire! wait and I'll tell your mother andwe'll see if she doesn't seriously take you to task."
Pao-y� was in such a state of fright that he speedily entreated her toforgive him. "My dear sister," he craved, "I won't venture again to sayanything of the kind"
"My dear brother, if that be so, it's all right!" rejoined lady Fengreassuringly; "on our return we'll speak to her venerable ladyship andask her to send some one to arrange matters in the family school, andinvite Ch'in Chung to come to school for his studies."
While yet this conversation was going on, they arrived at the JungMansion.
Reader, do you wish to know what follows? if you do, the next chapterwill unfold it.

CHAPTER VIII.
  By a strange coincidence, Chia Pao-y� becomes acquainted with the      golden clasp.  In an unexpected meeting, Hs�eh Pao-ch'ai sees the jade of spiritual      perception.
Pao-y� and lady Feng, we will now explain, paid, on their return home,their respects to all the inmates, and Pao-y� availed himself of thefirst occasion to tell dowager lady Chia of his wish that Ch'in Chungshould come over to the family school. "The presence for himself of afriend as schoolmate would," he argued, "be fitly excellent to stir himto zeal," and he went on to speak in terms of high praise of Ch'inChung, his character and his manners, which most of all made peopleesteem him.
Lady Feng besides stood by him and backed his request. "In a day ortwo," she added, "Ch'in Chung will be coming to pay his obeisance toyour venerable ladyship."
This bit of news greatly rejoiced the heart of dowager lady Chia, andlady Feng likewise did not let the opportunity slip, without invitingthe old lady to attend the theatrical performance to come off the dayafter the morrow. Dowager lady Chia was, it is true, well on in years,but was, nevertheless, very fond of enjoyment, so that when the dayarrived and Mrs. Yu came over to invite her round, she forthwith tookmadame Wang, Lin Tai-y�, Pao-y� and others along and went to the play.
It was about noon, when dowager lady Chia returned to her apartments forher siesta; and madame Wang, who was habitually partial to a quiet life,also took her departure after she had seen the old lady retire. LadyFeng subsequently took the seat of honour; and the party enjoyedthemselves immensely till the evening, when they broke up.
But to return to Pao-y�. Having accompanied his grandmother Chia backhome, and waited till her ladyship was in her midday sleep, he had infact an inclination to return to the performance, but he was afraid lesthe should be a burden to Mrs. Ch'in and the rest and lest they shouldnot feel at ease. Remembering therefore that Pao Ch'ai had been at homeunwell for the last few days, and that he had not been to see her, hewas anxious to go and look her up, but he dreaded that if he went by theside gate, at the back of the drawing-room, he would be prevented bysomething or other, and fearing, what would be making matters worse,lest he should come across his father, he consequently thought it betterto go on his way by a detour. The nurses and waiting-maids thereuponcame to help him to change his clothes; but they saw him not change, butgo out again by the second door. These nurses and maids could not helpfollowing him out; but they were still under the impression that he wasgoing over to the other mansion to see the theatricals. Contrary totheir speculations, upon reaching the entrance hall, he forthwith wentto the east, then turned to the north, and walking round by the rear ofthe hall, he happened to come face to face with two of the familycompanions, Mr. Ch'an Kuang, and Mr. Tan T'ing-jen. As soon as theycaught sight of Pao-y�, they both readily drew up to him, and as theysmiled, the one put his arm round his waist, while the other grasped himby the hand.
"Oh divine brother!" they both exclaimed, "this we call dreaming apleasant dream, for it's no easy thing to come across you!"
While continuing their remarks they paid their salutations, and inquiredafter his health; and it was only after they had chatted for ever solong, that they went on their way. The nurse called out to them andstopped them, "Have you two gentlemen," she said, "come out from seeingmaster?"
They both nodded assent. "Your master," they explained, "is in the MengP'o Chai small library having his siesta; so that you can go throughthere with no fear."
As they uttered these words, they walked away.
This remark also evoked a smile from Pao-y�, but without further delayhe turned a corner, went towards the north, and came into the PearFragrance Court, where, as luck would have it, he met the head managerof the Household Treasury, Wu Hsin-teng, who, in company with the headof the granary, Tai Liang, and several other head stewards, sevenpersons in all, was issuing out of the Account Room.
On seeing Pao-y� approaching, they, in a body, stood still, and hungdown their arms against their sides. One of them alone, a certainbutler, called Ch'ien Hua, promptly came forward, as he had not seenPao-y� for many a day, and bending on one knee, paid his respects toPao-y�. Pao-y� at once gave a smile and pulled him up.
"The day before yesterday," smiled all the bystanders, "we weresomewhere together and saw some characters written by you, masterSecundus, in the composite style. The writing is certainly better thanit was before! When will you give us a few sheets to stick on the wall?"
"Where did you see them?" inquired Pao-y�, with a grin.
"They are to be found in more than one place," they replied, "and everyone praises them very much, and what's more, asks us for a few."
"They are not worth having," observed Pao-y� smilingly; "but if you dowant any, tell my young servants and it will be all right."
As he said these words, he moved onwards. The whole party waited till hehad gone by, before they separated, each one to go his own way.
But we need not dilate upon matters of no moment, but return to Pao-y�.
On coming to the Pear Fragrance Court, he entered, first, into "aunt"Hs�eh's room, where he found her getting some needlework ready to giveto the waiting-maids to work at. Pao-y� forthwith paid his respects toher, and "aunt" Hs�eh, taking him by the hand, drew him towards her andclasped him in her embrace.
"With this cold weather," she smilingly urged, "it's too kind of you, mydear child, to think of coming to see me; come along on the stove-couchat once!--Bring some tea," she continued, addressing the servants, "andmake it as hot as it can be!"
"Isn't Hs�eh P'an at home?" Pao-y� having inquired: "He's like a horsewithout a halter," Mrs. Hs�eh remarked with a sigh; "he's daily runninghere and there and everywhere, and nothing can induce him to stay athome one single day."
"Is sister (Pao Ch'ai) all right again?" asked Pao-y�. "Yes," repliedMrs. Hs�eh, "she's well again. It was very kind of you two days ago toagain think of her, and send round to inquire after her. She's now inthere, and you can go and see her. It's warmer there than it's here; goand sit with her inside, and, as soon as I've put everything away, I'llcome and join you and have a chat."
Pao-y�, upon hearing this, jumped down with alacrity from thestove-couch, and walked up to the door of the inner room, where he sawhanging a porti�re somewhat the worse for use, made of red silk. Pao-y�raised the porti�re and making one step towards the interior, he foundPao Ch'ai seated on the couch, busy over some needlework. On the top ofher head was gathered, and made into a knot, her chevelure, black aslacquer, and glossy like pomade. She wore a honey-coloured wadded robe,a rose-brown short-sleeved jacket, lined with the fur of the squirrel oftwo colours: the "gold and silver;" and a jupe of leek-yellow silk. Herwhole costume was neither too new, neither too old, and displayed nosign of extravagance.
Her lips, though not rouged, were naturally red; her eyebrows, thoughnot pencilled, were yet blue black; her face resembled a silver basin,and her eyes, juicy plums. She was sparing in her words, chary in hertalk, so much so that people said that she posed as a simpleton. She wasquiet in the acquittal of her duties and scrupulous as to the properseason for everything. "I practise simplicity," she would say ofherself.
"How are you? are you quite well again, sister?" inquired Pao-y�, as hegazed at her; whereupon Pao Ch'ai raised her head, and perceiving Pao-y�walk in, she got up at once and replied with a smile, "I'm all rightagain; many thanks for your kindness in thinking of me."
While uttering this, she pressed him to take a seat on the stove-couch,and as he sat down on the very edge of the couch, she told Ying Erh tobring tea and asked likewise after dowager lady Chia and lady Feng. "Andare all the rest of the young ladies quite well?" she inquired.
Saying this she scrutinised Pao-y�, who she saw had a head-dress ofpurplish-gold twisted threads, studded with precious stones. Hisforehead was bound with a gold circlet, representing two dragons,clasping a pearl. On his person he wore a light yellow, archery-sleevedjacket, ornamented with rampant dragons, and lined with fur from theribs of the silver fox; and was clasped with a dark sash, embroideredwith different-coloured butterflies and birds. Round his neck was hungan amulet, consisting of a clasp of longevity, a talisman of recordedname, and, in addition to these, the precious jade which he had had inhis mouth at the time of his birth.
"I've daily heard every one speak of this jade," said Pao Ch'ai with asmile, "but haven't, after all, had an opportunity of looking at itclosely, but anyhow to-day I must see it."
As she spoke, she drew near. Pao-y� himself approached, and taking itfrom his neck, he placed it in Pao Ch'ai's hand. Pao Ch'ai held it inher palm. It appeared to her very much like the egg of a bird,resplendent as it was like a bright russet cloud; shiny and smooth likevariegated curd and covered with a net for the sake of protection.
Readers, you should know that this was the very block of useless stonewhich had been on the Ta Huang Hills, and which had dropped into theCh'ing Keng cave, in a state of metamorphosis. A later writer expresseshis feelings in a satirical way as follows:
  N� Wo's fusion of stones was e'er a myth inane,  But from this myth hath sprung fiction still more insane!  Lost is the subtle life, divine, and real!--gone!  Assumed, mean subterfuge! foul bags of skin and bone!  Fortune, when once adverse, how true! gold glows no more!  In evil days, alas! the jade's splendour is o'er!  Bones, white and bleached, in nameless hill-like mounds are flung,  Bones once of youths renowned and maidens fair and young.
The rejected stone has in fact already given a record of thecircumstances of its transformation, and the inscription in sealcharacters, engraved upon it by the bald-headed bonze, and below willnow be also appended a faithful representation of it; but its real sizeis so very diminutive, as to allow of its being held by a child in hismouth while yet unborn, that were it to have been drawn in its exactproportions, the characters would, it is feared, have been soinsignificant in size, that the beholder would have had to waste much ofhis eyesight, and it would besides have been no pleasant thing.
While therefore its shape has been adhered to, its size has unavoidablybeen slightly enlarged, to admit of the reader being able, conveniently,to peruse the inscription, even by very lamplight, and though he may beunder the influence of wine.
These explanations have been given to obviate any such sneering remarksas: "What could be, pray, the size of the mouth of a child in hismother's womb, and how could it grasp such a large and clumsy thing?"
On the face of the jade was written:
  Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception.  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!
On the reverse was written:
  1 To exorcise evil spirits and the accessory visitations;  2 To cure predestined sickness;  3 To prognosticate weal and woe.
Pao Ch'ai having looked at the amulet, twisted it again to the face, andscrutinising it closely, read aloud:
  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!
She perused these lines twice, and, turning round, she asked Ying Erhlaughingly: "Why don't you go and pour the tea? what are you standinghere like an idiot!"
"These two lines which I've heard," smiled Ying Erh, "would appear topair with the two lines on your necklet, miss!"
"What!" eagerly observed Pao-y� with a grin, when he caught these words,"are there really eight characters too on your necklet, cousin? do letme too see it."
"Don't listen to what she says," remarked Pao Ch'ai, "there are nocharacters on it."
"My dear cousin," pleaded Pao-y� entreatingly, "how is it you've seenmine?"
Pao Ch'ai was brought quite at bay by this remark of his, and sheconsequently added, "There are also two propitious phrases engraved onthis charm, and that's why I wear it every day. Otherwise, what pleasurewould there be in carrying a clumsy thing."
As she spoke, she unfastened the button, and produced from inside hercrimson robe, a crystal-like locket, set with pearls and gems, and witha brilliant golden fringe. Pao-y� promptly received it from her, andupon minute examination, found that there were in fact four characterson each side; the eight characters on both sides forming two sentencesof good omen. The similitude of the locket is likewise then given below.On the face of the locket is written:
  "Part not from me and cast me not away;"
And on the reverse:
  "And youth, perennial freshness will display!"
Pao-y� examined the charm, and having also read the inscription twiceover aloud, and then twice again to himself, he said as he smiled, "Dearcousin, these eight characters of yours form together with mine anantithetical verse."
"They were presented to her," ventured Ying Erh, "by a mangy-patedbonze, who explained that they should be engraved on a goldentrinket...."
Pao Ch'ai left her no time to finish what she wished to say, butspeedily called her to task for not going to bring the tea, and theninquired of Pao-y� "Where he had come from?"
Pao-y� had, by this time, drawn quite close to Pao Ch'ai, and perceivedwhiff after whiff of some perfume or other, of what kind he could nottell. "What perfume have you used, my cousin," he forthwith asked, "tofumigate your dresses with? I really don't remember smelling anyperfumery of the kind before."
"I'm very averse," replied Pao Ch'ai blandly, "to the odour offumigation; good clothes become impregnated with the smell of smoke."
"In that case," observed Pao-y�, "what scent is it?"
"Yes, I remember," Pao Ch'ai answered, after some reflection; "it's thescent of the 'cold fragrance' pills which I took this morning."
"What are these cold fragrance pills," remarked Pao-y� smiling, "thatthey have such a fine smell? Give me, cousin, a pill to try."
"Here you are with your nonsense again," Pao Ch'ai rejoined laughingly;"is a pill a thing to be taken recklessly?"
She had scarcely finished speaking, when she heard suddenly some oneoutside say, "Miss Lin is come;" and shortly Lin Tai-y� walked in in ajaunty manner.
"Oh, I come at a wrong moment!" she exclaimed forthwith, smirkingsignificantly when she caught sight of Pao-y�.
Pao-y� and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat,whereupon Pao Ch'ai added with a smile, "How can you say such things?"
"Had I known sooner," continued Tai-y�, "that he was here, I would havekept away."
"I can't fathom this meaning of yours," protested Pao Ch'ai.
"If one comes," Tai-y� urged smiling, "then all come, and when onedoesn't come, then no one comes. Now were he to come to-day, and I tocome to-morrow, wouldn't there be, by a division of this kind, alwayssome one with you every day? and in this way, you wouldn't feel toolonely, nor too crowded. How is it, cousin, that you didn't understandwhat I meant to imply?"
"Is it snowing?" inquired Pao-y�, upon noticing that she wore a cloakmade of crimson camlet, buttoning in front.
"It has been snowing for some time," ventured the matrons, who werestanding below. "Fetch my wrapper!" Pao-y� remarked, and Tai-y� readilylaughed. "Am I not right? I come, and, of course, he must go at once."
"Did I ever mention that I was going?" questioned Pao-y�; "I only wishit brought to have it ready when I want it."
"It's a snowy day," consequently remarked Pao-y�'s nurse, dame Li, "andwe must also look to the time, but you had better remain here and amuseyourself with your cousin. Your aunt has, in there, got ready tea andfruits. I'll tell the waiting-maid to go and fetch your wrapper and theboys to return home." Pao-y� assented, and nurse Li left the room andtold the boys that they were at liberty to go.
By this time Mrs. Hs�eh had prepared tea and several kinds of nicethings and kept them all to partake of those delicacies. Pao-y�, havingspoken highly of some goose feet and ducks' tongues he had tasted somedays before, at his eldest sister-in-law's, Mrs. Yu's, "aunt" Hs�ehpromptly produced several dishes of the same kind, made by herself, andgave them to Pao-y� to try. "With a little wine," added Pao-y� with asmile, "they would be first rate."
Mrs. Hs�eh thereupon bade the servants fetch some wine of the bestquality; but dame Li came forward and remonstrated. "My lady," she said,"never mind the wine."
Pao-y� smilingly pleaded: "My nurse, I'll take just one cup and nomore."
"It's no use," nurse Li replied, "were your grandmother and motherpresent, I wouldn't care if you drank a whole jar. I remember the daywhen I turned my eyes away but for a moment, and some ignorant fool orother, merely with the view of pandering for your favour, gave you onlya drop of wine to drink, and how this brought reproaches upon me for acouple of days. You don't know, my lady, you have no idea of hisdisposition! it's really dreadful; and when he has had a little wine heshows far more temper. On days when her venerable ladyship is in highspirits, she allows him to have his own way about drinking, but he's notallowed to have wine on any and every day; and why should I have tosuffer inside and all for nothing at all?"
"You antiquated thing!" replied Mrs. Hs�eh laughing, "set your mind atease, and go and drink your own wine! I won't let him have too much, andshould even the old lady say anything, let the fault be mine."
Saying this, she asked a waiting-maid to take nurse Li along with herand give her also a glass of wine so as to keep out the cold air.
When nurse Li heard these words, she had no alternative but to go for atime with all the others and have some wine to drink.
"The wine need not be warmed: I prefer it cold!" Pao-y� went on tosuggest meanwhile.
"That won't do," remonstrated Mrs. Hs�eh; "cold wine will make your handtremble when you write."
"You have," interposed Pao Ch'ai smiling, "the good fortune, cousinPao-y�, of having daily opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of everykind of subject, and yet don't you know that the properties of wine aremostly heating? If you drink wine warm, its effects soon dispel, but ifyou drink it cold, it at once congeals in you; and as upon yourintestines devolves the warming of it, how can you not derive any harm?and won't you yet from this time change this habit of yours? leave offat once drinking that cold wine."
Pao-y� finding that the words he had heard contained a good deal ofsense, speedily put down the cold wine, and having asked them to warmit, he at length drank it.
Tai-y� was bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing but simplypursing up her lips and smiling, when, strange coincidence, Hs�eh Yen,Tai-y�'s waiting-maid, walked in and handed her mistress a smallhand-stove.
"Who told you to bring it?" ascertained Tai-y� grinningly. "I'm sorry tohave given whoever it is the trouble; I'm obliged to her. But did sheever imagine that I would freeze to death?"
"Tzu Chuan was afraid," replied Hs�eh Yen, "that you would, miss, feelcold, and she asked me to bring it over."
Tai-y� took it over and held it in her lap. "How is it," she smiled,"that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what I say,day after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! How is it thatyou at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than youwould an imperial edict?"
When Pao-y� heard this, he felt sure in his mind that Tai-y� wasavailing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made noremark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice. PaoCh'ai, again, knew full well that this habit was a weak point withTai-y�, so she too did not go out of her way to heed what she said.
"You've always been delicate and unable to stand the cold," interposed"aunt" Hs�eh, "and is it not a kind attention on their part to havethought of you?"
"You don't know, aunt, how it really stands," responded Tai-y�smilingly; "fortunately enough, it was sent to me here at your quarters;for had it been in any one else's house, wouldn't it have been a slightupon them? Is it forsooth nice to think that people haven't so much as ahand-stove, and that one has fussily to be sent over from home? Peoplewon't say that the waiting-maids are too officious, but will imaginethat I'm in the habit of behaving in this offensive fashion."
"You're far too punctilious," remarked Mrs. Hs�eh, "as to entertain suchnotions! No such ideas as these crossed my mind just now."
While they were conversing, Pao-y� had taken so much as three cups ofwine, and nurse Li came forward again to prevent him from having anymore. Pao-y� was just then in a state of exultation and excitement, (astate) enhanced by the conversation and laughter of his cousins, so thatwas he ready to agree to having no more! But he was constrained in ahumble spirit to entreat for permission. "My dear nurse," he implored,"I'll just take two more cups and then have no more."
"You'd better be careful," added nurse Li, "your father is at hometo-day, and see that you're ready to be examined in your lessons."
When Pao-y� heard this mention, his spirits at once sank within him, andgently putting the wine aside, he dropped his head upon his breast.
Tai-y� promptly remonstrated. "You've thrown cold water," she said,"over the spirits of the whole company; why, if uncle should ask to seeyou, well, say that aunt Hs�eh detained you. This old nurse of yours hasbeen drinking, and again makes us the means of clearing her muddledhead!"
While saying this, she gave Pao-y� a big nudge with the intent ofstirring up his spirits, adding, as she addressed him in a low tone ofvoice: "Don't let us heed that old thing, but mind our own enjoyment."
Dame Li also knew very well Tai-y�'s disposition, and thereforeremarked: "Now, Miss Lin, don't you urge him on; you should after all,give him good advice, as he may, I think, listen to a good deal of whatyou say to him."
"Why should I urge him on?" rejoined Lin Tai-y�, with a sarcastic smile,"nor will I trouble myself to give him advice. You, old lady, are fartoo scrupulous! Old lady Chia has also time after time given him wine,and if he now takes a cup or two more here, at his aunt's, lady Hs�eh'shouse, there's no harm that I can see. Is it perhaps, who knows, thataunt is a stranger in this establishment, and that we have in fact noright to come over here to see her?"
Nurse Li was both vexed and amused by the words she had just heard."Really," she observed, "every remark this girl Lin utters is sharperthan a razor! I didn't say anything much!"
Pao Ch'ai too could not suppress a smile, and as she pinched Tai-y�'scheek, she exclaimed, "Oh the tongue of this frowning girl! one canneither resent what it says, nor yet listen to it with anygratification!"
"Don't be afraid!" Mrs. Hs�eh went on to say, "don't be afraid; my son,you've come to see me, and although I've nothing good to give you, youmustn't, through fright, let the trifle you've taken lie heavy on yourstomach, and thus make me uneasy; but just drink at your pleasure, andas much as you like, and let the blame fall on my shoulders. What'smore, you can stay to dinner with me, and then go home; or if you do gettipsy, you can sleep with me, that's all."
She thereupon told the servants to heat some more wine. "I'll come," shecontinued, "and keep you company while you have two or three cups, afterwhich we'll have something to eat!"
It was only after these assurances that Pao-y�'s spirits began atlength, once more to revive, and dame Li then directed the waiting-maidswhat to do. "You remain here," she enjoined, "and mind, be diligentwhile I go home and change; when I'll come back again. Don't allow him,"she also whispered to "aunt" Hs�eh, "to have all his own way and drinktoo much."
Having said this, she betook herself back to her quarters; and duringthis while, though there were two or three nurses in attendance, theydid not concern themselves with what was going on. As soon as they sawthat nurse Li had left, they likewise all quietly slipped out, at thefirst opportunity they found, while there remained but twowaiting-maids, who were only too glad to curry favour with Pao-y�. Butfortunately "aunt" Hs�eh, by much coaxing and persuading, only let himhave a few cups, and the wine being then promptly cleared away, pickledbamboo shoots and chicken-skin soup were prepared, of which Pao-y� drankwith relish several bowls full, eating besides more than half a bowl offinest rice congee.
By this time, Hs�eh Pao Ch'ai and Lin Tai-y� had also finished theirrepast; and when Pao-y� had drunk a few cups of strong tea, Mrs. Hs�ehfelt more easy in her mind. Hs�eh Yen and the others, three or four ofthem in all, had also had their meal, and came in to wait upon them.
"Are you now going or not?" inquired Tai-y� of Pao-y�.
Pao-y� looked askance with his drowsy eyes. "If you want to go," heobserved, "I'll go with you."
Tai-y� hearing this, speedily rose. "We've been here nearly the wholeday," she said, "and ought to be going back."
As she spoke the two of them bade good-bye, and the waiting-maids atonce presented a hood to each of them.
Pao-y� readily lowered his head slightly and told a waiting-maid to putit on. The girl promptly took the hood, made of deep red cloth, andshaking it out of its folds, she put it on Pao-y�'s head.
"That will do," hastily exclaimed Pao-y�. "You stupid thing! gently abit; is it likely you've never seen any one put one on before? let me doit myself."
"Come over here, and I'll put it on for you," suggested Tai-y�, as shestood on the edge of the couch. Pao-y� eagerly approached her, andTai-y� carefully kept the cap, to which his hair was bound, fast down,and taking the hood she rested its edge on the circlet round hisforehead. She then raised the ball of crimson velvet, which was as largeas a walnut, and put it in such a way that, as it waved tremulously, itshould appear outside the hood. These arrangements completed she cast alook for a while at what she had done. "That's right now," she added,"throw your wrapper over you!"
When Pao-y� caught these words, he eventually took the wrapper and threwit over his shoulders.
"None of your nurses," hurriedly interposed aunt Hs�eh, "are yet come,so you had better wait a while."
"Why should we wait for them?" observed Pao-y�. "We have thewaiting-maids to escort us, and surely they should be enough."
Mrs. Hs�eh finding it difficult to set her mind at ease deputed twomarried women to accompany the two cousins; and after they had bothexpressed (to these women) their regret at having troubled them, theycame straightway to dowager lady Chia's suite of apartments.
Her venerable ladyship had not, as yet, had her evening repast. Hearingthat they had been at Mrs. Hs�eh's, she was extremely pleased; butnoticing that Pao-y� had had some wine, she gave orders that he shouldbe taken to his room, and put to bed, and not be allowed to come outagain.
"Do take good care of him," she therefore enjoined the servants, andwhen suddenly she bethought herself of Pao-y�'s attendants, "How is it,"she at once inquired of them all, "that I don't see nurse Li here?"
They did not venture to tell her the truth, that she had gone home, butsimply explained that she had come in a few moments back, and that theythought she must have again gone out on some business or other.
"She's better off than your venerable ladyship," remarked Pao-y�,turning round and swaying from side to side. "Why then ask after her?Were I rid of her, I believe I might live a little longer."
While uttering these words, he reached the door of his bedroom, where hesaw pen and ink laid out on the writing table.
"That's nice," exclaimed Ch'ing Wen, as she came to meet him with asmile on her face, "you tell me to prepare the ink for you, but thoughwhen you get up, you were full of the idea of writing, you only wrotethree characters, when you discarded the pencil, and ran away, foolingme, by making me wait the whole day! Come now at once and exhaust allthis ink before you're let off."
Pao-y� then remembered what had taken place in the morning. "Where arethe three characters I wrote?" he consequently inquired, smiling.
"Why this man is tipsy," remarked Ch'ing Wen sneeringly. "As you weregoing to the other mansion, you told me to stick them over the door. Iwas afraid lest any one else should spoil them, as they were beingpasted, so I climbed up a high ladder and was ever so long in puttingthem up myself; my hands are even now numb with cold."
"Oh I forgot all about it," replied Pao-y� grinning, "if your hands arecold, come and I'll rub them warm for you."
Promptly stretching out his hand, he took those of Ch'ing Wen in his,and the two of them looked at the three characters, which he recentlyhad written, and which were pasted above the door. In a short while,Tai-y� came.
"My dear cousin," Pao-y� said to her smilingly, "tell me without anyprevarication which of the three characters is the best written?"
Tai-y� raised her head and perceived the three characters: Red, Rue,Hall. "They're all well done," she rejoined, with a smirk, "How is ityou've written them so well? By and bye you must also write a tablet forme."
"Are you again making fun of me?" asked Pao-y� smiling; "what aboutsister Hsi Jen?" he went on to inquire.
Ch'ing Wen pouted her lips, pointing towards the stove-couch in theinner room, and, on looking in, Pao-y� espied Hsi Jen fast asleep in herdaily costume.
"Well," Pao-y� observed laughing, "there's no harm in it, but its ratherearly to sleep. When I was having my early meal, on the other side," heproceeded, speaking to Ch'ing Wen, "there was a small dish of dumplings,with bean-curd outside; and as I thought you would like to have some, Iasked Mrs. Yu for them, telling her that I would keep them, and eat themin the evening; I told some one to bring them over, but have youperchance seen them?"
"Be quick and drop that subject," suggested Ch'ing Wen; "as soon as theywere brought over, I at once knew they were intended for me; as I hadjust finished my meal, I put them by in there, but when nurse Li cameshe saw them. 'Pao-y�,' she said, 'is not likely to eat them, so I'lltake them and give them to my grandson.' And forthwith she bade some onetake them over to her home."
While she was speaking, Hsi Hs�eh brought in tea, and Pao-y� pressed hiscousin Lin to have a cup.
"Miss Lin has gone long ago," observed all of them, as they burst outlaughing, "and do you offer her tea?"
Pao-y� drank about half a cup, when he also suddenly bethought himselfof some tea, which had been brewed in the morning. "This morning," hetherefore inquired of Hsi Hs�eh, "when you made a cup of maple-dew tea,I told you that that kind of tea requires brewing three or four timesbefore its colour appears; and how is that you now again bring me thistea?"
"I did really put it by," answered Hsi Hs�eh, "but nurse Li came anddrank it, and then went off."
Pao-y� upon hearing this, dashed the cup he held in his hand on theground, and as it broke into small fragments, with a crash, it spatteredHsi Hs�eh's petticoat all over.
"Of whose family is she the mistress?" inquired Pao-y� of Hsi Hs�eh, ashe jumped up, "that you all pay such deference to her. I just simply hada little of her milk, when I was a brat, and that's all; and now she hasgot into the way of thinking herself more high and mighty than even theheads of the family! She should be packed off, and then we shall allhave peace and quiet."
Saying this, he was bent upon going, there and then, to tell dowagerlady Chia to have his nurse driven away.
Hsi Jen was really not asleep, but simply feigning, with the idea, whenPao-y� came, to startle him in play. At first, when she heard him speakof writing, and inquire after the dumplings, she did not think itnecessary to get up, but when he flung the tea-cup on the floor, and gotinto a temper, she promptly jumped up and tried to appease him, and toprevent him by coaxing from carrying out his threat.
A waiting-maid sent by dowager lady Chia came in, meanwhile, to ask whatwas the matter.
"I had just gone to pour tea," replied Hsi Jen, without the leasthesitation, "and I slipped on the snow and fell, while the cup droppedfrom my hand and broke. Your decision to send her away is good," shewent on to advise Pao-y�, "and we are all willing to go also; and whynot avail yourself of this opportunity to dismiss us in a body? It willbe for our good, and you too on the other hand, needn't perplex yourselfabout not getting better people to come and wait on you!"
When Pao-y� heard this taunt, he had at length not a word to say, andsupported by Hsi Jen and the other attendants on to the couch, theydivested him of his clothes. But they failed to understand the drift ofwhat Pao-y� kept on still muttering, and all they could make out was anendless string of words; but his eyes grew heavier and drowsier, andthey forthwith waited upon him until he went to sleep; when Hsi Jenunclasped the jade of spiritual perception, and rolling it up in ahandkerchief, she lay it under the mattress, with the idea that when heput it on the next day it should not chill his neck.
Pao-y� fell sound asleep the moment he lay his head on the pillow. Bythis time nurse Li and the others had come in, but when they heard thatPao-y� was tipsy, they too did not venture to approach, but gently madeinquiries as to whether he was asleep or not. On hearing that he was,they took their departure with their minds more at ease.
The next morning the moment Pao-y� awoke, some one came in to tell himthat young Mr. Jung, living in the mansion on the other side, hadbrought Ch'in Chung to pay him a visit.
Pao-y� speedily went out to greet them and to take them over to paytheir respects to dowager lady Chia. Her venerable ladyship uponperceiving that Ch'in Chung, with his handsome countenance, and hisrefined manners, would be a fit companion for Pao-y� in his studies,felt extremely delighted at heart; and having readily detained him totea, and kept him to dinner, she went further and directed a servant toescort him to see madame Wang and the rest of the family.
With the fond regard of the whole household for Mrs. Ch'in, they were,when they saw what a kind of person Ch'in Chung was, so enchanted withhim, that at the time of his departure, they all had presents to givehim; even dowager lady Chia herself presented him with a purse and agolden image of the God of Learning, with a view that it should incitehim to study and harmony.
"Your house," she further advised him, "is far off, and when it's coldor hot, it would be inconvenient for you to come all that way, so youhad better come and live over here with me. You'll then be always withyour cousin Pao-y�, and you won't be together, in your studies, withthose fellow-pupils of yours who have no idea what progress means."
Ch'in Chung made a suitable answer to each one of her remarks, and onhis return home he told everything to his father.
His father, Ch'in Pang-yeh, held at present the post of Secretary in thePeking Field Force, and was well-nigh seventy. His wife had died at anearly period, and as she left no issue, he adopted a son and a daughterfrom a foundling asylum.
But who would have thought it, the boy also died, and there onlyremained the girl, known as K� Ch'ing in her infancy, who when she grewup, was beautiful in face and graceful in manners, and who by reason ofsome relationship with the Chia family, was consequently united by theties of marriage (to one of the household).
Ch'in Pang-yeh was in his fiftieth year when he at length got this son.As his tutor had the previous year left to go south, he remained at homekeeping up his former lessons; and (his father) had been just thinkingof talking over the matter with his relatives of the Chia family, andsending his son to the private school, when, as luck would have it, thisopportunity of meeting Pao-y� presented itself.
Knowing besides that the family school was under the direction of thevenerable scholar Chia Tai-ju, and hoping that by joining his class,(his son) might advance in knowledge and by these means reap reputation,he was therefore intensely gratified. The only drawbacks were that hisofficial emoluments were scanty, and that both the eyes of everyone inthe other establishment were set upon riches and honours, so that hecould not contribute anything short of the amount (given by others); buthis son's welfare throughout life was a serious consideration, and he,needless to say, had to scrape together from the East and to collectfrom the West; and making a parcel, with all deference, of twenty-fourtaels for an introduction present, he came along with Ch'in Chung toTai-ju's house to pay their respects. But he had to wait subsequentlyuntil Pao-y� could fix on an auspicious date on which they couldtogether enter the school.
As for what happened after they came to school, the next chapter willdivulge.

CHAPTER IX.
  Chia Cheng gives good advice to his wayward son.  Li Kuei receives a reprimand.  Chia Jui and Li Kuei rebuke the obstinate youths!  Ming Yen causes trouble in the school-room.
But to return to our story. Mr. Ch'in, the father, and Ch'in Chung, hisson, only waited until the receipt, by the hands of a servant, of aletter from the Chia family about the date on which they were to go toschool. Indeed, Pao-y� was only too impatient that he and Ch'in Chungshould come together, and, without loss of time, he fixed upon two dayslater as the day upon which they were definitely to begin their studies,and he despatched a servant with a letter to this effect.
On the day appointed, as soon as it was daylight, Pao-y� turned out ofbed. Hsi Jen had already by that time got books, pencils and all writingnecessaries in perfect readiness, and was sitting on the edge of the bedin a moping mood; but as soon as she saw Pao-y� approach, she wasconstrained to wait upon him in his toilette and ablutions.
Pao-y�, noticing how despondent she was, made it a point to address her."My dear sister," he said, "how is it you aren't again yourself? Is itlikely that you bear me a grudge for being about to go to school,because when I leave you, you'll all feel dull?"
Hsi Jen smiled. "What an ideal" she replied. "Study is a most excellentthing, and without it a whole lifetime is a mere waste, and what goodcomes in the long run? There's only one thing, which is simply that whenengaged in reading your books, you should set your mind on your books;and that you should think of home when not engaged in reading. Whateveryou do, don't romp together with them, for were you to meet our master,your father, it will be no joke! Although it's asserted that a scholarmust strain every nerve to excel, yet it's preferable that the tasksshould be somewhat fewer, as, in the first place, when one eats toomuch, one cannot digest it; and, in the second place, good health mustalso be carefully attended to. This is my view on the subject, and youshould at all times consider it in practice."
While Hsi Jen gave utterance to a sentence, Pao-y� nodded his head insign of approval of that sentence. Hsi Jen then went on to speak. "I'vealso packed up," she continued, "your long pelisse, and handed it to thepages to take it over; so mind, when it's cold in the school-room,please remember to put on this extra clothing, for it's not like home,where you have people to look after you. The foot-stove and hand-stove,I've also sent over; and urge that pack of lazy-bones to attend to theirwork, for if you say nothing, they will be so engrossed in theirfrolics, that they'll be loth to move, and let you, all for nothing,take a chill and ruin your constitution."
"Compose your mind," replied Pao-y�; "when I go out, I know well enoughhow to attend to everything my own self. But you people shouldn't remainin this room, and mope yourselves to death; and it would be well if youwould often go over to cousin Lin's for a romp."
While saying this, he had completed his toilette, and Hsi Jen pressedhim to go and wish good morning to dowager lady Chia, Chia Cheng, madameWang, and the other members of the family.
Pao-y�, after having gone on to give a few orders to Ch'ing Wen and SheYueh, at length left his apartments, and coming over, paid his obeisanceto dowager lady Chia. Her venerable Ladyship had likewise, as a matterof course, a few recommendations to make to him, which ended, he nextwent and greeted madame Wang; and leaving again her quarters, he cameinto the library to wish Chia Cheng good morning.
As it happened, Chia Cheng had on this day returned home at an earlyhour, and was, at this moment, in the library, engaged in a friendlychat with a few gentlemen, who were family companions. Suddenlyperceiving Pao-y� come in to pay his respects, and report that he wasabout to go to school, Chia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. "If you doagain," he remarked, "make allusions to the words going to school,you'll make even me blush to death with shame! My advice to you is thatyou should after all go your own way and play; that's the best thing foryou; and mind you don't pollute with dirt this floor by standing here,and soil this door of mine by leaning against it!"
The family companions stood up and smilingly expostulated.
"Venerable Sir," they pleaded, "why need you be so down upon him? Ourworthy brother is this day going to school, and may in two or threeyears be able to display his abilities and establish his reputation. Hewill, beyond doubt, not behave like a child, as he did in years gonepast. But as the time for breakfast is also drawing nigh, you should,worthy brother, go at once."
When these words had been spoken, two among them, who were advanced inyears, readily took Pao-y� by the hand, and led him out of the library.
"Who are in attendance upon Pao-y�?" Chia Cheng having inquired, heheard a suitable reply, "We, Sir!" given from outside; and three or foursturdy fellows entered at an early period and fell on one knee, andbowed and paid their obeisance.
When Chia Cheng came to scrutinise who they were, and he recognised LiKuei, the son of Pao-y�'s nurse, he addressed himself to him. "Youpeople," he said, "remain waiting upon him the whole day long at school,but what books has he after all read? Books indeed! why, he has read andfilled his brains with a lot of trashy words and nonsensical phrases,and learnt some ingenious way of waywardness. Wait till I have a littleleisure, and I'll set to work, first and foremost, and flay your skinoff, and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing!"
This threat so terrified Li Kuei that he hastily fell on both his knees,pulled off his hat, knocked his head on the ground, and gave vent torepeated assenting utterances: "Oh, quite so, Sir! Our elder brother Mr.Pao has," he continued, "already read up to the third book of the Bookof Odes, up to where there's something or other like: 'Yiu, Yiu, thedeer bleat; the lotus leaves and duckweed.' Your servant wouldn'tpresume to tell a lie!"
As he said this, the whole company burst out into a boisterous fit oflaughter, and Chia Cheng himself could not also contain his countenanceand had to laugh. "Were he even," he observed, "to read thirty books ofthe Book of Odes, it would be as much an imposition upon people and nomore, as (when the thief) who, in order to steal the bell, stops up hisown ears! You go and present my compliments to the gentleman in theschoolroom, and tell him, from my part, that the whole lot of Odes andold writings are of no use, as they are subjects for empty show; andthat he should, above all things, take the Four Books, and explain themto him, from first to last, and make him know them all thoroughly byheart,--that this is the most important thing!"
Li Kuei signified his obedience with all promptitude, and perceivingthat Chia Cheng had nothing more to say, he retired out of the room.
During this while, Pao-y� had been standing all alone outside in thecourt, waiting quietly with suppressed voice, and when they came out heat once walked away in their company.
Li Kuei and his companions observed as they shook their clothes, "Didyou, worthy brother, hear what he said that he would first of all flayour skins off! People's servants acquire some respectability from themaster whom they serve, but we poor fellows fruitlessly wait upon you,and are beaten and blown up in the bargain. It would be well if we were,from henceforward, to be treated with a certain amount of regard."
Pao-y� smiled, "Dear Brother," he added, "don't feel aggrieved; I'llinvite you to come round to-morrow!"
"My young ancestor," replied Li Kuei, "who presumes to look forward toan invitation? all I entreat you is to listen to one or two words I haveto say, that's all."
As they talked they came over once more to dowager lady Chia's on thisside.
Ch'in Chung had already arrived, and the old lady was first having achat with him. Forthwith the two of them exchanged salutations, and tookleave of her ladyship; but Pao-y�, suddenly remembering that he had notsaid good-bye to Tai-y�, promptly betook himself again to Tai-y�'squarters to do so.
Tai-y� was, at this time, below the window, facing the mirror, andadjusting her toilette. Upon hearing Pao-y� mention that he was on hisway to school, she smiled and remarked, "That's right! you're now goingto school and you'll be sure to reach the lunar palace and pluck theolea fragrans; but I can't go along with you."
"My dear cousin," rejoined Pao-y�, "wait for me to come out from school,before you have your evening meal; wait also until I come to prepare thecosmetic of rouge."
After a protracted chat, he at length tore himself away and took hisdeparture.
"How is it," interposed Tai-y�, as she once again called out to him andstopped him, "that you don't go and bid farewell to your cousin PaoCh'ai?"
Pao-y� smiled, and saying not a word by way of reply he straightwaywalked to school, accompanied by Ch'in Chung.
This public school, which it must be noticed was also not far from hisquarters, had been originally instituted by the founder of theestablishment, with the idea that should there be among the youngfellows of his clan any who had not the means to engage a tutor, theyshould readily be able to enter this class for the prosecution of theirstudies; that all those of the family who held official position shouldall give (the institution) pecuniary assistance, with a view to meet theexpenses necessary for allowances to the students; and that they were toselect men advanced in years and possessed of virtue to act as tutors ofthe family school.
The two of them, Ch'in Chung and Pao-y�, had now entered the class, andafter they and the whole number of their schoolmates had made eachother's acquaintance, their studies were commenced. Ever since thistime, these two were wont to come together, go together, get uptogether, and sit together, till they became more intimate and close.Besides, dowager lady Chia got very fond of Ch'in Chung, and would againand again keep him to stay with them for three and five days at a time,treating him as if he were one of her own great-grandsons. Perceivingthat in Ch'in Chung's home there was not much in the way of sufficiency,she also helped him in clothes and other necessaries; and scarcely hadone or two months elapsed before Ch'in Chung got on friendly terms withevery one in the Jung mansion.
Pao-y� was, however, a human being who could not practise contentmentand observe propriety; and as his sole delight was to have every capricegratified, he naturally developed a craving disposition. "We two, youand I, are," he was also wont secretly to tell Ch'in Chung, "of the sameage, and fellow-scholars besides, so that there's no need in the futureto pay any regard to our relationship of uncle and nephew; and we shouldtreat each other as brothers or friends, that's all."
Ch'in Chung at first (explained that) he could not be so presumptuous;but as Pao-y� would not listen to any such thing, but went on to addresshim as brother and to call him by his style Ch'ing Ch'ing, he hadlikewise himself no help, but to begin calling him, at random, anythingand anyhow.
There were, it is true, a large number of pupils in this school, butthese consisted of the sons and younger brothers of that same clan, andof several sons and nephews of family connections. The proverbappositely describes that there are nine species of dragons, and thateach species differs; and it goes of course without saying that in alarge number of human beings there were dragons and snakes, confusedlyadmixed, and that creatures of a low standing were included.
Ever since the arrival of the two young fellows, Ch'in Chung and Pao-y�,both of whom were in appearance as handsome as budding flowers, andthey, on the one hand, saw how modest and genial Ch'in Chung was, how heblushed before he uttered a word, how he was timid and demure like agirl, and on the other hand, how that Pao-y� was naturally proficient inabasing and demeaning himself, how he was so affable and good-natured,considerate in his temperament and so full of conversation, and how thatthese two were, in consequence, on such terms of intimate friendship, itwas, in fact, no matter of surprise that the whole company offellow-students began to foster envious thoughts, that they, behindtheir backs, passed on their account, this one one disparaging remarkand that one another, and that they insinuated slanderous lies againstthem, which extended inside as well as outside the school-room.
Indeed, after Hs�eh P'an had come over to take up his quarters in madameWang's suite of apartments, he shortly came to hear of the existence ofa family school, and that this school was mainly attended by youngfellows of tender years, and inordinate ideas were suddenly aroused inhim. While he therefore fictitiously gave out that he went to school,[he was as irregular in his attendance as the fisherman] who catchesfish for three days, and suns his nets for the next two; simplypresenting his school-fee gift to Chia Tai-jui and making not the leastprogress in his studies; his sole dream being to knit a number offamiliar friendships. Who would have thought it, there were in thisschool young pupils, who, in their greed to obtain money, clothes andeatables from Hs�eh P'an, allowed themselves to be cajoled by him, andplayed tricks upon; but on this topic, it is likewise superfluous todilate at any length.
There were also two lovable young scholars, relatives of what branch ofthe family is not known, and whose real surnames and names have also notbeen ascertained, who, by reason of their good and winsome looks, were,by the pupils in the whole class, given two nicknames, to one that of"Hsiang Lin," "Fragrant Love," and to the other "Y� Ai," "PreciousAffection." But although every one entertained feelings of secretadmiration for them, and had the wish to take liberties with the youngfellows, they lived, nevertheless, one and all, in such terror of Hs�ehP'an's imperious influence, that they had not the courage to comeforward and interfere with them.
As soon as Ch'in Chung and Pao-y� had, at this time, come to school, andthey had made the acquaintance of these two fellow-pupils, they toocould not help becoming attached to them and admiring them, but as theyalso came to know that they were great friends of Hs�eh P'an, they didnot, in consequence, venture to treat them lightly, or to be unseemly intheir behaviour towards them. Hsiang Lin and Y� Ai both kept tothemselves the same feelings, which they fostered for Ch'in Chung andPao-y�, and to this reason is to be assigned the fact that though thesefour persons nurtured fond thoughts in their hearts there was however novisible sign of them. Day after day, each one of them would, duringschool hours, sit in four distinct places: but their eight eyes weresecretly linked together; and, while indulging either in innuendoes orin double entendres, their hearts, in spite of the distance betweenthem, reflected the whole number of their thoughts.
But though their outward attempts were devoted to evade the detection ofother people's eyes, it happened again that, while least expected,several sly lads discovered the real state of affairs, with the resultthat the whole school stealthily frowned their eyebrows at them, winkedtheir eyes at them, or coughed at them, or raised their voices at them;and these proceedings were, in fact, not restricted to one single day.
As luck would have it, on this day Tai-jui was, on account of business,compelled to go home; and having left them as a task no more than aheptameter line for an antithetical couplet, explaining that they shouldfind a sentence to rhyme, and that the following day when he came back,he would set them their lessons, he went on to hand the affairsconnected with the class to his elder grandson, Chia Jui, whom he askedto take charge.
Wonderful to say Hs�eh P'an had of late not frequented school veryoften, not even so much as to answer the roll, so that Ch'in Chungavailed himself of his absence to ogle and smirk with Hsiang Lin; andthese two pretending that they had to go out, came into the back courtfor a chat.
"Does your worthy father at home mind your having any friends?" Ch'inChung was the first to ask. But this sentence was scarcely ended, whenthey heard a sound of coughing coming from behind. Both were taken muchaback, and, speedily turning their heads round to see, they found thatit was a fellow-scholar of theirs, called Chin Jung.
Hsiang Lin was naturally of somewhat hasty temperament, so that withshame and anger mutually impelling each other, he inquired of him,"What's there to cough at? Is it likely you wouldn't have us speak toeach other?"
"I don't mind your speaking," Chin Jung observed laughing; "but wouldyou perchance not have me cough? I'll tell you what, however; if youhave anything to say, why not utter it in intelligible language? Wereyou allowed to go on in this mysterious manner, what strange doingswould you be up to? But I have sure enough found you out, so what's theneed of still prevaricating? But if you will, first of all, let mepartake of a share in your little game, you and I can hold our tongueand utter not a word. If not, why the whole school will begin to turnthe matter over."
At these words, Ch'in Chung and Hsiang Lin were so exasperated thattheir blood rushed up to their faces. "What have you found out?" theyhastily asked.
"What I have now detected," replied Chin Jung smiling, "is the plaintruth!" and saying this he went on to clap his hands and to call outwith a loud voice as he laughed: "They have moulded some nice well-bakedcakes, won't you fellows come and buy one to eat!" (These two have beenup to larks, won't you come and have some fun!)
Both Ch'in Chung and Hsiang Lin felt resentful as well as fuming withrage, and with hurried step they went in, in search of Chia Jui, to whomthey reported Chin Jung, explaining that Chin Jung had insulted themboth, without any rhyme or reason.
The fact is that this Chia Jui was, in an extraordinary degree, a manwith an eye to the main chance, and devoid of any sense of propriety.His wont was at school to take advantage of public matters to serve hisprivate interest, and to bring pressure upon his pupils with the intentthat they should regale him. While subsequently he also lent hiscountenance to Hs�eh P'an, scheming to get some money or eatables out ofhim, he left him entirely free to indulge in disorderly behaviour; andnot only did he not go out of his way to hold him in check, but, on thecontrary, he encouraged him, infamous though he was already, to become abully, so as to curry favour with him.
But this Hs�eh P'an was, by nature, gifted with a fickle disposition;to-day, he would incline to the east, and to-morrow to the west, so thathaving recently obtained new friends, he put Hsiang Lin and Y� Ai aside.Chin Jung too was at one time an intimate friend of his, but ever sincehe had acquired the friendship of the two lads, Hsiang Lin and Y� Ai, heforthwith deposed Chin Jung. Of late, he had already come to look downupon even Hsiang Lin and Y� Ai, with the result that Chia Jui as wellwas deprived of those who could lend him support, or stand by him; buthe bore Hs�eh P'an no grudge, for wearying with old friends, as soon ashe found new ones, but felt angry that Hsiang Lin and Y� Ai had not putin a word on his behalf with Hs�eh P'an. Chia Jui, Chin Jung and in factthe whole crowd of them were, for this reason, just harbouring a jealousgrudge against these two, so that when he saw Ch'in Chung and Hsiang Lincome on this occasion and lodge a complaint against Chin Jung, Chia Juireadily felt displeasure creep into his heart; and, although he did notventure to call Ch'in Chung to account, he nevertheless made an exampleof Hsiang Lin. And instead (of taking his part), he called him abusybody and denounced him in much abusive language, with the resultthat Hsiang Lin did not, contrariwise, profit in any way, but broughtdispleasure upon himself. Even Ch'in Chung grumbled against thetreatment, as each of them resumed their places.
Chin Jung became still more haughty, and wagging his head and smackinghis lips, he gave vent to many more abusive epithets; but as it happenedthat they also reached Y� Ai's ears, the two of them, though seatedapart, began an altercation in a loud tone of voice.
Chin Jung, with obstinate pertinacity, clung to his version. "Just ashort while back," he said, "I actually came upon them, as they wereindulging in demonstrations of intimate friendship in the back court.These two had resolved to be one in close friendship, and were eloquentin their protestations, mindful only in persistently talking theirtrash, but they were not aware of the presence of another person."
But his language had, contrary to all expectations, given, from the veryfirst, umbrage to another person, and who do you, (gentle reader,)imagine this person to have been?
This person was, in fact, one whose name was Chia Se; a grandsonlikewise of a main branch of the Ning mansion. His parents had died atan early period, and he had, ever since his youth, lived with Chia Chen.He had at this time grown to be sixteen years of age, and was, ascompared with Chia Jung, still more handsome and good looking. These twocousins were united by ties of the closest intimacy, and were alwaystogether, whether they went out or stayed at home.
The inmates of the Ning mansion were many in number, and their opinionsof a mixed kind; and that whole bevy of servants, devoid as they were ofall sense of right, solely excelled in the practice of inventing storiesto backbite their masters; and this is how some mean person or otheragain, who it was is not known, insinuated slanderous and opprobriousreports (against Chia Se). Chia Chen had, presumably, also come to hearsome unfavourable criticisms (on his account), and having, of course, tosave himself from odium and suspicion, he had, at this juncture, afterall, to apportion him separate quarters, and to bid Chia Se move outsidethe Ning mansion, where he went and established a home of his own tolive in.
This Chia Se was handsome as far as external appearances went, andintelligent withal in his inward natural gifts, but, though he nominallycame to school, it was simply however as a mere blind; for he treated,as he had ever done, as legitimate occupations, such things as cockfighting, dog-racing and visiting places of easy virtue. And as, above,he had Chia Chen to spoil him by over-indulgence; and below, there wasChia Jung to stand by him, who of the clan could consequently presume torun counter to him?
Seeing that he was on the closest terms of friendship with Chia Jung,how could he reconcile himself to the harsh treatment which he now sawCh'in Chung receive from some persons? Being now bent upon pushinghimself forward to revenge the injustice, he was, for the time, givinghimself up to communing with his own heart. "Chin Jung, Chia Jui and therest are," he pondered, "friends of uncle Hs�eh, but I too am onfriendly terms with him, and he with me, and if I do come forward andthey tell old Hs�eh, won't we impair the harmony which exists betweenus? and if I don't concern myself, such idle tales make, when spoken,every one feel uncomfortable; and why shouldn't I now devise some meansto hold them in check, so as to stop their mouths, and prevent any lossof face!"
Having concluded this train of thought, he also pretended that he had togo out, and, walking as far as the back, he, with low voice, called tohis side Ming Yen, the page attending upon Pao-y� in his studies, and inone way and another, he made use of several remarks to egg him on.
This Ming Yen was the smartest of Pao-y�'s attendants, but he was alsoyoung in years and lacked experience, so that he lent a patient ear towhat Chia Se had to say about the way Chin Jung had insulted Ch'inChung. "Even your own master, Pao-y�," (Chia Se added), "is involved,and if you don't let him know a bit of your mind, he will next time bestill more arrogant."
This Ming Yen was always ready, even with no valid excuse, to beinsolent and overbearing to people, so that after hearing the news andbeing furthermore instigated by Chia Se, he speedily rushed into theschoolroom and cried out "Chin Jung;" nor did he address him as Mr.Chin, but merely shouted "What kind of fellow is this called Chin?"
Chia Se presently shuffled his feet, while he designedly adjusted hisdress and looked at the rays of the sun. "It's time," he observed andwalking forthwith, first up to Chia Jui, he explained to him that he hadsomething to attend to and would like to get away a little early; and asChia Jui did not venture to stop him, he had no alternative but to lethim have his way and go.
During this while, Ming Yen had entered the room and promptly seizingChin Jung in a grip: "What we do, whether proper or improper," he said,"doesn't concern you! It's enough anyway that we don't defile yourfather! A fine brat you are indeed, to come out and meddle with your Mr.Ming!"
These words plunged the scholars of the whole class in suchconsternation that they all wistfully and absently looked at him.
"Ming Yen," hastily shouted out Chia Jui, "you're not to kick up arumpus."
Chin Jung was so full of anger that his face was quite yellow. "What asubversion of propriety! a slave and a menial to venture to behave inthis manner! I'll just simply speak to your master," he exclaimed as hereadily pushed his hands off and was about to go and lay hold of Pao-y�to beat him.
Ch'in Chung was on the point of turning round to leave the room, whenwith a sound of 'whiff' which reached him from behind, he at once caughtsight of a square inkslab come flying that way. Who had thrown it hecould not say, but it struck the desk where Chia Lan and Chia Ch�n wereseated.
These two, Chia Lan and Chia Ch�n, were also the great-grandsons of aclose branch of the Jung mansion. This Chia Ch�n had been leftfatherless at an early age, and his mother doated upon him in an unusualmanner, and it was because at school he was on most friendly terms withChia Lan, that these two sat together at the same desk. Who would havebelieved that Chia Ch�n would, in spite of being young in years, havehad an extremely strong mind, and that he would be mostly up to mischiefwithout the least fear of any one. He watched with listless eye from hisseat Chin Jung's friends stealthily assist Chin Jung, as they flung aninkslab to strike Ming Yen, but when, as luck would have it, it hit thewrong mark, and fell just in front of him, smashing to atoms theporcelain inkslab and water bottle, and smudging his whole book withink, Chia Ch�n was, of course, much incensed, and hastily gave way toabuse. "You consummate pugnacious criminal rowdies! why, doesn't thisamount to all of you taking a share in the fight!" And as he utteredthis abuse, he too forthwith seized an inkslab, which he was bent uponflinging.
Chia Lan was one who always tried to avoid trouble, so that he lost notime in pressing down the inkslab, while with all the words his mouthcould express, he tried to pacify him, adding "My dear brother, it's nobusiness of yours and mine."
Chia Ch�n could not repress his resentment; and perceiving that theinkslab was held down, he at once laid hold of a box containing books,which he flung in this direction; but being, after all, short ofstature, and weak of strength, he was unable to send it anywhere nearthe mark; so that it dropped instead when it got as far as the deskbelonging to Pao-y� and Ch'in Chung, while a dreadful crash becameaudible as it fell smash on the table. The books, papers, pencils,inkslabs, and other writing materials were all scattered over the wholetable; and Pao-y�'s cup besides containing tea was itself broken topieces and the tea spilt.
Chia Ch�n forthwith jumped forward with the intent of assailing theperson who had flung the inkslab at the very moment that Chin Jung tookhold of a long bamboo pole which was near by; but as the space waslimited, and the pupils many, how could he very well brandish a longstick? Ming Yen at an early period received a whack, and he shoutedwildly, "Don't you fellows yet come to start a fight."
Pao-y� had, besides, along with him several pages, one of whom wascalled Sao Hung, another Ch'u Yo, another Mo Y�. These three werenaturally up to every mischief, so that with one voice, bawlingboisterously, "You children of doubtful mothers, have you taken uparms?" Mo Y� promptly took up the bar of a door; while Sao Hung and Ch'uYo both laid hold of horsewhips, and they all rushed forward like a hiveof bees.
Chia Jui was driven to a state of exasperation; now he kept this one incheck, and the next moment he reasoned with another, but who wouldlisten to his words? They followed the bent of their inclinations andstirred up a serious disturbance.
Of the whole company of wayward young fellows, some there were who gavesly blows for fun's sake; others there were who were not gifted withmuch pluck and hid themselves on one side; there were those too whostood on the tables, clapping their hands and laughing immoderately,shouting out: "Go at it."
The row was, at this stage, like water bubbling over in a cauldron, whenseveral elderly servants, like Li Kuei and others, who stood outside,heard the uproar commence inside, and one and all came in with all hasteand united in their efforts to pacify them. Upon asking "What's thematter?" the whole bevy of voices shouted out different versions; thisone giving this account, while another again another story. But Li Kueitemporised by rebuking Ming Yen and others, four in all, and packingthem off.
Ch'in Chung's head had, at an early period, come into contact with ChinJung's pole and had had the skin grazed off. Pao-y� was in the act ofrubbing it for him, with the overlap of his coat, but realising that thewhole lot of them had been hushed up, he forthwith bade Li Kuei collecthis books.
"Bring my horse round," he cried; "I'm going to tell Mr. Chia Tai-juthat we have been insulted. I won't venture to tell him anything else,but (tell him I will) that having come with all propriety and made ourreport to Mr. Chia Jui, Mr. Chia Jui instead (of helping us) threw thefault upon our shoulders. That while he heard people abuse us, he wentso far as to instigate them to beat us; that Ming Yen seeing othersinsult us, did naturally take our part; but that they, instead (ofdesisting,) combined together and struck Ming Yen and even broke openCh'in Chung's head. And that how is it possible for us to continue ourstudies in here?"
"My dear sir," replied Li Kuei coaxingly, "don't be so impatient! As Mr.Chia Tai-ju has had something to attend to and gone home, were you now,for a trifle like this, to go and disturb that aged gentleman, it willmake us, indeed, appear as if we had no sense of propriety: my idea isthat wherever a thing takes place, there should it be settled; andwhat's the need of going and troubling an old man like him. This is allyou, Mr. Chia Jui, who is to blame; for in the absence of Mr. ChiaTai-ju, you, sir, are the head in this school, and every one looks toyou to take action. Had all the pupils been at fault, those who deserveda beating should have been beaten, and those who merited punishmentshould have been punished! and why did you wait until things came tosuch a pass, and didn't even exercise any check?"
"I blew them up," pleaded Chia Jui, "but not one of them would listen."
"I'll speak out, whether you, worthy sir, resent what I'm going to sayor not," ventured Li Kuei. "It's you, sir, who all along have after allhad considerable blame attached to your name; that's why all these youngmen wouldn't hear you! Now if this affair is bruited, until it reachesMr. Chia Tai-ju's ears, why even you, sir, will not be able to escapecondemnation; and why don't you at once make up your mind to disentanglethe ravelled mess and dispel all trouble and have done with it!"
"Disentangle what?" inquired Pao-y�; "I shall certainly go and make myreport."
"If Chin Jung stays here," interposed Ch'in Chung sobbing, "I mean to goback home."
"Why that?" asked Pao-y�. "Is it likely that others can safely come andthat you and I can't? I feel it my bounden duty to tell every oneeverything at home so as to expel Chin Jung. This Chin Jung," he went onto inquire as he turned towards Lei Kuei, "is the relative or friend ofwhat branch of the family?"
Li Kuei gave way to reflection and then said by way of reply: "There'sno need whatever for you to raise this question; for were you to go andreport the matter to the branch of the family to which he belongs, theharmony which should exist between cousins will be still more impaired."
"He's the nephew of Mrs. Huang, of the Eastern mansion," interposed MingYen from outside the window. "What a determined and self-confidentfellow he must be to even come and bully us; Mrs. Huang is his paternalaunt! That mother of yours is only good for tossing about like amillstone, for kneeling before our lady Lien, and begging for somethingto pawn. I've no eye for such a specimen of mistress."
"What!" speedily shouted Li Kuei, "does this son of a dog happen to knowof the existence of all these gnawing maggots?" (these disparagingfacts).
Pao-y� gave a sardonic smile. "I was wondering whose relative he was,"he remarked; "is he really sister-in-law Huang's nephew? well, I'll goat once and speak to her."
As he uttered these words, his purpose was to start there and then, andhe called Ming Yen in, to come and pack up his books. Ming Yen walked inand put the books away. "Master," he went on to suggest, in an exultantmanner, "there's no need for you to go yourself to see her; I'll go toher house and tell her that our old lady has something to ask of her. Ican hire a carriage to bring her over, and then, in the presence of hervenerable ladyship, she can be spoken to; and won't this way save a lotof trouble?"
"Do you want to die?" speedily shouted Li Kuei; "mind, when you go back,whether right or wrong, I'll first give you a good bumping, and then goand report you to our master and mistress, and just tell them that it'syou, and only you, who instigated Mr. Pao-y�! I've succeeded, after everso much trouble, in coaxing them, and mending matters to a certainextent, and now you come again to continue a new plan. It's you whostirred up this row in the school-room; and not to speak of yourfinding, as would have been the proper course, some way of suppressingit, there you are instead still jumping into the fire."
Ming Yen, at this juncture, could not muster the courage to utter asound. By this time Chia Jui had also apprehended that if the row cameto be beyond clearing up, he himself would likewise not be clear ofblame, so that circumstances compelled him to pocket his grievances andto come and entreat Ch'in Chung as well as to make apologies to Pao-y�.These two young fellows would not at first listen to his advances, butPao-y� at length explained that he would not go and report theoccurrence, provided only Chin Jung admitted his being in the wrong.Chin Jung refused, at the outset, to agree to this, but he ultimatelycould find no way out of it, as Chia Jui himself urged him to make sometemporising apology.
Li Kuei and the others felt compelled to tender Chin Jung some goodadvice: "It's you," they said, "who have given rise to the disturbance,and if you don't act in this manner, how will the matter ever be broughtto an end?" so that Chin Jung found it difficult to persist in hisobstinacy, and was constrained to make a bow to Ch'in Chung.
Pao-y� was, however, not yet satisfied, but would insist upon hisknocking his head on the ground, and Chia Jui, whose sole aim was totemporarily smother the affair, quietly again urged Chin Jung, addingthat the proverb has it: "That if you keep down the anger of a minute,you will for a whole life-time feel no remorse."
Whether Chin Jung complied or not to his advice is not known, but thefollowing chapter will explain.

CHAPTER X.
  Widow Chin, prompted by a desire to reap advantage, puts up      temporarily with an insult.  Dr. Chang in discussing Mrs. Chin's illness minutely exhausts its      origin.
We will now resume our story. As the persons against Chin Jung were somany and their pressure so great, and as, what was more, Chia Jui urgedhim to make amends, he had to knock his head on the ground before Ch'inChung. Pao-y� then gave up his clamorous remonstrances and the wholecrowd dispersed from school.
Chin Jung himself returned home all alone, but the more he pondered onthe occurrence, the more incensed he felt. "Ch'in Chung," he argued, "issimply Chia Jung's young brother-in-law, and is no son or grandson ofthe Chia family, and he too joins the class and prosecutes his studieson no other footing than that of mine; but it's because he relies uponPao-y�'s friendship for him that he has no eye for any one. This beingthe case, he should be somewhat proper in his behaviour, and there wouldbe then not a word to say about it! He has besides all along been verymystical with Pao-y�, imagining that we are all blind, and have no eyesto see what's up! Here he goes again to-day and mixes with people inillicit intrigues; and it's all because they happened to obtrudethemselves before my very eyes that this rumpus has broken out; but ofwhat need I fear?"
His mother, n�e Hu, hearing him mutter; "Why meddle again," sheexplained, "in things that don't concern you? I had endless trouble ingetting to speak to your paternal aunt; and your aunt had, on the otherhand, a thousand and one ways and means to devise, before she couldappeal to lady Secunda, of the Western mansion; and then only it wasthat you got this place to study in. Had we not others to depend uponfor your studies, would we have in our house the means sufficient toengage a teacher? Besides, in other people's school, tea and eatablesare all ready and found; and these two years that you've been there foryour lessons, we've likewise effected at home a great saving in whatwould otherwise have been necessary for your eating and use. Somethinghas been, it's true, economised; but you have further a liking for spickand span clothes. Besides, it's only through your being there to study,that you've come to know Mr. Hs�eh! that Mr. Hs�eh, who has even in oneyear given us so much pecuniary assistance as seventy and eighty taels!And now you would go and raise a row in this school-room! why, if wewere bent upon finding such another place, I tell you plainly, and oncefor all, that we would find it more difficult than if we tried to scalethe heavens! Now do quietly play for a while, and then go to sleep, andyou'll be ever so much better for it then."
Chin Jung thereupon stifled his anger and held his tongue; and, after ashort while, he in fact went to sleep of his own accord.
The next day he again went to school, and no further comment need bemade about it; but we will go on to explain that a young lady related toher had at one time been given in marriage to a descendant (of theeldest branch) of the Chia family, (whose names were written) with thejade radical, Chia Huang by name; but how could the whole number ofmembers of the clan equal in affluence and power the two mansions ofNing and Jung? This fact goes, as a matter of course, without saying.The Chia Huang couple enjoyed some small income; but they also went, onfrequent occasions, to the mansions of Ning and Jung to pay theirrespects; and they knew likewise so well how to adulate lady Feng andMrs. Yu, that lady Feng and Mrs. Yu would often grant them thatassistance and support which afforded them the means of meeting theirdaily expenses.
It just occurred on this occasion that the weather was clear and fine,and that there happened, on the other hand, to be nothing to attend toat home, so forthwith taking along with her a matron, (Mrs. Chia Huang)got into a carriage and came over to see widow Chin and her nephew.While engaged in a chat, Chin Jung's mother accidentally broached thesubject of the affair, which had transpired in the school-room of theChia mansion on the previous day, and she gave, for the benefit of heryoung sister-in-law, a detailed account of the whole occurrence frombeginning to end.
This Mrs. Huang would not have had her temper ruffled had she not cometo hear what had happened; but having heard about it, anger sprung fromthe very depths of her heart. "This fellow, Ch'in Chung," she exclaimed,"is a relative of the Chia family, but is it likely that Jung Erh isn't,in like manner, a relative of the Chia family; and when relatives aremany, there's no need to put on airs! Besides, does his conduct consist,for the most part, of anything that would make one get any face? Infact, Pao-y� himself shouldn't do injury to himself by condescending tolook at him. But, as things have come to this pass, give me time andI'll go to the Eastern mansion and see our lady Chen and then have achat with Ch'in Chung's sister, and ask her to decide who's right andwho's wrong!"
Chin Jung's mother upon hearing these words was terribly distressed."It's all through my hasty tongue," she observed with vehemence, "thatI've told you all, sister-in-law: but please, sister, give up at oncethe idea of going over to say anything about it! Don't trouble yourselfas to who is in the right, and who is in the wrong; for were anyunpleasantness to come out of it, how could we here stand on our legs?and were we not to stand on our legs, not only would we never be able toengage a tutor, but the result will be, on the contrary, that for hisown person will be superadded many an expense for eatables andnecessaries."
"What do I care about how many?" replied Mrs. Huang; "wait till I'vespoken about it, and we'll see what will be the result." Nor would sheaccede to her sister-in-law's entreaties, but bidding, at the same time,the matron look after the carriage, she got into it, and came over tothe Ning Mansion.
On her arrival at the Ning Mansion, she entered by the eastern sidegate, and dismounting from the carriage, she went in to call on Mrs. Yu,the spouse of Chia Chen, with whom she had not the courage to put on anyhigh airs; but gently and quietly she made inquiries after her health,and after passing some irrelevant remarks, she ascertained: "How is it Idon't see lady Jung to-day?"
"I don't know," replied Mrs. Yu, "what's the matter with her these lastfew days; but she hasn't been herself for two months and more; and thedoctor who was asked to see her declares that it is nothing connectedwith any happy event. A couple of days back, she felt, as soon as theafternoon came, both to move, and both even to utter a word; while thebrightness of her eyes was all dimmed; and I told her, 'You needn'tstick to etiquette, for there's no use for you to come in the forenoonand evening, as required by conventionalities; but what you must do is,to look after your own health. Should any relative come over, there'salso myself to receive them; and should any of the senior generationthink your absence strange, I'll explain things for you, if you'll letme.'
"I also advised brother Jung on the subject: 'You shouldn't,' I said,'allow any one to trouble her; nor let her be put out of temper, but lether quietly attend to her health, and she'll get all right. Should shefancy anything to eat, just come over here and fetch it; for, in theevent of anything happening to her, were you to try and find anothersuch a wife to wed, with such a face and such a disposition, why, Ifear, were you even to seek with a lantern in hand, there would reallybe no place where you could discover her. And with such a temperamentand deportment as hers, which of our relatives and which of our eldersdon't love her?' That's why my heart has been very distressed these twodays! As luck would have it early this morning her brother turned up tosee her, but who would have fancied him to be such a child, and soignorant of what is proper and not proper to do? He saw well enough thathis sister was not well; and what's more all these matters shouldn'thave been recounted to her; for even supposing he had received thegravest offences imaginable, it behoved him anyhow not to have broachedthe subject to her! Yesterday, one would scarcely believe it, a fightoccurred in the school-room, and some pupil or other who attends thatclass, somehow insulted him; besides, in this business, there were agood many indecent and improper utterances, but all these he went andtold his sister! Now, sister-in-law, you are well aware that though (ourson Jung's) wife talks and laughs when she sees people, that she isnevertheless imaginative and withal too sensitive, so that no matterwhat she hears, she's for the most part bound to brood over it for threedays and five nights, before she loses sight of it, and it's from thisexcessive sensitiveness that this complaint of hers arises. Today, whenshe heard that some one had insulted her brother, she felt both vexedand angry; vexed that those fox-like, cur-like friends of his had movedright and wrong, and intrigued with this one and deluded that one; angrythat her brother had, by not learning anything profitable, and nothaving his mind set upon study, been the means of bringing about a rowat school; and on account of this affair, she was so upset that she didnot even have her early meal. I went over a short while back andconsoled her for a time, and likewise gave her brother a few words ofadvice; and after having packed off that brother of hers to the mansionon the other side, in search of Pao-y�, and having stood by and seen herhave half a bowl of birds' nests soup, I at length came over. Now,sister-in-law, tell me, is my heart sore or not? Besides, as there'snowadays no good doctor, the mere thought of her complaint makes myheart feel as if it were actually pricked with needles! But do you andyours, perchance, know of any good practitioner?"
Mrs. Chin had, while listening to these words, been, at an early period,so filled with concern that she cast away to distant lands the recklessrage she had been in recently while at her sister-in-law's house, whenshe had determined to go and discuss matters over with Mrs. Ch'in. Uponhearing Mrs. Yu inquire of her about a good doctor, she lost no time insaying by way of reply: "Neither have we heard of any one speak of agood doctor; but from the account I've just heard of Mrs. Ch'in'sillness, it may still, there's no saying, be some felicitous ailment;so, sister-in-law, don't let any one treat her recklessly, for were sheto be treated for the wrong thing, the result may be dreadful!"
"Quite so!" replied Mrs. Yu.
But while they were talking, Chia Chen came in from out of doors, andupon catching sight of Mrs. Chin; "Isn't this Mrs. Huang?" he inquiredof Mrs. Yu; whereupon Mrs. Chin came forward and paid her respects toChia Chen.
"Invite this lady to have her repast here before she goes," observedChia Chen to Mrs. Yu; and as he uttered these words he forthwith walkedinto the room on the off side.
The object of Mrs. Chin's present visit had originally been to talk toMrs. Ch'in about the insult which her brother had received from thehands of Ch'in Chung, but when she heard that Mrs. Ch'in was ill, shedid not have the courage to even so much as make mention of the objectof her errand. Besides, as Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu had given her a mostcordial reception, her resentment was transformed into pleasure, so thatafter a while spent in a further chat about one thing and another, sheat length returned to her home.
It was only after the departure of Mrs. Chin that Chia Chen came overand took a seat. "What did she have to say for herself during this visitto-day?" he asked of Mrs. Yu.
"She said nothing much," replied Mrs. Yu. "When she first entered theroom, her face bore somewhat of an angry look, but, after a lengthy chatand as soon as mention of our son's wife's illness was made, thisangered look after all gradually abated. You also asked me to keep herfor the repast, but, having heard that our son's wife was so ill shecould not very well stay, so that all she did was to sit down, and aftermaking a few more irrelevant remarks, she took her departure. But shehad no request to make. To return however now to the illness of Jung'swife, it's urgent that you should find somewhere a good doctor todiagnose it for her; and whatever you do, you should lose no time. Thewhole body of doctors who at present go in and out of our household, arethey worth having? Each one of them listens to what the patient has tosay of the ailment, and then, adding a string of flowery sentences, outhe comes with a long rigmarole; but they are exceedingly diligent inpaying us visits; and in one day, three or four of them are here atleast four and five times in rotation! They come and feel her pulse,they hold consultation together, and write their prescriptions, but,though she has taken their medicines, she has seen no improvement; onthe contrary, she's compelled to change her clothes three and five timeseach day, and to sit up to see the doctor; a thing which, in fact, doesthe patient no good."
"This child too is somewhat simple," observed Chia Chen; "for what needhas she to be taking off her clothes, and changing them for others? Andwere she again to catch a chill, she would add something more to herillness; and won't it be dreadful! The clothes may be no matter howfine, but what is their worth, after all? The health of our child iswhat is important to look to! and were she even to wear out a suit ofnew clothes a-day, what would that too amount to? I was about to tellyou that a short while back, Feng Tzu-ying came to see me, and,perceiving that I had somewhat of a worried look, he asked me what wasup; and I told him that our son's wife was not well at all, that as wecouldn't get any good doctor, we couldn't determine with any certainty,whether she was in an interesting condition, or whether she wassuffering from some disease; that as we could neither tell whether therewas any danger or not, my heart was, for this reason, really very muchdistressed. Feng Tzu-ying then explained that he knew a young doctor whohad made a study of his profession, Chang by surname, and Yu-shih byname, whose learning was profound to a degree; who was besides mostproficient in the principles of medicine, and had the knack ofdiscriminating whether a patient would live or die; that this year hehad come to the capital to purchase an official rank for his son, andthat he was now living with him in his house. In view of thesecircumstances, not knowing but that if, perchance, the case of ourdaughter-in-law were placed in his hands, he couldn't avert the danger,I readily despatched a servant, with a card of mine, to invite him tocome; but the hour to-day being rather late, he probably won't be round,but I believe he's sure to be here to-morrow. Besides, Feng-Tzu-ying wasalso on his return home, to personally entreat him on my behalf, so thathe's bound, when he has asked him, to come and see her. Let's thereforewait till Dr. Chang has been here and seen her, when we can talk mattersover!"
Mrs. Yu was very much cheered when she heard what was said. "The dayafter to-morrow," she felt obliged to add, "is again our senior's, Mr.Chia Ching's birthday, and how are we to celebrate it after all?"
"I've just been over to our Senior's and paid my respects," replied ChiaChen, "and further invited the old gentleman to come home, and receivethe congratulations of the whole family.
"'I'm accustomed,' our Senior explained, 'to peace and quiet, and haveno wish to go over to that worldly place of yours; for you people arecertain to have published that it's my birthday, and to entertain thedesign to ask me to go round to receive the bows of the whole lot ofyou. But won't it be better if you were to give the "Record ofMeritorious Acts," which I annotated some time ago, to some one to copyout clean for me, and have it printed? Compared with asking me to come,and uselessly receive the obeisances of you all, this will be yea even ahundred times more profitable! In the event of the whole family wishingto pay me a visit on any of the two days, to-morrow or the day afterto-morrow, if you were to stay at home and entertain them in properstyle, that will be all that is wanted; nor will there be any need tosend me anything! Even you needn't come two days from this; and shouldyou not feel contented at heart, well, you had better bow your headbefore me to-day before you go. But if you do come again the day afterto-morrow, with a lot of people to disturb me, I shall certainly beangry with you.' After what he said, I will not venture to go and seehim two days hence; but you had better send for Lai Sheng, and bid himget ready a banquet to continue for a couple of days."
Mrs. Yu, having asked Chia Jung to come round, told him to direct LaiSheng to make the usual necessary preparations for a banquet to last fora couple of days, with due regard to a profuse and sumptuous style.
"You go by-and-by," (she advised him), "in person to the Western Mansionand invite dowager lady Chia, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and yoursister-in-law Secunda lady Lien to come over for a stroll. Your fatherhas also heard of a good doctor, and having already sent some one to askhim round, I think that by to-morrow he's sure to come; and you hadbetter tell him, in a minute manner, the serious symptoms of her ailmentduring these few days."
Chia Jung having signified his obedience to each of her recommendations,and taken his leave, was just in time to meet the youth coming back fromFeng Tzu-ying's house, whither he had gone a short while back to invitethe doctor round.
"Your slave," he consequently reported, "has just been with a card ofmaster's to Mr. Feng's house and asked the doctor to come. 'The gentlemanhere,' replied the doctor, 'has just told me about it; but to-day, I'vehad to call on people the whole day, and I've only this moment comehome; and I feel now my strength (so worn out), that I couldn't reallystand any exertion. In fact were I even to get as far as the mansion, Ishouldn't be in a fit state to diagnose the pulses! I must thereforehave a night's rest, but, to-morrow for certain, I shall come to themansion. My medical knowledge,' he went on to observe, 'is very shallow,and I don't deserve the honour of such eminent recommendation; but asMr. Feng has already thus spoken of me in your mansion, I can't butpresent myself. It will be all right if in anticipation you deliver thismessage for me to your honourable master; but as for your worthymaster's card, I cannot really presume to keep it.' It was again at hisinstance that I've brought it back; but, Sir, please mention this resultfor me (to master)."
Chia Jung turned back again, and entering the house delivered themessage to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; whereupon he walked out, and, callingLai Sheng before him, he transmitted to him the orders to prepare thebanquet for a couple of days.
After Lai Sheng had listened to the directions, he went off, of course,to get ready the customary preparations; but upon these we shall notdilate, but confine ourselves to the next day.
At noon, a servant on duty at the gate announced that the Doctor Chang,who had been sent for, had come, and Chia Chen conducted him along theCourt into the large reception Hall, where they sat down; and after theyhad partaken of tea, he broached the subject.
"Yesterday," he explained, "the estimable Mr. Feng did me the honour tospeak to me of your character and proficiency, venerable doctor, as wellas of your thorough knowledge of medicine, and I, your mean brother, wasfilled with an immeasurable sense of admiration!"
"Your Junior," remonstrated Dr. Chang, "is a coarse, despicable and meanscholar and my knowledge is shallow and vile! but as worthy Mr. Feng didme the honour yesterday of telling me that your family, sir, hadcondescended to look upon me, a low scholar, and to favour me too withan invitation, could I presume not to obey your commands? But as Icannot boast of the least particle of real learning, I feel overburdenedwith shame!"
"Why need you be so modest?" observed Chia Chen; "Doctor, do please walkin at once to see our son's wife, for I look up, with full reliance, toyour lofty intelligence to dispel my solicitude!"
Chia Jung forthwith walked in with him. When they reached the innerapartment, and he caught sight of Mrs. Ch'in, he turned round and askedChia Jung, "This is your honourable spouse, isn't it?"
"Yes, it is," assented Chia Jung; "but please, Doctor, take a seat, andlet me tell you the symptoms of my humble wife's ailment, before herpulse be felt. Will this do?"
"My mean idea is," remarked the Doctor, "that it would, after all, bebetter that I should begin by feeling her pulse, before I ask you toinform me what the source of the ailment is. This is the first visit Ipay to your honourable mansion; besides, I possess no knowledge ofanything; but as our worthy Mr. Feng would insist upon my coming over tosee you, I had in consequence no alternative but to come. After I havenow made a diagnosis, you can judge whether what I say is right or not,before you explain to me the phases of the complaint during the last fewdays, and we can deliberate together upon some prescription; as to thesuitableness or unsuitableness of which your honourable father will thenhave to decide, and what is necessary will have been done."
"Doctor," rejoined Chia Jung, "you are indeed eminently clear sighted;all I regret at present is that we have met so late! But please, Doctor,diagnose the state of the pulse, so as to find out whether there be hopeof a cure or not; if a cure can be effected, it will be the means ofallaying the solicitude of my father and mother."
The married women attached to that menage forthwith presented a pillow;and as it was being put down for Mrs. Ch'in to rest her arm on, theyraised the lower part of her sleeve so as to leave her wrist exposed.The Doctor thereupon put out his hand and pressed it on the pulse of theright hand. Regulating his breath (to the pulsation) so as to be able tocount the beatings, he with due care and minuteness felt the action fora considerable time, when, substituting the left hand, he again wentthrough the same operation.
"Let us go and sit outside," he suggested, after he had concludedfeeling her pulses. Chia Jung readily adjourned, in company with theDoctor, to the outer apartment, where they seated themselves on thestove-couch. A matron having served tea; "Please take a cup of tea,doctor," Chia Jung observed. When tea was over, "Judging," he inquired,"Doctor, from the present action of the pulses, is there any remedy ornot?"
"The action of the pulse, under the forefinger, on the left hand of yourhonorable spouse," proceeded the Doctor, "is deep and agitated; the lefthand pulse, under the second finger, is deep and faint. The pulse, underthe forefinger, of the right hand, is gentle and lacks vitality. Theright hand pulse, under my second finger, is superficial, and has lostall energy. The deep and agitated beating of the forepulse of the lefthand arises from the febrile state, due to the weak action of the heart.The deep and delicate condition of the second part of the pulse of theleft wrist, emanates from the sluggishness of the liver, and thescarcity of the blood in that organ. The action of the forefinger pulse,of the right wrist, is faint and lacks strength, as the breathing of thelungs is too weak. The second finger pulse of the right wrist issuperficial and devoid of vigour, as the spleen must be affectedinjuriously by the liver. The weak action of the heart, and its febrilestate, should be the natural causes which conduce to the presentirregularity in the catamenia, and insomnia at night; the poverty ofblood in the liver, and the sluggish condition of that organ mustnecessarily produce pain in the ribs; while the overdue of thecatamenia, the cardiac fever, and debility of the respiration of thelungs, should occasion frequent giddiness in the head, and swimming ofthe eyes, the certain recurrence of perspiration between the periods of3 to 5 and 5 to 7, and the sensation of being seated on board ship. Theobstruction of the spleen by the liver should naturally create distastefor liquid or food, debility of the vital energies and prostration ofthe four limbs. From my diagnosis of these pulses, there should existthese various symptoms, before (the pulses and the symptoms can be said)to harmonise. But should perchance (any doctor maintain) that this stateof the pulses imports a felicitous event, your servant will not presumeto give an ear to such an opinion!"
A matron, who was attached as a personal attendant (to Mrs. Ch'in,) andwho happened to be standing by interposed: "How could it be otherwise?"she ventured. "In real truth, Doctor, you speak like a supernaturalbeing, and there's verily no need for us to say anything! We have now,ready at hand, in our household, a good number of medical gentlemen, whoare in attendance upon her, but none of these are proficient enough tospeak in this positive manner. Some there are who say that it's agenital complaint; others maintain that it's an organic disease. Thisdoctor explains that there is no danger: while another, again, holdsthat there's fear of a crisis either before or after the wintersolstice; but there is, in one word, nothing certain said by them. Mayit please you, sir, now to favour us with your clear directions."
"This complaint of your lady's," observed the Doctor, "has certainlybeen neglected by the whole number of doctors; for had a treatment withcertain medicines been initiated at the time of the first occurrence ofher habitual sickness, I cannot but opine that, by this time, a perfectcure would have been effected. But seeing that the organic complaint hasnow been, through neglect, allowed to reach this phase, this calamitywas, in truth, inevitable. My ideas are that this illness stands, asyet, a certain chance of recovery, (three chances out of ten); but wewill see how she gets on, after she has had these medicines of mine.Should they prove productive of sleep at night, then there will be addedfurthermore two more chances in the grip of our hands. From mydiagnosis, your lady is a person, gifted with a pre�minently excellent,and intelligent disposition; but an excessive degree of intelligence isthe cause of frequent contrarieties; and frequent contrarieties giveorigin to an excessive amount of anxious cares. This illness arises fromthe injury done, by worrying and fretting, to the spleen, and from theinordinate vigour of the liver; hence it is that the relief cannot comeat the proper time and season. Has not your lady, may I ask, heretoforeat the period of the catamenia, suffered, if indeed not from anaemia,then necessarily from plethora? Am I right in assuming this or not?"
"To be sure she did," replied the matron; "but she has never beensubject to anaemia, but to a plethora, varying from either two to threedays, and extending, with much irregularity, to even ten days."
"Quite so!" observed the Doctor, after hearing what she had to say, "andthis is the source of this organic illness! Had it in past days beentreated with such medicine as could strengthen the heart, and improvethe respiration, would it have reached this stage? This has now overtlymade itself manifest in an ailment originating from the paucity of waterand the vigour of fire; but let me make use of some medicines, and we'llsee how she gets on!"
There and then he set to work and wrote a prescription, which he handedto Chia Jung, the purpose of which was: Decoction for the improvement ofrespiration, the betterment of the blood, and the restoration of thespleen. Ginseng, Atractylodes Lancea; Yunnan root; Prepared Ti root;Aralia edulis; Peony roots; Levisticum from Sze Ch'uan; Sophoratormentosa; Cyperus rotundus, prepared with rice; Gentian, soaked invinegar; Huai Shan Yao root; Real "O" glue; Carydalis Ambigua; and Driedliquorice. Seven Fukien lotus seeds, (the cores of which should beextracted,) and two large zizyphi to be used as a preparative.
"What exalted intelligence!" Chia Jung, after perusing it, exclaimed."But I would also ask you, Doctor, to be good enough to tell me whetherthis illness will, in the long run, endanger her life or not?"
The Doctor smiled. "You, sir, who are endowed with most eminentintelligence (are certain to know) that when a human illness has reachedthis phase, it is not a derangement of a day or of a single night; butafter these medicines have been taken, we shall also have to watch theeffect of the treatment! My humble opinion is that, as far as the winterof this year goes, there is no fear; in fact, after the spring equinox,I entertain hopes of a complete cure."
Chia Jung was likewise a person with all his wits about him, so that hedid not press any further minute questions.
Chia Jung forthwith escorted the Doctor and saw him off, and taking theprescription and the diagnosis, he handed them both to Chia Chen for hisperusal, and in like manner recounted to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu all thathad been said on the subject.
"The other doctors have hitherto not expressed any opinions as positiveas this one has done," observed Mrs. Yu, addressing herself to ChiaChen, "so that the medicines to be used are, I think, surely the rightones!"
"He really isn't a man," rejoined Chia Chen, "accustomed to give much ofhis time to the practice of medicine, in order to earn rice for hissupport: and it's Feng Tzu-ying, who is so friendly with us, who ismainly to be thanked for succeeding, after ever so much trouble, ininducing him to come. But now that we have this man, the illness of ourson's wife may, there is no saying, stand a chance of being cured. Buton that prescription of his there is ginseng mentioned, so you hadbetter make use of that catty of good quality which was bought the otherday."
Chia Jung listened until the conversation came to a close, after whichhe left the room, and bade a servant go and buy the medicines, in orderthat they should be prepared and administered to Mrs. Ch'in.
What was the state of Mrs. Ch'in's illness, after she partook of thesemedicines, we do not know; but, reader, listen to the explanation givenin the chapter which follows.

CHAPTER XI.
  In honour of Chia Ching's birthday, a family banquet is spread in the      Ning Mansion.  At the sight of Hsi-feng, Chia Jui entertains feelings of licentious      love.
We will now explain, in continuation of our story, that on the day ofChia Ching's birthday, Chia Chen began by getting ready lusciousdelicacies and rare fruits, which he packed in sixteen spacious presentboxes, and bade Chia Jung take them, along with the servants belongingto the household, over to Chia Ching.
Turning round towards Chia Jung: "Mind," he said, "that you observewhether your grandfather be agreeable or not, before you set to work andpay your obeisance! 'My father,' tell him, 'has complied with yourdirections, venerable senior, and not presumed to come over; but he hasat home ushered the whole company of the members of the family (intoyour apartments), where they all paid their homage facing the side ofhonour.'"
After Chia Jung had listened to these injunctions, he speedily led offthe family domestics, and took his departure. During this interval, oneby one arrived the guests. First came Chia Lien and Chia Se, who went tosee whether the seats in the various places (were sufficient). "Is thereto be any entertainment or not?" they also inquired.
"Our master," replied the servants, "had, at one time, intended toinvite the venerable Mr. Chia Ching to come and spend this day at home,and hadn't for this reason presumed to get up any entertainment. Butwhen the other day he came to hear that the old gentleman was notcoming, he at once gave us orders to go in search of a troupe of youngactors, as well as a band of musicians, and all these people are nowengaged making their preparations on the stage in the garden."
Next came, in a group, mesdames Hsing and Wang, lady Feng and Pao-y�,followed immediately after by Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; Mrs. Yu's motherhaving already arrived and being in there in advance of her. Salutationswere exchanged between the whole company, and they pressed one anotherto take a seat. Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu both handed the tea round.
"Our venerable lady," they explained, as they smiled, "is a worthysenior; while our father is, on the other hand, only her nephew; so thaton a birthday of a man of his age, we should really not have had theaudacity to invite her ladyship; but as the weather, at this time, iscool, and the chrysanthemums, in the whole garden, are in luxuriantblossom, we have requested our venerable ancestor to come for a littledistraction, and to see the whole number of her children andgrand-children amuse themselves. This was the object we had in view,but, contrary to our expectations, our worthy senior has not againconferred upon us the lustre of her countenance."
Lady Feng did not wait until madame Wang could open her mouth, but tookthe initiative to reply. "Our venerable lady," she urged, "had, even solate as yesterday, said that she meant to come; but, in the evening,upon seeing brother Pao eating peaches, the mouth of the old lady onceagain began to water, and after partaking of a little more than the halfof one, she had, about the fifth watch, to get out of bed twoconsecutive times, with the result that all the forenoon to-day, shefelt her body considerably worn out. She therefore bade me inform ourworthy senior that it was utterly impossible for her to come to-day;adding however that, if there were any delicacies, she fancied a fewkinds, but that they should be very tender."
When Chia Chen heard these words, he smiled. "Our dowager lady," hereplied, "is, I argued, so fond of amusement that, if she doesn't cometo-day, there must, for a certainty, be some valid reason; and that'sexactly what happens to be the case."
"The other day I heard your eldest sister explain," interposed madameWang, "that Chia Jung's wife was anything but well; but what's after allthe matter with her?"
"She has," observed Mrs. Yu, "contracted this illness verily in astrange manner! Last moon at the time of the mid-autumn festival, shewas still well enough to be able to enjoy herself, during half thenight, in company with our dowager lady and madame Wang. On her return,she continued in good health, until after the twentieth, when she beganto feel more and more languid every day, and loth, likewise, to eatanything; and this has been going on for well-nigh half a month andmore; she hasn't besides been anything like her old self for twomonths."
"May she not," remarked madame Hsing, taking up the thread of theconversation, "be ailing for some happy event?"
But while she was uttering these words, some one from outside announced:"Our senior master, second master and all the gentlemen of the familyhave come, and are standing in the Reception Hall!" Whereupon Chia Chenand Chia Lien quitted the apartment with hurried step; and during thiswhile, Mrs. Yu reiterated how that some time ago a doctor had alsoexpressed the opinion that she was ailing for a happy event, but thatthe previous day, had come a doctor, recommended by Feng Tzu-ying--adoctor, who had from his youth up made medicine his study, and was veryproficient in the treatment of diseases,--who asserted, after he hadseen her, that it was no felicitous ailment, but that it was some gravecomplaint. "It was only yesterday," (she explained,) "that he wrote hisprescription; and all she has had is but one dose, and already to-daythe giddiness in the head is considerably better; as regards the othersymptoms they have as yet shown no marked improvement."
"I maintain," remarked lady Feng, "that, were she not quite unfit tostand the exertion, would she in fact, on a day like this, be unwillingto strain every nerve and come round."
"You saw her," observed Mrs. Yu, "on the third in here; how that shebore up with a violent effort for ever so long, but it was all becauseof the friendship that exists between you two, that she still longed foryour society, and couldn't brook the idea of tearing herself away."
When lady Feng heard these words, her eyes got quite red, and after atime she at length exclaimed: "In the Heavens of a sudden come wind andrain; while with man, in a day and in a night, woe and weal survene! Butwith her tender years, if for a complaint like this she were to run anyrisk, what pleasure is there for any human being to be born and tosojourn in the world?"
She was just speaking, when Chia Jung walked into the apartment; andafter paying his respects to madame Hsing, madame Wang, and lady Feng,he then observed to Mrs. Yu: "I have just taken over the eatables to ourvenerable ancestor; and, at the same time, I told him that my father wasat home waiting upon the senior, and entertaining the junior gentlemenof the whole family, and that in compliance with grandfather's orders,he did not presume to go over. The old gentleman was much delighted bywhat he heard me say, and having signified that that was all in order,bade me tell father and you, mother, to do all you can in yourattendance upon the senior gentlemen and ladies, enjoining me toentertain, with all propriety, my uncles, aunts, and my cousins. He alsowent on to urge me to press the men to cut, with all despatch, theblocks for the Record of Meritorious Deeds, and to print ten thousandcopies for distribution. All these messages I have duly delivered to myfather, but I must now be quick and go out, so as to send the eatablesfor the elder as well as for the younger gentlemen of the entirehousehold."
"Brother Jung Erh," exclaimed lady Feng, "wait a moment. How is yourwife getting on? how is she, after all, to-day?"
"Not well," replied Chia Jung. "But were you, aunt, on your return to goin and see her, you will find out for yourself."
Chia Jung forthwith left the room. During this interval, Mrs. Yuaddressed herself to mesdames Hsing and Wang; "My ladies," she asked,"will you have your repast in here, or will you go into the garden forit? There are now in the garden some young actors engaged in makingtheir preparations?"
"It's better in here," madame Wang remarked, as she turned towardsmadame Hsing.
Mrs. Yu thereupon issued directions to the married women and matrons tobe quick in serving the eatables. The servants, in waiting outside thedoor, with one voice signified their obedience; and each of them wentoff to fetch what fell to her share. In a short while, the courses wereall laid out, and Mrs. Yu pressed mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well asher mother, into the upper seats; while she, together with lady Feng andPao-y�, sat at a side table.
"We've come," observed mesdames Hsing and Wang, "with the original ideaof paying our congratulations to our venerable senior on the occasion ofhis birthday; and isn't this as if we had come for our own birthdays?"
"The old gentleman," answered lady Feng, "is a man fond of a quiet life;and as he has already consummated a process of purification, he may wellbe looked upon as a supernatural being, so that the purpose to whichyour ladyships have given expression may be considered as manifest tohis spirit, upon the very advent of the intention."
As this sentence was uttered the whole company in the room burst outlaughing. Mrs. Yu's mother, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Fenghaving one and all partaken of the banquet, rinsed their mouths andwashed their hands, which over, they expressed a wish to go into thegarden.
Chia Jung entered the room. "The senior gentlemen," he said to Mrs. Yu,"as well as all my uncles and cousins, have finished their repast; butthe elder gentleman Mr. Chia She, who excused himself on the score ofhaving at home something to attend to, and Mr. Secundus (Chia Cheng),who is not partial to theatrical performances and is always afraid thatpeople will be too boisterous in their entertainments, have both of themtaken their departure. The rest of the family gentlemen have been takenover by uncle Secundus Mr. Lien, and Mr. Se, to the other side to listento the play. A few moments back Prince Nan An, Prince Tung P'ing, PrinceHsi Ning, Prince Pei Ching, these four Princes, with Niu, Duke of ChenKuo, and five other dukes, six in all, and Shih, Marquis of Chung Ching,and other seven, in all eight marquises, sent their messengers withtheir cards and presents. I have already told father all about it; butbefore I did so, the presents were put away in the counting room, thelists of presents were all entered in the book, and the 'received withthanks' cards were handed to the respective messengers of the variousmansions; the men themselves were also tipped in the customary manner,and all of them were kept to have something to eat before they went ontheir way. But, mother, you should invite the two ladies, your motherand my aunt, to go over and sit in the garden."
"Just so!" observed Mrs. Yu, "but we've only now finished our repast,and were about to go over."
"I wish to tell you, madame," interposed lady Feng, "that I shall gofirst and see brother Jung's wife and then come and join you."
"All right," replied madame Wang; "we should all have been fain to havepaid her a visit, did we not fear lest she should look upon ourdisturbing her with displeasure, but just tell her that we would like toknow how she is getting on!"
"My dear sister," remarked Mrs. Yu, "as our son's wife has a ready earfor all you say, do go and cheer her up, (and if you do so,) it willbesides set my own mind at ease; but be quick and come as soon as youcan into the garden."
Pao-y� being likewise desirous to go along with lady Feng to see ladyCh'in, madame Wang remarked, "Go and see her just for a while, and thencome over at once into the garden; (for remember) she is your nephew'swife, (and you couldn't sit in there long)."
Mrs. Yu forthwith invited mesdames Wang and Hsing, as well as her ownmother, to adjourn to the other side, and they all in a body walked intothe garden of Concentrated Fragrance; while lady Feng and Pao-y� betookthemselves, in company with Chia Jung, over to this side.
Having entered the door, they with quiet step walked as far as theentrance of the inner chamber. Mrs. Ch'in, upon catching sight of them,was bent upon getting up; but "Be quick," remonstrated lady Feng, "andgive up all idea of standing up; for take care your head will feeldizzy."
Lady Feng hastened to make a few hurried steps forward and to grasp Mrs.Ch'in's hand in hers. "My dear girl!" she exclaimed; "How is it thatduring the few days I've not seen you, you have grown so thin?"
Readily she then took a seat on the rug, on which Mrs. Ch'in was seated,while Pao-y�, after inquiring too about her health, sat in the chair onthe opposite side.
"Bring the tea in at once," called out Chia Jung, "for aunt and uncleSecundus have not had any tea in the drawing room."
Mrs. Ch'in took lady Feng's hand in her own and forced a smile. "This isall due to my lack of good fortune; for in such a family as this, myfather and mother-in-law treat me just as if I were a daughter of theirown flesh and blood! Besides, your nephew, (my husband,) may, it istrue, my dear aunt, be young in years, but he is full of regard for me,as I have regard for him, and we have had so far no misunderstandingbetween us! In fact, among the senior generation, as well as that of thesame age as myself, in the whole clan, putting you aside, aunt, aboutwhom no mention need be made, there is not one who has not ever hadanything but love for me, and not one who has not ever shown me anythingbut kindness! But since I've fallen ill with this complaint, all myenergy has even every bit of it been taken out of me, so that I've beenunable to show to my father and mother-in-law any mark of filialattention, yea so much as for one single day and to you, my dear aunt,with all this affection of yours for me, I have every wish to be dutifulto the utmost degree, but, in my present state, I'm really not equal toit; my own idea is, that it isn't likely that I shall last through thisyear."
Pao-y� kept, while (she spoke,) his eyes fixed intently upon a pictureon the opposite side, representing some begonias drooping in the springtime, and upon a pair of scrolls, with this inscription written by Ch'inTai-hs�:
  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man because the spring      is cold!  The fragrant whiff which wafts itself into man's nose, is the perfume      of wine!
And he could not help recalling to mind his experiences at the time whenhe had fallen asleep in this apartment, and had, in his dream, visitedthe confines of the Great Void. He was just plunged in a state ofabstraction, when he heard Mrs. Ch'in give utterance to thesesentiments, which pierced his heart as if they were ten thousand arrows,(with the result that) tears unwittingly trickled from his eyes.
Lady Feng perceiving him in tears felt it extremely painful withinherself to bear the sight; but she was on pins and needles lest thepatient should detect their frame of mind, and feel, instead (ofbenefit), still more sore at heart, which would not, after all, be quitethe purpose of her visit; which was to afford her distraction andconsolation. "Pao-y�," she therefore exclaimed, "you are like an oldwoman! Ill, as she is, simply makes her speak in this wise, and how evercould things come to such a pass! Besides, she is young in years, sothat after a short indisposition, her illness will get all right!""Don't," she said as she turned towards Mrs. Ch'in, "give way to sillythoughts and idle ideas! for by so doing won't you yourself beaggravating your ailment?"
"All that her sickness in fact needs," observed Chia Jung, "is, that sheshould be able to take something to eat, and then there will be nothingto fear."
"Brother Pao," urged lady Feng, "your mother told you to go over, assoon as you could, so that don't stay here, and go on in the way you'redoing, for you after all incite this lady also to feel uneasy at heart.Besides, your mother over there is solicitous on your account." "You hadbetter go ahead with your uncle Pao," she consequently continued,addressing herself to Chia Jung, "while I sit here a little longer."
When Chia Jung heard this remark, he promptly crossed over with Pao-y�into the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, while lady Feng went on bothto cheer her up for a time, and to impart to her, in an undertone, agood deal of confidential advice.
Mrs. Yu had despatched servants, on two or three occasions, to hurrylady Feng, before she said to Mrs. Ch'in: "Do all you can to take goodcare of yourself, and I'll come and see you again. You're bound to getover this illness; and now, in fact, that you've come across thatrenowned doctor, you have really nothing more to fear."
"He might," observed Mrs. Ch'in as she smiled, "even be a supernaturalbeing and succeed in healing my disease, but he won't be able to remedymy destiny; for, my dear aunt, I feel sure that with this complaint ofmine, I can do no more than drag on from day to day."
"If you encourage such ideas," remonstrated lady Feng, "how can thisillness ever get all right? What you absolutely need is to cast away allthese notions, and then you'll improve. I hear moreover that the doctorasserts that if no cure be effected, the fear is of a change for theworse in spring, and not till then. Did you and I moreover belong to afamily that hadn't the means to afford any ginseng, it would bedifficult to say how we could manage to get it; but were your father andmother-in-law to hear that it's good for your recovery, why not to speakof two mace of ginseng a day, but even two catties will be also withintheir means! So mind you do take every care of your health! I'm now offon my way into the garden."
"Excuse me, my dear aunt," added Mrs. Ch'in, "that I can't go with you;but when you have nothing to do, I entreat you do come over and see me!and you and I can sit and have a long chat."
After lady Feng had heard these words, her eyes unwillingly got quitered again. "When I'm at leisure I shall, of course," she rejoined, "comeoften to see you;" and forthwith leading off the matrons and marriedwomen, who had come over with her, as well as the women and matrons ofthe Ning mansion, she passed through the inner part of the house, andentered, by a circuitous way, the side gate of the park, when sheperceived: yellow flowers covering the ground; white willows flankingthe slopes; diminutive bridges spanning streams, resembling the Jo Yeh;zigzag pathways (looking as if) they led to the steps of Heaven; limpidsprings dripping from among the rocks; flowers hanging from hedgesemitting their fragrance, as they were flapped by the winds; red leaveson the tree tops swaying to and fro; groves picture-like, half strippedof foliage; the western breeze coming with sudden gusts, and the wail ofthe oriole still audible; the warm sun shining with genial rays, and thecicada also adding its chirp: structures, visible to the gaze at adistance in the South-east, soaring high on various sites and restingagainst the hills; three halls, visible near by on the North-west,stretching in one connected line, on the bank of the stream; strains ofmusic filling the pavilion, imbued with an unwonted subtle charm; andmaidens in fine attire penetrating the groves, lending an additionalspell to the scene.
Lady Feng, while engaged in contemplating the beauties of the spot,advanced onwards step by step. She was plunged in a state of ecstasy,when suddenly, from the rear of the artificial rockery, egressed aperson, who approached her and facing her said, "My respects to you,sister-in-law."
Lady Feng was so startled by this unexpected appearance that she drewback. "Isn't this Mr. Jui?" she ventured.
"What! sister-in-law," exclaimed Chia Jui, "don't you recognise evenme?"
"It isn't that I didn't recognise you," explained lady Feng, "but at thesudden sight of you, I couldn't conceive that it would possibly be you,sir, in this place!"
"This was in fact bound to be," replied Chia Jui; "for there's somesubtle sympathy between me and you, sister-in-law. Here I juststealthily leave the entertainment, in order to revel for a while inthis solitary place when, against every expectation, I come across you,sister-in-law; and isn't this a subtle sympathy?"
As he spoke, he kept his gaze fixed on lady Feng, who being anintelligent person, could not but arrive, at the sight of his manner, atthe whole truth in her surmises. "It isn't to be wondered at," sheconsequently observed, as she smiled hypocritically, "that your eldestbrother should make frequent allusion to your qualities! for afterseeing you on this occasion, and hearing you utter these few remarks, Ihave readily discovered what an intelligent and genial person you are! Iam just now on my way to join the ladies on the other side, and have noleisure to converse with you; but wait until I've nothing to attend to,when we can meet again."
"I meant to have gone over to your place and paid my respects to you,sister-in-law," pleaded Chia Jui, "but I was afraid lest a person oftender years like yourself mightn't lightly receive any visitors!"
Lady Feng gave another sardonic smile. "Relatives," she continued, "ofone family, as we are, what need is there to say anything of tenderyears?"
After Chia Jui had heard these words, he felt his heart swell within himwith such secret joy that he was urged to reflect: "I have at lengthto-day, when least I expected it, obtained this remarkable encounterwith her!"
But as the display of his passion became still more repulsive, lady Fengurged him to go. "Be off at once," she remarked, "and join theentertainment; for mind, if they find you out, they will mulct you in somany glasses of wine!"
By the time this suggestion had reached Chia Jui's ears, half of hisbody had become stiff like a log of wood; and as he betook himself away,with lothful step, he turned his head round to cast glances at her. LadyFeng purposely slackened her pace; and when she perceived that he hadgone a certain distance, she gave way to reflection. "This is indeed,"she thought, "knowing a person, as far as face goes, and not as heart!Can there be another such a beast as he! If he really continues tobehave in this manner, I shall soon enough compass his death, with myown hands, and he'll then know what stuff I'm made of."
Lady Feng, at this juncture moved onward, and after turning round achain of hillocks, she caught sight of two or three matrons coming alongwith all speed. As soon as they espied lady Feng they put on a smile."Our mistress," they said, "perceiving that your ladyship was notforthcoming, has been in a great state of anxiety, and bade yourservants come again to request you to come over.
"Is your mistress," observed lady Feng, "so like a quick-footed demon?"
While lady Feng advanced leisurely, she inquired, "How many plays havebeen recited?" to which question one of the matrons replied, "They havegone through eight or nine." But while engaged in conversation, they hadalready reached the back door of the Tower of Celestial Fragrance, whereshe caught sight of Pao-y� playing with a company of waiting-maids andpages. "Brother Pao," lady Feng exclaimed, "don't be up to too muchmischief!" "The ladies are all sitting upstairs," interposed one of themaids. "Please, my lady, this is the way up."
At these words lady Feng slackened her pace, raised her dress, andwalked up the stairs, where Mrs. Yu was already at the top of thelanding waiting for her.
"You two," remarked Mrs. Yu, smiling, "are so friendly, that having metyou couldn't possibly tear yourself away to come. You had betterto-morrow move over there and take up your quarters with her and havedone; but sit down and let me, first of all, present you a glass ofwine."
Lady Feng speedily drew near mesdames Hsing and Wang, and beggedpermission to take a seat; while Mrs. Yu brought the programme, andpressed lady Feng to mark some plays.
"The senior ladies occupy the seats of honour," remonstrated lady Feng,"and how can I presume to choose?"
"We, and our relative by marriage, have selected several plays,"explained mesdames Hsing and Wang, "and it's for you now to choose somegood ones for us to listen to."
Standing up, lady Feng signified her obedience; and taking over theprogramme, and perusing it from top to bottom, she marked off oneentitled, the "Return of the Spirit," and another called "Thrumming andSinging;" after which she handed back the programme, observing, "Whenthey have done with the 'Ennoblement of two Officers,' which they aresinging just at present, it will be time enough to sing these two."
"Of course it will," retorted madame Wang, "but they should get it overas soon as they can, so as to allow your elder Brother and yourSister-in-law to have rest; besides, their hearts are not at ease."
"You senior ladies don't come often," expostulated Mrs. Yu, "and you andI will derive more enjoyment were we to stay a little longer; it's asyet early in the day!"
Lady Feng stood up and looked downstairs. "Where have all the gentlemengone to?" she inquired.
"The gentlemen have just gone over to the Pavilion of PlenteousEffulgence," replied a matron, who stood by; "they have taken along withthem ten musicians and gone in there to drink their wine."
"It wasn't convenient for them," remarked lady Feng, "to be over here;but who knows what they have again gone to do behind our backs?"
"Could every one," interposed Mrs. Yu, "resemble you, a person of suchpropriety!"
While they indulged in chatting and laughing, the plays they had chosenwere all finished; whereupon the tables were cleared of the wines, andthe repast was served. The meal over, the whole company adjourned intothe garden, and came and sat in the drawing-room. After tea, they atlength gave orders to get ready the carriages, and they took their leaveof Mrs. Yu's mother. Mrs. Yu, attended by all the secondary wives,servants, and married women, escorted them out, while Chia Chen, alongwith the whole bevy of young men, stood by the vehicles, waiting in agroup for their arrival.
After saluting mesdames Hsing and Wang, "Aunts," they said, "you mustcome over again to-morrow for a stroll."
"We must be excused," observed madame Wang, "we've sat here the wholeday to-day, and are, after all, feeling quite tired; besides, we shallneed to have some rest to-morrow."
Both of them thereupon got into their carriages and took theirdeparture, while Chia Jui still kept a fixed gaze upon lady Feng; and itwas after Chia Chen had gone in that Li Kuei led round the horse, andthat Pao-y� mounted and went off, following in the track of mesdamesHsing and Wang.
Chia Chen and the whole number of brothers and nephews belonging to thefamily had, during this interval, partaken of their meal, and the wholeparty at length broke up. But in like manner, all the inmates of theclan and the guests spent on the morrow another festive day, but we neednot advert to it with any minuteness.
After this occasion, lady Feng came in person and paid frequent visitsto Mrs. Ch'in; but as there were some days on which her ailment wasconsiderably better, and others on which it was considerably worse, ChiaChen, Mrs. Yu, and Chia Jung were in an awful state of anxiety.
Chia Jui, it must moreover be noticed, came over, on several instances,on a visit to the Jung mansion; but it invariably happened that he foundthat lady Feng had gone over to the Ning mansion.
This was just the thirtieth of the eleventh moon, the day on which thewinter solstice fell; and the few days preceding that season, dowagerlady Chia, madame Wang and lady Feng did not let one day go by withoutsending some one to inquire about Mrs. Ch'in; and as the servants, ontheir return, repeatedly reported that, during the last few days,neither had her ailment aggravated, nor had it undergone any markedimprovement, madame Wang explained to dowager lady Chia, that as acomplaint of this nature had reached this kind of season without gettingany worse, there was some hope of recovery.
"Of course there is!" observed the old lady; "what a dear child she is!should anything happen to her, won't it be enough to make people diefrom grief!" and as she spake she felt for a time quite sore at heart."You and she," continuing, she said to lady Feng, "have been friends forever so long; to-morrow is the glorious first (and you can't go), butafter to-morrow you should pay her a visit and minutely scrutinise herappearance: and should you find her any better, come and tell me on yourreturn! Whatever things that dear child has all along a fancy for, dosend her round a few even as often as you can by some one or other!"
Lady Feng assented to each of her recommendations; and when the secondarrived, she came, after breakfast, to the Ning mansion to see how Mrs.Ch'in was getting on; and though she found her none the worse, the fleshall over her face and person had however become emaciated and parchedup. She readily sat with Mrs. Ch'in for a long while, and after they hadchatted on one thing and another, she again reiterated the assurancesthat this illness involved no danger, and distracted her for ever solong.
"Whether I get well or not," observed Mrs. Ch'in, "we'll know in spring;now winter is just over, and I'm anyhow no worse, so that possibly I mayget all right; and yet there's no saying; but, my dear sister-in-law, dopress our old lady to compose her mind! yesterday, her ladyship sent mesome potato dumplings, with minced dates in them, and though I had two,they seem after all to be very easily digested!"
"I'll send you round some more to-morrow," lady Feng suggested; "I'm nowgoing to look up your mother-in-law, and will then hurry back to give myreport to our dowager lady."
"Please, sister-in-law," Mrs. Ch'in said, "present my best respects toher venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang."
Lady Feng signified that she would comply with her wishes, and,forthwith leaving the apartment, she came over and sat in Mrs. Yu'ssuite of rooms.
"How do you, who don't see our son's wife very often, happen to findher?" inquired Mrs. Yu.
Lady Feng drooped her head for some time. "There's no help," sheventured, "for this illness! but you should likewise make everysubsequent preparation, for it would also be well if you could scour itaway."
"I've done so much as to secretly give orders," replied Mrs. Yu, "to getthings ready; but for that thing (the coffin), there's no good timber tobe found, so that it will have to be looked after by and by."
Lady Feng swallowed hastily a cup of tea, and after a short chat, "Imust be hurrying back," she remarked, "to deliver my message to ourdowager lady!"
"You should," urged Mrs. Yu, "be sparse in what you tell her lady shipso as not to frighten an old person like her!"
"I know well enough what to say," replied lady Feng.
Without any further delay, lady Feng then sped back. On her arrival athome she looked up the old lady. "Brother Jung's wife," she explained,"presents her compliments, and pays obeisance to your venerableladyship; she says that she's much better, and entreats you, her worthysenior, to set your mind at ease! That as soon as she's a little bettershe will come and prostrate herself before your ladyship."
"How do you find her?" inquired dowager lady Chia.
"For the present there's nothing to fear," continued lady Feng; "for hermien is still good."
After the old lady had heard these words, she was plunged for a longwhile in deep reflection; and as she turned towards lady Feng, "Go anddivest yourself of your toilette," she said, "and have some rest."
Lady Feng in consequence signified her obedience, and walked away,returning home after paying madame Wang a visit. P'ing Erh helped ladyFeng to put on the house costume, which she had warmed by the fire, andlady Feng eventually took a seat and asked "whether there was anythingdoing at home?"
P'ing Erh then brought the tea, and after going over to hand the cup:"There's nothing doing," she replied; "as regards the interest on thethree hundred taels, Wang Erh's wife has brought it in, and I've put itaway. Besides this, Mr. Jui sent round to inquire if your ladyship wasat home or not, as he meant to come and pay his respects and to have achat."
"Heng!" exclaimed lady Feng at these words. "Why should this beastcompass his own death? we'll see when he comes what is to be done."
"Why is this Mr. Jui so bent upon coming?' P'ing Erh having inquired,lady Feng readily gave her an account of how she had met him in thecourse of the ninth moon in the Ning mansion, and of what had been saidby him.
"What a mangy frog to be bent upon eating the flesh of a heavenlygoose!" ejaculated P'ing Erh. "A stupid and disorderly fellow with noconception of relationship, to harbour such a thought! but we'll makehim find an unnatural death!"
"Wait till he comes," added lady Feng, "when I feel certain I shall findsome way."
What happened, however, when Chia Jui came has not, as yet, beenascertained, but listen, reader, to the explanation given in the nextchapter.

CHAPTER XII.
  Wang Hsi-feng maliciously lays a trap for Chia Jui, under pretence      that his affection is reciprocated.  Chia T'ien-hsiang gazes at the face of the mirror of Voluptuousness.
Lady Feng, it must be noticed in continuation of our narrative, was justengaged in talking with P'ing Erh, when they heard some one announcethat Mr. Jui had come. Lady Feng gave orders that he should be invitedto step in, and Chia Jui perceiving that he had been asked to walk inwas at heart elated at the prospect of seeing her.
With a face beaming with smiles, Lady Feng inquired again and again howhe was; and, with simulated tenderness she further pressed him to take aseat and urged him to have a cup of tea.
Chia Jui noticed how still more voluptuous lady Feng looked in herpresent costume, and, as his eyes burnt with love, "How is it," heinquired, "that my elder brother Secundus is not yet back?"
"What the reason is I cannot tell," lady Feng said by way of reply.
"May it not be," Chia Jui smilingly insinuated, "that some fair damselhas got hold of him on the way, and that he cannot brook to tear himselffrom her to come home?"
"That makes it plain that there are those among men who fall in lovewith any girl they cast their eyes on," hinted lady Feng.
"Your remarks are, sister-in-law, incorrect, for I'm none of this kind!"Chia Jui explained smirkingly.
"How many like you can there be!" rejoined lady Feng with a sarcasticsmile; "in ten, not one even could be picked out!"
When Chia Jui heard these words, he felt in such high glee that herubbed his ears and smoothed his cheeks. "My sister-in-law," hecontinued, "you must of course be extremely lonely day after day."
"Indeed I am," observed lady Feng, "and I only wish some one would comeand have a chat with me to break my dull monotony."
"I daily have ample leisure," Chia Jui ventured with a simper, "andwouldn't it be well if I came every day to dispel your dulness,sister-in-law?"
"You are simply fooling me," exclaimed lady Feng laughing. "It isn'tlikely you would wish to come over here to me?"
"If in your presence, sister-in-law, I utter a single word of falsehood,may the thunder from heaven blast me!" protested Chia Jui. "It's onlybecause I had all along heard people say that you were a dreadfulperson, and that you cannot condone even the slightest shortcomingcommitted in your presence, that I was induced to keep back by fear; butafter seeing you, on this occasion, so chatty, so full of fun and mostconsiderate to others, how can I not come? were it to be the cause of mydeath, I would be even willing to come!"
"You're really a clever person," lady Feng observed sarcastically. "Andoh so much superior to both Chia Jung and his brother! Handsome as theirpresence was to look at, I imagined their minds to be full ofintelligence, but who would have thought that they would, after all, bea couple of stupid worms, without the least notion of human affection!"
The words which Chia Jui heard, fell in so much the more with his ownsentiments, that he could not restrain himself from again pressingforward nearer to her; and as with eyes strained to give intentness tohis view, he gazed at lady Feng's purse: "What rings have you got on?"he went on to ask.
"You should be a little more deferential," remonstrated lady Feng in alow tone of voice, "so as not to let the waiting-maids detect us."
Chia Jui withdrew backward with as much alacrity as if he had receivedan Imperial decree or a mandate from Buddha.
"You ought to be going!" lady Feng suggested, as she gave him a smile.
"Do let me stay a while longer," entreated Chia Jui, "you are indeedruthless, my sister-in-law."
But with gentle voice did lady Feng again expostulate. "In broaddaylight," she said, "with people coming and going, it is not reallyconvenient that you should abide in here; so you had better go, and whenit's dark and the watch is set, you can come over, and quietly wait forme in the corridor on the Eastern side!"
At these words, Chia Jui felt as if he had received some jewel orprecious thing. "Don't make fun of me!" he remarked with vehemence. "Theonly thing is that crowds of people are ever passing from there, and howwill it be possible for me to evade detection?"
"Set your mind at ease!" lady Feng advised; "I shall dismiss on leaveall the youths on duty at night; and when the doors, on both sides, areclosed, there will be no one else to come in!"
Chia Jui was delighted beyond measure by the assurance, and withimpetuous haste, he took his leave and went off; convinced at heart ofthe gratification of his wishes. He continued, up to the time of dusk, aprey to keen expectation; and, when indeed darkness fell, he felt hisway into the Jung mansion, availing himself of the moment, when thedoors were being closed, to slip into the corridor, where everything wasactually pitch dark, and not a soul to be seen going backwards orforwards.
The door leading over to dowager lady Chia's apartments had already beenput under key, and there was but one gate, the one on the East, whichhad not as yet been locked. Chia Jui lent his ear, and listened for everso long, but he saw no one appear. Suddenly, however, was heard a soundlike "lo teng," and the east gate was also bolted; but though Chia Juiwas in a great state of impatience, he none the less did not venture toutter a sound. All that necessity compelled him to do was to issue, withquiet steps, from his corner, and to try the gates by pushing; but theywere closed as firmly as if they had been made fast with iron bolts; andmuch though he may, at this juncture, have wished to find his way out,escape was, in fact, out of the question; on the south and north was onecontinuous dead wall, which, even had he wished to scale, there wasnothing which he could clutch and pull himself up by.
This room, besides, was one the interior (of which was exposed) to thewind, which entered through (the fissure) of the door; and was perfectlyempty and bare; and the weather being, at this time, that of December,and the night too very long, the northerly wind, with its biting gusts,was sufficient to penetrate the flesh and to cleave the bones, so thatthe whole night long he had a narrow escape from being frozen to death;and he was yearning, with intolerable anxiety for the break of day, whenhe espied an old matron go first and open the door on the East side, andthen come in and knock at the western gate.
Chia Jui seeing that she had turned her face away, bolted out, like astreak of smoke, as he hugged his shoulders with his hands (from intensecold.) As luck would have it, the hour was as yet early, so that theinmates of the house had not all got out of bed; and making his escapefrom the postern door, he straightaway betook himself home, running backthe whole way.
Chia Jui's parents had, it must be explained, departed life at an earlyperiod, and he had no one else, besides his grandfather Tai-ju, to takecharge of his support and education. This Tai-ju had, all along,exercised a very strict control, and would not allow Chia Jui to evenmake one step too many, in the apprehension that he might gad about outof doors drinking and gambling, to the neglect of his studies.
Seeing, on this unexpected occasion, that he had not come home the wholenight, he simply felt positive, in his own mind, that he was certain tohave run about, if not drinking, at least gambling, and dissipating inhouses of the demi-monde up to the small hours; but he never even gaveso much as a thought to the possibility of a public scandal, as that inwhich he was involved. The consequence was that during the whole lengthof the night he boiled with wrath.
Chia Jui himself, on the other hand, was (in such a state oftrepidation) that he could wipe the perspiration (off his face) byhandfuls; and he felt constrained on his return home, to have recourseto deceitful excuses, simply explaining that he had been at his eldestmaternal uncle's house, and that when it got dark, they kept him tospend the night there.
"Hitherto," remonstrated Tai-ju, "when about to go out of doors, younever ventured to go, on your own hook, without first telling me aboutit, and how is it that yesterday you surreptitiously left the house? forthis offence alone you deserve a beating, and how much more for the lieimposed upon me."
Into such a violent fit of anger did he consequently fly that layinghands on him, he pulled him over and administered to him thirty or fortyblows with a cane. Nor would he allow him to have anything to eat, butbade him remain on his knees in the court conning essays; impressing onhis mind that he would not let him off, before he had made up for thelast ten days' lessons.
Chia Jui had in the first instance, frozen the whole night, and, in thenext place, came in for a flogging. With a stomach, besides, gnawed bythe pangs of hunger, he had to kneel in a place exposed to draftsreading the while literary compositions, so that the hardships he had toendure were of manifold kinds.
Chia Jui's infamous intentions had at this junction undergone no change;but far from his thoughts being even then any idea that lady Feng washumbugging him, he seized, after the lapse of a couple of days, thefirst leisure moments to come again in search of that lady.
Lady Feng pretended to bear him a grudge for his breach of faith, andChia Jui was so distressed that he tried by vows and oaths (to establishhis innocence.) Lady Feng perceiving that he had, of his own accord,fallen into the meshes of the net laid for him, could not but deviseanother plot to give him a lesson and make him know what was right andmend his ways.
With this purpose, she gave him another assignation. "Don't go overthere," she said, "to-night, but wait for me in the empty rooms givingon to a small passage at the back of these apartments of mine. Butwhatever you do, mind don't be reckless."
"Are you in real earnest?" Chia Jui inquired.
"Why, who wants to play with you?" replied lady Feng; "if you don'tbelieve what I say, well then don't come!"
"I'll come, I'll come, yea I'll come, were I even to die!" protestedChia Jui.
"You should first at this very moment get away!" lady Feng havingsuggested, Chia Jui, who felt sanguine that when evening came, successwould for a certainty crown his visit, took at once his departure inanticipation (of his pleasure.)
During this interval lady Feng hastily set to work to dispose of herresources, and to add to her stratagems, and she laid a trap for hervictim; while Chia Jui, on the other hand, was until the shades ofdarkness fell, a prey to incessant expectation.
As luck would have it a relative of his happened to likewise come onthat very night to their house and to only leave after he had dinnerwith them, and at an hour of the day when the lamps had already beenlit; but he had still to wait until his grandfather had retired to restbefore he could, at length with precipitate step, betake himself intothe Jung mansion.
Straightway he came into the rooms in the narrow passage, and waitedwith as much trepidation as if he had been an ant in a hot pan. Hehowever waited and waited, but he saw no one arrive; he listened but noteven the sound of a voice reached his ear. His heart was full of intensefear, and he could not restrain giving way to surmises and suspicion."May it not be," he thought, "that she is not coming again; and that Imay have once more to freeze for another whole night?"
While indulging in these erratic reflections, he discerned some onecoming, looking like a black apparition, who Chia Jui readily concluded,in his mind, must be lady Feng; so that, unmindful of distinguishingblack from white, he as soon as that person arrived in front of him,speedily clasped her in his embrace, like a ravenous tiger pouncing uponits prey, or a cat clawing a rat, and cried: "My darling sister, youhave made me wait till I'm ready to die."
As he uttered these words, he dragged the comer, in his arms, on to thecouch in the room; and while indulging in kisses and protestations ofwarm love, he began to cry out at random epithets of endearment.
Not a sound, however, came from the lips of the other person; and ChiaJui had in the fulness of his passion, exceeded the bounds of timid loveand was in the act of becoming still more affectionate in hisprotestations, when a sudden flash of a light struck his eye, by therays of which he espied Chia Se with a candle in hand, casting the lightround the place, "Who's in this room?" he exclaimed.
"Uncle Jui," he heard some one on the couch explain, laughing, "wastrying to take liberties with me!"
Chia Jui at one glance became aware that it was no other than Chia Jung;and a sense of shame at once so overpowered him that he could findnowhere to hide himself; nor did he know how best to extricate himselffrom the dilemma. Turning himself round, he made an attempt to make goodhis escape, when Chia Se with one grip clutched him in his hold.
"Don't run away," he said; "sister-in-law Lien has already reported yourconduct to madame Wang; and explained that you had tried to make hercarry on an improper flirtation with you; that she had temporised byhaving recourse to a scheme to escape your importunities, and that shehad imposed upon you in such a way as to make you wait for her in thisplace. Our lady was so terribly incensed, that she well-nigh succumbed;and hence it is that she bade me come and catch you! Be quick now andfollow me, and let us go and see her."
After Chia Jui had heard these words, his very soul could not becontained within his body.
"My dear nephew," he entreated, "do tell her that it wasn't I; and I'llshow you my gratitude to-morrow in a substantial manner."
"Letting you off," rejoined Chia Se, "is no difficult thing; but howmuch, I wonder, are you likely to give? Besides, what you now utter withyour lips, there will be no proof to establish; so you had better writea promissory note."
"How could I put what happened in black and white on paper?" observedChia Jui.
"There's no difficulty about that either!" replied Chia Se; "just writean account of a debt due, for losses in gambling, to some one outside;for payment of which you had to raise funds, by a loan of a statednumber of taels, from the head of the house; and that will be all thatis required."
"This is, in fact, easy enough!" Chia Jui having added by way of answer;Chia Se turned round and left the room; and returning with paper andpencils, which had been got ready beforehand for the purpose, he badeChia Jui write. The two of them (Chia Jung and Chia Se) tried, the oneto do a good turn, and the other to be perverse in his insistence; but(Chia Jui) put down no more than fifty taels, and appended hissignature.
Chia Se pocketed the note, and endeavoured subsequently to induce ChiaJung to come away; but Chia Jung was, at the outset, obdurate andunwilling to give in, and kept on repeating; "To-morrow, I'll tell themembers of our clan to look into your nice conduct!"
These words plunged Chia Jui in such a state of dismay, that he evenwent so far as to knock his head on the ground; but, as Chia Se wastrying to get unfair advantage of him though he had at first done him agood turn, he had to write another promissory note for fifty taels,before the matter was dropped.
Taking up again the thread of the conversation, Chia Se remarked, "Nowwhen I let you go, I'm quite ready to bear the blame! But the gate atour old lady's over there is already bolted, and Mr. Chia Cheng is justnow engaged in the Hall, looking at the things which have arrived fromNanking, so that it would certainly be difficult for you to pass throughthat way. The only safe course at present is by the back gate; but ifyou do go by there, and perchance meet any one, even I will be in for amess; so you might as well wait until I go first and have a peep, whenI'll come and fetch you! You couldn't anyhow conceal yourself in thisroom; for in a short time they'll be coming to stow the things away, andyou had better let me find a safe place for you."
These words ended, he took hold of Chia Jui, and, extinguishing againthe lantern, he brought him out into the court, feeling his way up tothe bottom of the steps of the large terrace. "It's safe enough in thisnest," he observed, "but just squat down quietly and don't utter asound; wait until I come back before you venture out."
Having concluded this remark, the two of them (Chia Se and Chia Jung)walked away; while Chia Jui was, all this time, out of his senses, andfelt constrained to remain squatting at the bottom of the terracestairs. He was about to consider what course was open for him to adopt,when he heard a noise just over his head; and, with a splash, thecontents of a bucket, consisting entirely of filthy water, was emptiedstraight down over him from above, drenching, as luck would have it, hiswhole person and head.
Chia Jui could not suppress an exclamation. "Ai ya!" he cried, but hehastily stopped his mouth with his hands, and did not venture to givevent to another sound. His whole head and face were a mass of filth, andhis body felt icy cold. But as he shivered and shook, he espied Chia Secome running. "Get off," he shouted, "with all speed! off with you atonce!"
As soon as Chia Jui returned to life again, he bolted with hastystrides, out of the back gate, and ran the whole way home. The night hadalready reached the third watch, so that he had to knock at the door forit to be opened.
"What's the matter?" inquired the servants, when they saw him in thissorry plight; (an inquiry) which placed him in the necessity of makingsome false excuse. "The night was dark," he explained, "and my footslipped and I fell into a gutter."
Saying this, he betook himself speedily to his own apartment; and it wasonly after he had changed his clothes and performed his ablutions, thathe began to realise that lady Feng had made a fool of him. Heconsequently gave way to a fit of wrath; but upon recalling to mind thecharms of lady Feng's face, he felt again extremely aggrieved that hecould not there and then clasp her in his embrace, and as he indulged inthese wild thoughts and fanciful ideas, he could not the whole nightlong close his eyes.
From this time forward his mind was, it is true, still with lady Feng,but he did not have the courage to put his foot into the Jung mansion;and with Chia Jung and Chia Se both coming time and again to dun him forthe money, he was likewise full of fears lest his grandfather shouldcome to know everything.
His passion for lady Feng was, in fact, already a burden hard to bear,and when, moreover, the troubles of debts were superadded to his tasks,which were also during the whole day arduous, he, a young man of abouttwenty, as yet unmarried, and a prey to constant cravings for lady Feng,which were difficult to gratify, could not avoid giving way, to a greatextent, to such evil habits as exhausted his energies. His lot had, whatis more, been on two occasions to be frozen, angered and to endure muchhardship, so that with the attacks received time and again from allsides, he unconsciously soon contracted an organic disease. In his heartinflammation set in; his mouth lost the sense of taste; his feet got assoft as cotton from weakness; his eyes stung, as if there were vinegarin them. At night, he burnt with fever. During the day, he wasrepeatedly under the effects of lassitude. Perspiration was profuse,while with his expectorations of phlegm, he brought up blood. The wholenumber of these several ailments came upon him, before the expiry of ayear, (with the result that) in course of time, he had not the strengthto bear himself up. Of a sudden, he would fall down, and with his eyes,albeit closed, his spirit would be still plunged in confused dreams,while his mouth would be full of nonsense and he would be subject tostrange starts.
Every kind of doctor was asked to come in, and every treatment hadrecourse to; and, though of such medicines as cinnamon, aconitum seeds,turtle shell, ophiopogon, Y�-ch� herb, and the like, he took severaltens of catties, he nevertheless experienced no change for the better;so that by the time the twelfth moon drew once again to an end, andspring returned, this illness had become still more serious.
Tai-ju was very much concerned, and invited doctors from all parts toattend to him, but none of them could do him any good. And as later on,he had to take nothing else but decoctions of pure ginseng, Tai-ju couldnot of course afford it. Having no other help but to come over to theJung mansion, and make requisition for some, Madame Wang asked lady Fengto weigh two taels of it and give it to him. "The other day," rejoinedlady Feng, "not long ago, when we concocted some medicine for ourdowager lady, you told us, madame, to keep the pieces that were whole,to present to the spouse of General Yang to make physic with, and as ithappens it was only yesterday that I sent some one round with them."
"If there's none over here in our place," suggested madame Wang, "justsend a servant to your mother-in-law's, on the other side, to inquirewhether they have any. Or it may possibly be that your elderbrother-in-law Chen, over there, might have a little. If so, put all youget together, and give it to them; and when he shall have taken it, andgot well and you shall have saved the life of a human being, it willreally be to the benefit of you all."
Lady Feng acquiesced; but without directing a single person to instituteany search, she simply took some refuse twigs, and making up a few mace,she despatched them with the meagre message that they had been sent bymadame Wang, and that there was, in fact, no more; subsequentlyreporting to madame Wang that she had asked for and obtained all therewas and that she had collected as much as two taels, and forwarded it tothem.
Chia Jui was, meanwhile, very anxious to recover his health, so thatthere was no medicine that he would not take, but the outlay of moneywas of no avail, for he derived no benefit.
On a certain day and at an unexpected moment, a lame Taoist priest cameto beg for alms, and he averred that he had the special gift of healingdiseases arising from grievances received, and as Chia Jui happened,from inside, to hear what he said, he forthwith shouted out: "Go atonce, and bid that divine come in and save my life!" while hereverentially knocked his head on the pillow.
The whole bevy of servants felt constrained to usher the Taoist in; andChia Jui, taking hold of him with a dash, "My Buddha!" he repeatedlycried out, "save my life!"
The Taoist heaved a sigh. "This ailment of yours," he remarked, "is notone that could be healed with any medicine; I have a precious thing herewhich I'll give you, and if you gaze at it every day, your life can besaved!"
When he had done talking, he produced from his pouch a looking-glasswhich could reflect a person's face on the front and back as well. Onthe upper part of the back were engraved the four characters: "PreciousMirror of Voluptuousness." Handing it over to Chia Jui: "This object,"he proceeded, "emanates from the primordial confines of the Great Voidand has been wrought by the Monitory Dream Fairy in the Palace ofUnreality and Spirituality, with the sole intent of healing theillnesses which originate from evil thoughts and improper designs.Possessing, as it does, the virtue of relieving mankind and preservinglife, I have consequently brought it along with me into the world, but Ionly give it to those intelligent pre�minent and refined princely men toset their eyes on. On no account must you look at the front side; andyou should only gaze at the back of it; this is urgent, this isexpedient! After three days, I shall come and fetch it away; by whichtime, I'm sure, it will have made him all right."
These words finished, he walked away with leisurely step, and though alltried to detain him, they could not succeed.
Chia Jui received the mirror. "This Taoist," he thought, "would seem tospeak sensibly, and why should I not look at it and try its effect?" Atthe conclusion of these thoughts, he took up the Mirror ofVoluptuousness, and cast his eyes on the obverse side; but uponperceiving nought else than a skeleton standing in it, Chia Juisustained such a fright that he lost no time in covering it with hishands and in abusing the Taoist. "You good-for-nothing!" he exclaimed,"why should you frighten me so? but I'll go further and look at thefront and see what it's like."
While he reflected in this manner, he readily looked into the face ofthe mirror, wherein he caught sight of lady Feng standing, nodding herhead and beckoning to him. With one gush of joy, Chia Jui felt himself,in a vague and mysterious manner, transported into the mirror, where heheld an affectionate t�te-�-t�te with lady Feng. Lady Feng escorted himout again. On his return to bed, he gave vent to an exclamation of "Aiyah!" and opening his eyes, he turned the glass over once more; butstill, as hitherto, stood the skeleton in the back part.
Chia Jui had, it is true, experienced all the pleasant sensations of at�te-�-t�te, but his heart nevertheless did not feel gratified; so thathe again turned the front round, and gazed at lady Feng, as she stillwaved her hand and beckoned to him to go. Once more entering the mirror,he went on in the same way for three or four times, until this occasion,when just as he was about to issue from the mirror, he espied twopersons come up to him, who made him fast with chains round the neck,and hauled him away. Chia Jui shouted. "Let me take the mirror and I'llcome along." But only this remark could he utter, for it was forthwithbeyond his power to say one word more. The servants, who stood by inattendance, saw him at first still holding the glass in his hand andlooking in, and then, when it fell from his grasp, open his eyes againto pick it up, but when at length the mirror dropped, and he at onceceased to move, they in a body came forward to ascertain what hadhappened to him. He had already breathed his last. The lower part of hisbody was icy-cold; his clothes moist from profuse perspiration. With allpromptitude they changed him there and then, and carried him to anotherbed.
Tai-ju and his wife wept bitterly for him, to the utter disregard oftheir own lives, while in violent terms they abused the Taoist priest."What kind of magical mirror is it?" they asked. "If we don't destroythis glass, it will do harm to not a few men in the world!"
Having forthwith given directions to bring fire and burn it, a voice washeard in the air to say, "Who told you to look into the face of it? Youyourselves have mistaken what is false for what is true, and why burnthis glass of mine?"
Suddenly the mirror was seen to fly away into the air; and when Tai-juwent out of doors to see, he found no one else than the limping Taoist,shouting, "Who is he who wishes to destroy the Mirror ofVoluptuousness?" While uttering these words, he snatched the glass, and,as all eyes were fixed upon him, he moved away lissomely, as if swayedby the wind.
Tai-ju at once made preparations for the funeral and went everywhere togive notice that on the third day the obsequies would commence, that onthe seventh the procession would start to escort the coffin to the IronFence Temple, and that on the subsequent day, it would be taken to hisoriginal home.
Not much time elapsed before all the members of the Chia family came, ina body, to express their condolences. Chia She, of the Jung Mansion,presented twenty taels, and Chia Cheng also gave twenty taels. Of theNing Mansion, Chia Chen likewise contributed twenty taels. The remainderof the members of the clan, of whom some were poor and some rich, andnot equally well off, gave either one or two taels, or three or four,some more, some less. Among strangers, there were also contributions,respectively presented by the families of his fellow-scholars,amounting, likewise, collectively to twenty or thirty taels.
The private means of Tai-ju were, it is true, precarious, but with themonetary assistance he obtained, he anyhow performed the funeral riteswith all splendour and �clat.
But who would have thought it, at the close of winter of this year, LinJu-hai contracted a serious illness, and forwarded a letter, by someone, with the express purpose of fetching Lin Tai-y� back. Thesetidings, when they reached dowager lady Chia, naturally added to thegrief and distress (she already suffered), but she felt compelled tomake speedy preparations for Tai-y�'s departure. Pao-y� too wasintensely cut up, but he had no alternative but to defer to theaffection of father and daughter; nor could he very well place anyhindrance in the way.
Old lady Chia, in due course, made up her mind that she would like ChiaLien to accompany her, and she also asked him to bring her back againalong with him. But no minute particulars need be given of the manifoldlocal presents and of the preparations, which were, of course,everything that could be wished for in excellence and perfectness.Forthwith the day for starting was selected, and Chia Lien, along withLin Tai-y�, said good-bye to all the members of the family, and,followed by their attendants, they went on board their boats, and setout on their journey for Yang Chou.
But, Reader, should you have any wish to know fuller details, listen tothe account given in the subsequent Chapter.

CHAPTER XIII.
  Ch'in K'o-ch'ing dies, and Chia Jung is invested with the rank of      military officer to the Imperial Body-guard.  Wang Hsi-feng lends her help in the management of the Jung Kuo      Mansion.
Lady Feng, it must be added, in prosecuting our narrative, was eversince Chia Lien's departure to accompany Tai-y� to Yang Chou, reallyvery dejected at heart; and every day, when evening came, she would,after simply indulging in a chat and a laugh with P'ing Erh, turn in, ina heedless frame of mind, for the night.
In the course of the night of this day, she had been sitting with P'ingErh by lamp-light clasping the hand-stove; and weary of doing her workof embroidery, she had at an early hour, given orders to warm theembroidered quilt, and both had gone to bed; and as she was bending herfingers, counting the progress of the journey, and when they should bearriving, unexpectedly, the third watch struck.
P'ing Erh had already fallen fast asleep; and lady Feng was feeling atlength her sleepy eyes slightly dose, when she faintly discerned Mrs.Ch'in walk in from outside.
"My dear sister-in-law," she said as she smiled, "sleep in peace; I'm onmy way back to-day, and won't even you accompany me just one stage? Butas you and I have been great friends all along, I cannot part from you,sister-in-law, and have therefore come to take my leave of you. Thereis, besides, a wish of mine, which isn't yet accomplished; and if Idon't impart it to you, it isn't likely that telling any one else willbe of any use."
Lady Feng could not make out the sense of the words she heard. "Whatwish is it you have?" she inquired, "do tell me, and it will be safeenough with me."
"You are, my dear sister-in-law, a heroine among women," observed Mrs.Ch'in, "so much so that those famous men, with sashes and official hats,cannot excel you; how is it that you're not aware of even a couple oflines of common adages, of that trite saying, 'when the moon is full, itbegins to wane; when the waters are high, they must overflow?' and ofthat other which says that 'if you ascend high, heavy must be yourfall.' Our family has now enjoyed splendour and prosperity for alreadywell-nigh a century, but a day comes when at the height of good fortune,calamity arises; and if the proverb that 'when the tree falls, themonkeys scatter,' be fulfilled, will not futile have been the reputationof culture and old standing of a whole generation?"
Lady Feng at these words felt her heart heavy, and overpowered byintense awe and veneration.
"The fears you express are well founded," she urgently remarked, "butwhat plan is there adequate to preserve it from future injury?"
"My dear sister-in-law," rejoined Mrs. Ch'in with a sardonic smile,"you're very simple indeed! When woe has reached its climax, wealsupervenes. Prosperity and adversity, from days of yore up to thepresent time, now pass away, and now again revive, and how can(prosperity) be perpetuated by any human exertion? But if now, we couldin the time of good fortune, make provision against any worldlyconcerns, which might arise at any season of future adversity, we mightin fact prolong and preserve it. Everything, for instance, is at presentwell-regulated; but there are two matters which are not on a surefooting, and if such and such suitable action could be adopted withregard to these concerns, it will, in subsequent days, be found easy toperpetuate the family welfare in its entity."
"What matters are these?" inquired lady Feng.
"Though at the graves of our ancestors," explained Mrs. Ch'in,"sacrifices and oblations be offered at the four seasons, there'snevertheless no fixed source of income. In the second place, the familyschool is, it is true, in existence; but it has no definitegrants-in-aid. According to my views, now that the times are prosperous,there's, as a matter of course, no lack of offerings and contributions;but by and bye, when reverses set in, whence will these two outlays bemet from? Would it not be as well, and my ideas are positive on thisscore, to avail ourselves of the present time, when riches and honoursstill reign, to establish in the immediate vicinity of our ancestraltombs, a large number of farms, cottages, and estates, in order toenable the expenditure for offerings and grants to entirely emanate fromthis source? And if the household school were also established on thisprinciple, the old and young in the whole clan can, after they have, bycommon consent, determined upon rules, exercise in days to come control,in the order of the branches, over the affairs connected with the landedproperty, revenue, ancestral worship and school maintenance for the year(of their respective term.) Under this rotatory system, there willlikewise be no animosities; neither will there be any mortgages, orsales, or any of these numerous malpractices; and should any one happento incur blame, his personal effects can be confiscated by Government.But the properties, from which will be derived the funds for ancestralworship, even the officials should not be able to appropriate, so thatwhen reverses do supervene, the sons and grandsons of the family may beable to return to their homes, and prosecute their studies, or go in forfarming. Thus, while they will have something to fall back upon, theancestral worship will, in like manner, be continued in perpetuity. But,if the present affluence and splendour be looked upon as bound to go onwithout intermission, and with no thought for the day to come, noenduring plan be after all devised, presently, in a little while, therewill, once again, transpire a felicitous occurrence of exceptional kind,which, in point of fact, will resemble the splendour of oil scorched ona violent fire, or fresh flowers decorated with brocades. You shouldbear in mind that it will also be nothing more real than a transientpageant, nothing but a short-lived pleasure! Whatever you do, don'tforget the proverb, that 'there's no banquet, however sumptuous, fromwhich the guests do not disperse;' and unless you do, at an early date,take precautions against later evils, regret will, I apprehend, be of noavail."
"What felicitous occurrence will take place?" lady Feng inquired withalacrity.
"The decrees of Heaven cannot be divulged; but as I have been veryfriendly with you, sister-in-law, for so long, I will present you,before I take my leave, with two lines, which it behoves you to keep inmind," rejoined Mrs. Ch'in, as she consequently proceeded to recite whatfollows:
  The three springs, when over, all radiance will wane;  The inmates to seek each a home will be fain.
Lady Feng was bent upon making further inquiries, when she heard amessenger at the second gate strike the "cloudy board" four consecutiveblows. It was indeed the announcement of a death; and it woke up ladyFeng with a start. A servant reported that lady Jung of the easternmansion was no more.
Lady Feng was so taken aback that a cold perspiration broke out all overher person, and she fell for a while into vacant abstraction. But shehad to change her costume, with all possible haste, and to come over tomadame Wang's apartments.
By this time, all the members of the family were aware of the tidings,and there was not one of them who did not feel disconsolate; one and allof them were much wounded at heart. The elder generation bethoughtthemselves of the dutiful submission which she had all along displayed;those of the same age as herself reflected upon the friendship andintimacy which had ever existed with her; those younger than herremembered her past benevolence. Even the servants of the household,whether old or young, looked back upon her qualities of sympathy withthe poor, pity of the destitute, affection for the old, andconsideration for the young; and not one of them all was there who didnot mourn her loss, and give way to intense grief.
But these irrelevant details need not be dilated upon; suffice it toconfine ourselves to Pao-y�.
Consequent upon Lin Tai-y�'s return home, he was left to his own selfand felt very lonely. Neither would he go and disport himself withothers; but with the daily return of dusk, he was wont to retire quietlyto sleep.
On this day, while he was yet under the influence of a dream, he heardthe announcement of Mrs. Ch'in's death, and turning himself roundquickly he crept out of bed, when he felt as if his heart had beenstabbed with a sword. With a sudden retch, he straightway expectorated amouthful of blood, which so frightened Hsi Jen and the rest that theyrushed forward and supported him.
"What is the matter?" they inquired, and they meant also to go and letdowager lady Chia know, so as to send for a doctor, but Pao-y� dissuadedthem.
"There's no need of any flurry; it's nothing at all," he said, "it'ssimply that the fire of grief has attacked the heart, and that the blooddid not circulate through the arteries."
As he spoke, he speedily raised himself up, and, after asking for hisclothes and changing, he came over to see dowager lady Chia. His wishwas to go at once to the other side; and Hsi Jen, though feeling uneasyat heart, seeing the state of mind he was in, did not again hinder him,as she felt constrained to let him please himself.
When old lady Chia saw that he was bent upon going: "The breath is justgone out of the body," she consequently remonstrated, "and that side isstill sullied. In the second place it's now dark, and the wind is high;so you had better wait until to-morrow morning, when you will be inample time."
Pao-y� would not agree to this, and dowager lady Chia gave orders to getthe carriage ready, and to depute a few more attendants and followers togo with him. Under this escort he went forward and straightway arrivedin front of the Ning mansion, where they saw the main entrance wideopen, the lamps on the two sides giving out a light as bright as day,and people coming and going in confused and large numbers; while thesound of weeping inside was sufficient to shake the mountains and tomove the hills.
Pao-y� dismounted from the carriage; and with hurried step, walked intothe apartment, where the coffin was laid. He gave vent to bitter tearsfor a few minutes, and subsequently paid his salutations to Mrs. Yu.Mrs. Yu, as it happened, had just had a relapse of her old complaint ofpains in the stomach and was lying on her bed.
He eventually came out again from her chamber to salute Chia Chen, justat the very moment that Chia Tai-ju, Chia Tai-hsiu, Chia Ch'ih, ChiaoHsiao, Chia Tun, Chia She, Chia Cheng, Chia Tsung, Chia Pin, Chia Hsing,Chia Kuang, Chia Shen, Chia Ch'iung, Chia Lin, Chia Se, Chia Ch'ang,Chia Ling, Chia Y�n, Chia Ch'in, Chia Chen, Chia P'ing, Chia Tsao, ChiaHeng, Chia Fen, Chia Fang, Chia Lan, Chia Chun, Chia Chih and the otherrelatives of the families had likewise arrived in a body.
Chia Chen wept so bitterly that he was like a man of tears. "Of thewhole family, whether young or old, distant relatives or close friends,"he was just explaining to Chia Tai-ju and the rest, "who did not knowthat this girl was a hundred times better than even our son? but nowthat her spirit has retired, it's evident that this elder branch of thefamily will be cut off and that there will be no survivor."
While he gave vent to these words, he again burst into tears, and thewhole company of relatives set to work at once to pacify him. "She hasalready departed this life," they argued, "and tears are also of noavail, besides the pressing thing now is to consult as to what kind ofarrangements are to be made."
Chia Chen clapped his hands. "What arrangements are to be made!" heexclaimed; "nothing is to be done, but what is within my means."
As they conversed, they perceived Ch'in Yeh and Ch'in Chung, as well asseveral relations of Mrs. Yu, arrive, together with Mrs. Yu's sisters;and Chia Chen forthwith bade Chia Ch'ung, Chia Shen, Chia Lin and ChiaSe, the four of them, to go and entertain the guests; while he, at thesame time, issued directions to go and ask the Astrologer of theImperial Observatory to come and choose the days for the ceremonies.
(This Astrologer) decided that the coffin should remain in the house forseven times seven days, that is forty-nine days; that after the thirdday, the mourning rites should be begun and the formal cards should bedistributed; that all that was to be done during these forty-nine dayswas to invite one hundred and eight Buddhist bonzes to perform, in themain Hall, the High Confession Mass, in order to ford the souls ofdeparted relatives across the abyss of suffering, and afterwards totransmute the spirit (of Mrs. Ch'in); that, in addition, an altar shouldbe erected in the Tower of Heavenly Fragrance, where nine times ninevirtuous Taoist priests should, for nineteen days, offer up prayers forabsolution from punishment, and purification from retribution. Thatafter these services, the tablet should be moved into the Garden ofConcentrated Fragrance, and that in the presence of the tablet, fifteenadditional eminent bonzes and fifteen renowned Taoist Priests shouldconfront the altar and perform meritorious deeds every seven days.
The news of the death of the wife of his eldest grandson reached ChiaChing; but as he himself felt sure that, at no distant date, he wouldascend to the regions above, he was loth to return again to his home,and so expose himself to the contamination of the world, as tocompletely waste the meritorious excellence acquired in past days. Forthis reason, he paid no heed to the event, but allowed Chia Chen a freehand to accomplish the necessary preparations.
Chia Chen, to whom we again revert, was fond of display andextravagance, so that he found, on inspection of coffins, those few madeof pine-wood unsuitable to his taste; when, strange coincidence, Hs�ehP'an came to pay his visit of condolence, and perceiving that Chia Chenwas in quest of a good coffin: "In our establishment," he readilysuggested, "we have a lot of timber of some kind or other called Ch'iangwood, which comes from the T'ieh Wang Mount, in Huang Hai; and whichmade into coffins will not rot, not for ten thousand years. This lotwas, in fact, brought down, some years back, by my late father; and hadat one time been required by His Highness I Chung, a Prince of the royalblood; but as he became guilty of some mismanagement, it was, inconsequence, not used, and is still lying stored up in ourestablishment; and another thing besides is that there's no one with themeans to purchase it. But if you do want it, you should come and have alook at it."
Chia Chen, upon hearing this, was extremely delighted, and gave ordersthat the planks should be there and then brought over. When the wholefamily came to inspect them, they found those for the sides and thebottom to be all eight inches thick, the grain like betel-nut, the smelllike sandal-wood or musk, while, when tapped with the hand, the soundemitted was like that of precious stones; so that one and all agreed inpraising the timber for its remarkable quality.
"What is their price?" Chia Chen inquired with a smile.
"Even with one thousand taels in hand," explained Hs�eh P'an laughingly,"I feel sure you wouldn't find any place, where you could buy the like.Why ask about price? if you just give the workmen a few taels for theirlabour, it will be quite sufficient."
Chia Chen, at these words, lost no time in giving expression to profuseassurances of gratitude, and was forthwith issuing directions that thetimber should be split, sawn and made up, when Chia Cheng proffered hisadvice. "Such articles shouldn't," he said, "be, in my idea, enjoyed bypersons of the common run; it would be quite ample if the body wereplaced in a coffin made of pine of the best quality."
But Chia Chen would not listen to any suggestion.
Suddenly he further heard that Mrs. Ch'in's waiting-maid, Jui Chu byname, had, after she had become alive to the fact that her mistress haddied, knocked her head against a post, and likewise succumbed to theblows. This unusual occurrence the whole clan extolled in high terms;and Chia Chen promptly directed that, with regard to ceremonies, sheshould be treated as a granddaughter, and that the body should, after ithad been placed in the coffin, be also deposited in the Hall of AttainedImmortality, in the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.
There was likewise a young waiting-maid, called Pao Chu, who, as Mrs.Ch'in left no issue, was willing to become an adopted child, and beggedto be allowed to undertake the charge of dashing the mourning bowl, andaccompanying the coffin; which pleased Chia Chen so much that hespeedily transmitted orders that from that time forth Pao Chu should beaddressed by all as 'young miss.'
Pao Chu, after the rites of an unmarried daughter, mourned before thecoffin to such an unwonted degree, as if bent upon snapping her ownlife; while the members of the entire clan, as well as the inmates ofthe Mansions, each and all, readily observed, in their conduct, theestablished mourning usages, without of course any transgression orconfusion.
"Chia Jung," pondered Chia Chen, "has no higher status than that ofgraduate by purchase, and were this designation written on the funeralstreamer, it will not be imposing, and, in point of fact, the retinuewill likewise be small." He therefore was exceedingly unhappy, in hisown mind, when, as luck would have it, on this day, which was the fourthday of the first seven, Tai Ch'�an, a eunuch of the Palace of HighRenown, whose office was that of Palace Overseer, first preparedsacrificial presents, which he sent round by messengers, and next camehimself in an official chair, preceded by criers beating the gong, tooffer sacrificial oblations.
Chia Chen promptly received him, and pressed him into a seat; and whenthey adjourned into the Hall of the Loitering Bees, tea was presented.
Chia Chen had already arrived at a fixed purpose, so that he seized anopportunity to tell him of his wish to purchase an office for ChiaJung's advancement.
Tai Ch'�an understood the purport of his remark. "It is, I presume," headded smilingly, "that the funeral rites should be a little moresumptuous."
"My worthy sir," eagerly rejoined Chia Chen, "your surmise on that scoreis perfectly correct."
"The question," explained Tai Ch'�an, "comes up at an opportune moment;for there is just at present a good vacancy. Of the three hundredofficers who at present constitute the Imperial Body Guard, there aretwo wanting. Yesterday marquis Hsiang Yang's third brother came toappeal to me with one thousand five hundred taels of ready money, whichhe brought over to my house. You know the friendship of old standingwhich exists between him and me, so that, placing other considerationsaside, I without a second thought, assented for his father's sake. Butthere still remains another vacancy, which, who would have thought it,fat general Feng, of Yung Hsing, asked to purchase for his son; but Ihave had no time to give him an answer. Besides, as our child wants topurchase it, you had better at once write a statement of hisantecedents."
Chia Chen lost no time in bidding some one write the statement on redpaper, which Tai Ch'�an found, on perusal, to record that Chia Jung wasa graduate, by purchase, of the District of Chiang Ning, of the YingT'ien Prefecture, in Chiang Nan; that Chia Tai-hua, his greatgrandfather, had been Commander-in-Chief of the Metropolitan Camp, andan hereditary general of the first class, with the prefix of SpiritualMajesty; that his grandfather Chia Ching was a metropolitan graduate ofthe tripos in the Ping Ch'en year; and that his father Chia Chen hadinherited a rank of nobility of the third degree, and was a general,with the prefix of Majestic Intrepidity.
Tai Ch'�an, after perusal, turned his hand behind him and passed (thestatement) to a constant attendant of his, to put away: "Go back," heenjoined him, "and give it to His Excellency Mr. Chao, at the head ofthe Board of Revenue, and tell him, that I present him my compliments,and would like him to draw up a warrant for subaltern of the ImperialBody Guard of the fifth grade, and to also issue a commission; that heshould take the particulars from this statement and fill them up; andthat to-morrow I'll come and have the money weighed and sent over."
The young attendant signified his obedience, and Tai Ch'�an thereupontook his leave. Chia Chen did all he could to detain him, but with nosuccess; so that he had no alternative but to escort him as far as theentrance of the Mansion. As he was about to mount into his chair, ChiaChen inquired, "As regards the money, shall I go and pay it into theBoard, or am I to send it to the Board of Eunuchs?"
"If you were to go and pay it at the Board," observed Tai Ch'�an; "youare sure to suffer loss; so that it would be better if you just weighedexactly one thousand taels and sent them over to my place; for then anend will be put to all trouble."
Chia Chen was incessant in his expression of gratitude. "When the periodof mourning has expired," he consequently added, "I shall lead inperson, my despicable eldest son to your mansion, to pay our obeisance,and express our thanks."
They then parted company, but close upon this, were heard again thevoices of runners. It was, in fact, the spouse of Shih Ting, the marquisof Chung Ching, who was just arriving. Shih Hsiang-yun, mesdames Wang,and Hsing, lady Feng and the rest came out at once, to greet her, andlead her into the Main Building; when they further saw the sacrificialpresents of the three families, of the marquis of Chin Hsiang, themarquis of Ch'uan Ning, and the earl of Shou Shan, likewise spread outin front of the tablet.
In a short while, these three noblemen descended from their chairs, andChia Chen received them in the Large Hall. In like manner all therelatives and friends arrived in such quick succession, one coming,another going, that it is impossible to remember even so much as theirnumber. One thing need be said that during these forty-nine days thestreet on which the Ning Kuo mansion stood, was covered with a sheet ofwhite, formed by the people, coming and going; and thronged withclusters of flowers, as the officials came and went.
At the instance of Chia Chen, Chia Jung, the next day donned his galadress and went over for his papers; and on his return the articles inuse in front of the coffin, as well as those belonging to the cortegeand other such things, were all regulated by the rules prescribed for anofficial status of the fifth degree; while, on the tablet and noticealike the inscription consisted of: Spirit of lady Ch'in, (by marriage)of the Chia mansion, and by patent a lady of the fifth rank (of thetitles of honour).
The main entrance of the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, adjoining thestreet, was opened wide; and on both sides were raised sheds for themusicians, and two companies of players, dressed in blue, discoursedmusic at the proper times; while one pair after another of theparaphernalia was drawn out so straight as if cut by a knife or slit byan axe. There were also two large carmine boards, carved with giltinscriptions, erected outside the gate; the designations in boldcharacters on the upper sides being: Guard of the Imperial Antechamber,charged with the protection of the Inner Palace and Roads, in the RedProhibited City.
On the opposite side, facing each other, rose, high above the ground,two altars for the services of the Buddhist and Taoist priests, while aplacard bore the inscription in bold type: Funeral Obsequies of ladyCh'in, (by marriage) of the Chia mansion, by patent a lady of the fifthrank, consort of the eldest grandson of the hereditary duke of Ning Kuo,and guard of the Imperial Antechamber, charged with the protection ofthe Inner Palace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City. We, Wan Hs�, byHeaven's commands charged with the perennial preservation of perfectpeace in the Kingdom of the Four Continents, as well as of the landscontained therein, Head Controller of the School of Void and Asceticism,and Superior in Chief (of the Buddhist hierarchy); and Yeh Sheng,Principal Controller, since the creation, of the Disciples of PerfectExcellence and Superior in Chief (of the Taoist priesthood), and others,having in a reverent spirit purified ourselves by abstinence, now raiseour eyes up to Heaven, prostrate ourselves humbly before Buddha, anddevoutly pray all the Chia Lans, Chieh Tis, Kung Ts'aos and otherdivinities to extend their sacred bounties, and from afar to displaytheir spiritual majesty, during the forty-nine days (of the funeralrites), for the deliverance from judgment and the absolution fromretribution (of the spirit of lady Ch'in), so that it may enjoy apeaceful and safe passage, whether by sea or by land; and other suchprayers to this effect, which are in fact not worth the trouble ofputting on record.
Chia Chen had, it is true, all his wishes gratified; but, as his wifewas laid up in the inner chambers, with a relapse of her old complaint,and was not in a fit state to undertake the direction of the ceremonies,he was very much distressed lest, when the high officials (and theirwives) came and went, there should occur any breach of the prescribedconventionalities, which he was afraid would evoke ridicule. Hence itwas that he felt in low spirits; but while he was plunged in solicitudePao-y�, who happened to be close by, readily inquired, "Everything maybe safely looked upon as being satisfactorily settled, and why need you,elder brother, still be so full of concern?"
Chia Chen forthwith explained to him how it was that in the ladies'apartments there was no one (to do the honours), but Pao-y� at thesewords smiled: "What difficulty is there about it?" he remarked; "I'llrecommend some one to take temporary charge of the direction of thingsfor you during the month, and I can guarantee that everything will beproperly carried out."
"Who is it?" Chia Chen was quick to ask; but as Pao-y� perceived thatthere were still too many relatives and friends seated around, he didnot feel as if he could very well speak out; so that he went up to ChiaChen and whispered a couple of remarks in his ear.
Chia Chen's joy knew no bounds when he heard this suggestion."Everything will indeed be properly carried out," he added laughingly;"but I must now be going at once."
With these words, he drew Pao-y� along, and taking leave of the wholenumber of visitors, they forthwith came into the drawing rooms.
This day was luckily not a grand occasion, so that few relatives andfriends had come. In the inner apartments there were only a small numberof ladies of close kinship. Mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng, andthe women of the whole household, were entertaining the guests, whenthey heard a servant announce that Mr. Chia Chen had come. (Thisannouncement) took the whole body of ladies and young ladies so much bysurprise, that, with a rushing sound, they tried to hide in the backrooms; but they were not quick enough (to effect their escape).
Lady Feng alone composedly stood up. Chia Chen was himself at this timerather unwell, and being also very much cut up, he entered the roomshuffling along, propping himself up with a staff.
"You are not well?" therefore remarked madame Hsing and the others, "andyou've had besides so much to attend to during these consecutive days,that what you require is rest to get all right; and why do you againcome over?"
Chia Chen was, as he leant on his staff, straining every nerve to bendhis body so as to fall on his knees and pay his respects to them, andexpress his sense of obligation for the trouble they had taken, whenmadame Hsing and the other ladies hastily called Pao-y� to raise him up,bidding a servant move a chair for him to sit on. Chia Chen would nottake a seat; but making an effort to return a smile, "Your nephew," heurged, "has come over, as there's a favour that I want to ask of my twoaunts as well as of my eldest cousin."
"What is it?" promptly inquired madame Hsing and the rest.
"My aunts," Chia Chen replied with all haste, "you surely are aware thatyour grandson's wife is now no more; your nephew's wife is also laid upunwell, and, as I see that things in the inner apartments are really notwhat they should properly be, I would trouble my worthy eldest cousin toundertake in here the direction of affairs for a month; and if she does,my mind will be set at ease."
Madame Hsing smiled. "Is it really about this that you've come?" sheasked; "your eldest cousin is at present staying with your aunt Secunda,and all you have to do is to speak to her and it will be all right."
"How ever could a mere child like her," speedily remonstrated madameWang, "carry out all these matters? and shouldn't she manage thingsproperly, she will, on the contrary, make people laugh, so it wouldtherefore be better that you should trouble some one else."
"What your ideas are, aunt," rejoined Chia Chen smiling, "your nephewhas guessed; you're afraid lest my eldest cousin should have to bearfatigue and annoyance; for as to what you say, that she cannot managethings, why my eldest cousin has, from her youth up, ever been in herromping and playing so firm and decided; and now that she has enteredthe married estate, and has the run of affairs in that mansion, she musthave reaped so much the more experience, and have become quite an oldhand! I've been thinking these last few days that outside my eldestcousin, there's no one else who could come to my help; and, aunt, if youdon't do it for the face of your nephew and your nephew's wife, do it,at least, for the affection you bore to her who is no more."
While he uttered these words tears trickled down his face. The fearsthat madame Wang inwardly entertained were that lady Feng had noexperience in funeral matters, and she apprehended, that if she was notequal to managing them, she would incur the ridicule of others; but whenshe now heard Chia Chen make the appeal in such a disconsolate mood, sherelented considerably in her resolution. But as she turned her eyestowards lady Feng (to ascertain her wishes), she saw that she wasplunged in abstraction.
Lady Feng had all along found the greatest zest in taking the initiativein everything, with the idea of making a display of her abilities, sothat when she perceived how earnest Chia Chen was in his entreaties, shehad, at an early period, made up her mind to give a favourable reply.Seeing besides madame Wang show signs of relenting, she readily turnedround and said to her, "My elder cousin has made his appeal in such asolicitous way that your ladyship should give your consent and have donewith it."
"Do you think you are equal to the task?" inquired madame Wang in awhisper.
"What's there that I couldn't be equal to?" replied lady Feng; "forurgent matters outside, my cousin may be said to have already made fullprovision; and all there is to be done is to keep an eye over thingsinside. But should there occur anything that I don't know, I can askyou, madame, and it will be right."
Madame Wang perceiving the reasonableness of what she heard her say,uttered not a word, and when Chia Chen saw that lady Feng had assented;"How much you do attend to I don't mind," he observed, forcing anothersmile, "but I must, in any case, entreat you, cousin, to assume theonerous charge. As a first step I'll pay my obeisance to you in here,and when everything has been finished, I shall then come over into thatmansion to express my thanks."
With these words still on his lips, he made a low bow, but lady Feng hadscarcely had time to return the compliment, before Chia Chen haddirected a servant to fetch the warrant of the Ning mansion, which hebade Pao-y� hand over to lady Feng.
"Cousin," he added, "take whatever steps you think best; and if you wantanything, all you have to do is to simply send for it with this, andthere will even be no use to consult me. The only thing I must ask youis, not to be too careful in order to save me expense, for the mainconsideration is that things should be handsomely done. In the secondplace, it will be well if you were also to treat servants here in thesame way as in the other mansion, and not be too scrupulous in the fearthat any one might take offence. Outside these two concerns, there'snothing else to disturb my mind."
Lady Feng did not venture to take over the warrant at once, but merelyturned round to ascertain what were madame Wang's wishes.
"In view of the reason brother Chen advances," madame Wang rejoined,"you had better assume the charge at once and finish with it; don't,however, act on your own ideas; but when there's aught to be done, becareful and send some one to consult your cousin's wife, ever so littlethough it be on the subject."
Pao-y� had already taken over the warrant from Chia Chen's grasp, andforcibly handed it to lady Feng, "Will you, cousin," he went on toquestion, "take up your quarters here or will you come every day? shouldyou cross over, day after day, it will be ever so much more fatiguingfor you, so that I shall speedily have a separate court got ready foryou in here, where you, cousin, can put up for these several days and bemore comfortable."
"There's no need," replied lady Feng smiling; "for on that side theycan't do without me; and it will be better if I were to come daily."
"Do as you like," Chia Chen observed; and after subsequently passing afew more irrelevant remarks, he at length left the room.
After a time, the lady relatives dispersed, and madame Wang seized theopportunity to inquire of lady Feng, "What do you purpose doing to-day?"
"You had better, please madame, go back," urged lady Feng, "for I mustfirst of all find out some clue before I can go home."
Madame Wang, upon hearing these words, returned to her quarters, inadvance, in company with madame Hsing, where we will leave them.
Lady Feng meanwhile came into a colonnade, which enclosed a suite ofthree apartments, and taking a seat, she gave way to reflection. "Thefirst consideration," she communed within herself, "is that thehousehold is made up of mixed elements, and things might be lost; thesecond is that the preparations are under no particular control, withthe result that, when the time comes, the servants might shirk theirduties; the third is that the necessary expenditure being great, therewill be reckless disbursements and counterfeit receipts; the fourth,that with the absence of any distinction in the matter of duties,whether large or small, hardship and ease will be unequally shared; andthe fifth, that the servants being arrogant, through leniency, thosewith any self-respect will not brook control, while those devoid of'face' will not be able to improve their ways."
These five were, in point of fact, usages in vogue in the Ning mansion.But as you are unable, reader, to ascertain here how lady Feng setthings right, listen to the explanations given in the following chapter.

CHAPTER XIV.
  Lin Ju-hai dies in the City of Yang Chou.  Chia Pao-y� meets the Prince of Pei Ching on the way.
When Lai Sheng, be it noticed in continuing our story, the major-domo inthe Ning Kuo mansion, came to hear that from inside an invitation hadbeen extended to lady Feng to act as deputy, he summoned together hisco-workers and other servants. "Lady Secunda, of the western mansion,"he harangued them, "has now been asked to take over the control ofinternal affairs; and should she come we must, when we apply foranything, or have anything to say, be circumspect in our service; weshould all every day come early and leave late; and it's better that weshould exert ourselves during this one month and take rest after it'sover. We mustn't throw away our old 'face,' for she's well known to bean impetuous thing, with a soured face and a hard heart, who, whenangry, knows no distinction of persons."
The whole company unanimously admitted that he was right; and one oftheir number too observed smilingly, "It's but right that for the innerapartments, we should, in fact, get her to come and put things in properorder, as everything is very much what it should not be."
But while he uttered these words, they saw Lai Wang's wife coming, withan indent in hand, to fetch paper for the supplications and prayers, theamount of which was mentioned on the order; and they one and allhastened to press her into a seat, and to help her to a cup of tea;while a servant was told to fetch the quantity of paper required. (Whenit was brought,) Lai Wang carried it in his arms and came, the whole waywith his wife, as far as the ceremonial gate; when he, at length,delivered it over to her and she clasped it, and walked into the roomall alone.
Lady Feng issued prompt directions to Ts'ai Ming to prepare a register;and sending, there and then, for Lai Sheng's wife, she asked her tosubmit, for her perusal, the roll with the servants' names. Shefurthermore fixed upon an early hour of the following day to convene thedomestics and their wives in the mansion, in order that they shouldreceive their orders; but, after cursorily glancing over the number ofentries in the list, and making a few inquiries of Lai Sheng's wife, shesoon got into her curricle, and went home.
On the next day, at six and two quarters, she speedily came over. Thematrons and married women of the Ning Kuo mansion assembled together, assoon as they heard of her arrival; but, perceiving lady Feng, assistedby Lai Sheng's wife, engaged in apportioning the duties of each servant,they could not presume to intrude, but remained outside the windowlistening to what was going on.
"As I've been asked to take over the charge," they heard lady Fengexplain to Lai Sheng's wife, "I'm, needless to say, sure to incur thedispleasure of you all, for I can't compare with your mistress, who hassuch a sweet temper, and allows you to have your own way. But sayingnothing more of those ways, which prevailed hitherto among your peoplein this mansion, you must now do as I tell you; for on the slightestdisregard of my orders, I shall, with no discrimination between thosewho may be respectable and those who may not be, clearly and distinctlycall all alike to account."
Having concluded these remarks, she went on to order Ts'ai Ming to readthe roll; and, as their names were uttered, one by one was called in,and passed under inspection. After this inspection, which was got overin a short time, she continued giving further directions. "Thesetwenty," she said "should be divided into two companies; ten in eachcompany, whose sole daily duties should be to attend inside to theguests, coming and going, and to serve tea for them; while with anyother matters, they needn't have anything to do. These other twentyshould also be divided into two companies, whose exclusive duties willbe, day after day, to look after the tea and eatables of the relativesof our family; and these too will have no business to concern themselveswith outside matters. These forty will again be divided into twocompanies, who will have nothing else to look to than to remain in frontof the coffin and offer incense, renew the oil, hang up the streamers,watch the coffin, offer sacrifices of rice, and oblations of tea, andmourn with the mourners; and neither need they mind anything outsidethese duties. These four servants will be specially attached to theinner tea-rooms to look after cups, saucers and the tea articlesgenerally; and in the event of the loss of any single thing, the four ofthem will have to make it good between them. These other four servantswill have the sole charge of the articles required for eatables andwine; and should any get mislaid compensation will have likewise to bemade by them. These eight servants will only have to attend to takingover the sacrificial offerings; while these eight will have nothing moreto see to beyond keeping an eye over the lamps, oil, candles and paperwanted everywhere. I'll have a whole supply served out and handed to youeight to by and by apportion to the various places, in quantities whichI will determine. These thirty servants are each day, by rotation, tokeep watch everywhere during the night, looking after the gates andwindows, taking care of the fires and candles, and sweeping the grounds;while the servants, who remain, are to be divided for duty in the housesand rooms, each one having charge of a particular spot. And beginningfrom the tables, chairs and curios in each place, up to the verycuspidors and brooms, yea even to each blade of grass or sprout of herb,which may be there, the servants looking after this part will be calledupon to make good anything that may be either mislaid or damaged. You,Lai Sheng's wife, will every day have to exercise general supervisionand inspection; and should there be those who be lazy, any who maygamble, drink, fight or wrangle, come at once and report the matter tome; and you mustn't show any leniency, for if I come to find it out, Ishall have no regard to the good old name of three or four generations,which you may enjoy. You now all have your fixed duties, so thatwhatever batch of you after this acts contrary to these orders, I shallsimply have something to say to that batch and to no one else. Theservants, who have all along been in my service, carry watches on theirpersons, and things, whether large or small, are invariably done at afixed time. But, in any case, you also have clocks in your master'srooms, so that at 6.30, I shall come and read the roll, and at tenyou'll have breakfast. Whenever there is any indent of any permits to bemade or any report to be submitted, it should be done at 11.30 a.m. andno later. At 7 p.m., after the evening paper has been burnt, I shallcome to each place in person to hold an inspection; and on my return,the servants on watch for the night will hand over the keys. The nextday, I shall again come over at 6.30 in the morning; and needless to saywe must all do the best we can for these few days; and when the work hasbeen finished your master is sure to recompense you."
When she had done speaking, she went on to give orders that tea, oil,candles, feather dusters, brooms and other necessaries should be issued,according to the fixed quantities. She also had furniture, such astable-covers, antimacassars, cushions, rugs, cuspidors, stools and thelike brought over and distributed; while, at the same time, she took upthe pencil and made a note of the names of the persons in charge of thevarious departments, and of the articles taken over by the respectiveservants, in entries remarkable for the utmost perspicacity.
The whole body of servants received their charge and left; but they allhad work to go and attend to; not as in former times, when they were atliberty to select for themselves what was convenient to do, while thearduous work, which remained over, no one could be found to take inhand. Neither was it possible for them in the various establishments toany longer avail themselves of the confusion to carelessly mislaythings. In fact, visitors came and guests left, but everything after allwent off quietly, unlike the disorderly way which prevailed hitherto,when there was no clue to the ravel; and all such abuses as indolence,and losses, and the like were completely eradicated.
Lady Feng, on her part, (perceiving) the weight her influence had inenjoining the observance of her directions, was in her heart exceedinglydelighted. But as she saw, that Chia Chen was, in consequence of Mrs.Yu's indisposition, even so much the more grieved as to take very littleto drink or to eat, she daily, with her own hands, prepared, in theother mansion, every kind of fine congee and luscious small dishes,which she sent over, in order that he might be tempted to eat.
And Chia Lien had likewise given additional directions that every daythe finest delicacies should be taken into the ante-chamber, for theexclusive use of lady Feng.
Lady Feng was not one to shirk exertion and fatigue, so that, day afterday, she came over at the proper time, called the roll, and managedbusiness, sitting all alone in the ante-chamber, and not congregatingwith the whole bevy of sisters-in-law. Indeed, even when relatives orvisitors came or went, she did not go to receive them, or see them off.
This day was the thirty-fifth day, the very day of the fifth seven, andthe whole company of bonzes had just (commenced the services) forunclosing the earth, and breaking Hell open; for sending a light to showthe way to the departed spirit; for its being admitted to an audience bythe king of Hell; for arresting all the malicious devils, as well as forsoliciting the soul-saving Buddha to open the golden bridge and to leadthe way with streamers. The Taoist priests were engaged in reverentlyreading the prayers; in worshipping the Three Pure Ones and inprostrating themselves before the Gemmy Lord. The disciples ofabstraction were burning incense, in order to release the hungeredspirits, and were reading the water regrets manual. There was also acompany of twelve nuns of tender years, got up in embroidered dresses,and wearing red shoes, who stood before the coffin, silently reading allthe incantations for the reception of the spirit (from the lowerregions,) with the result that the utmost bustle and stir prevailed.
Lady Feng, well aware that not a few guests would call on this day, wasquick to get out of bed at four sharp, to dress her hair and perform herablutions. After having completed every arrangement for the day, shechanged her costume, washed her hands, and swallowed a couple ofmouthfuls of milk. By the time she had rinsed her mouth, it was exactly6.30; and Lai Wang's wife, at the head of a company of servants, hadbeen waiting a good long while, when lady Feng appeared in front of theEntrance Hall, mounted her carriage and betook herself, preceded by apair of transparent horn lanterns, on which were written, in large type,the three characters, Jung Kuo mansion, to the main entrance gate of theNing Household. The door lanterns shed brilliant rays from where theywere suspended; while on either side the lanterns, of uniform colours,propped upright, emitted a lustrous light as bright as day.
The servants of the family, got up in their mourning clothes, coveredthe ground far and wide like a white sheet. They stood drawn in tworows, and requested that the carriage should drive up to the mainentrance. The youths retired, and all the married women came forward,and raising the curtain of the carriage, lady Feng alighted; and as withone arm she supported herself on Feng Erh, two married women, withlanterns in their hands, lighted the way. Pressed round by the servants,lady Feng made her entry. The married women of the Ning mansion advancedto greet her, and to pay their respects; and this over, lady Feng, withgraceful bearing, entered the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.Ascending the Spirit Hall, where the tablet was laid, the tears, as soonas she caught sight of the coffin, trickled down her eyes like pearlswhose string had snapped; while the youths in the court, and theirnumber was not small, stood in a reverent posture, with their armsagainst their sides, waiting to burn the paper. Lady Feng uttered oneremark, by way of command: "Offer the tea and burn the paper!" when thesound of two blows on the gong was heard and the whole band struck uptogether. A servant had at an early period placed a large armchair infront of the tablet, and lady Feng sat down, and gave way to loudlamentations. Promptly all those, who stood inside or outside, whetherhigh or low, male or female, took up the note, and kept on wailing andweeping until Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu, after a time, sent a message toadvise her to withhold her tears; when at length lady Feng desisted.
Lai Wang's wife served the tea; and when she had finished rinsing hermouth, lady Feng got up; and, taking leave of all the members of theclan, she walked all alone into the ante-chamber, where she ascertained,in the order of their names, the number of the servants of everydenomination in there. They were all found to be present, with theexception of one, who had failed to appear, whose duties consisted inreceiving and escorting the relatives and visitors. Orders were promptlygiven to summon him, and the man appeared in a dreadful fright. "What!"exclaimed lady Feng, as she forced a smile, "is it you who have beenremiss? Is it because you're more respectable than they that you don'tchoose to listen to my words?"
"Your servant," he pleaded, "has come at an early hour every day; andit's only to-day that I come late by one step; and I entreat yourladyship to forgive this my first offence."
While yet he spoke, she perceived the wife of Wang Hsing, of the JungKuo mansion, come forward and pop her head in to see what was going on;but lady Feng did not let this man go, but went on to inquire of WangHsing's wife what she had come for.
Wang Hsing's wife drew near. "I've come," she explained, "to get anorder, so as to obtain some thread to make tassels for the carriages andchairs." Saying this, she produced the permit and handed it up,whereupon lady Feng directed Ts'ai Ming to read the contents aloud. "Fortwo large, sedan chairs," he said, "four small sedan chairs and fourcarriages, are needed in all so many large and small tassels, eachtassel requiring so many catties of beads and thread."
Lady Feng finding, after she had heard what was read, that the numbers(and quantities) corresponded, forthwith bade Ts'ai Ming make the properentry; and when the order from the Jung Kuo mansion had been fetched,and thrown at her, Wang Hsing's wife took her departure.
Lady Feng was on the very point of saying something, when she espiedfour managers of the Jung Kuo mansion walk in; all of whom wantedpermits to indent for stores. Having asked them to read out the list ofwhat they required, she ascertained that they wanted four kinds ofarticles in all. Drawing attention to two items: "These entries," sheremarked, "are wrong; and you had better go again and make out theaccount clearly, and then come and fetch a permit."
With these words, she flung down the requisitions, and the two men wenttheir way in lower spirits than when they had come.
Lady Feng then caught sight of the wife of Chang Ts'ai standing by, andasked her what was her business, whereupon Chang Ts'ai's wife promptlyproduced an indent. "The covers of the carriages and sedan chairs," shereported, "have just been completed, and I've come to fetch the amountdue to the tailors for wages."
Lady Feng, upon hearing her explanation, took over the indent, anddirected Ts'ai Ming to enter the items in the book. After Wang Hsing hadhanded over the money, and obtained the receipt of the accountant, dulysigned, which tallied with the payment, he subsequently walked away incompany with Chang Ts'ai's wife. Lady Feng simultaneously proceeded togive orders that another indent should be read, which was for money topurchase paper with to paste on the windows of Pao-y�'s outerschool-room, the repairs to which had been brought to completion, and assoon as lady Feng heard the nature of the application, she there andthen gave directions that the permit should be taken over and an entrymade, and that the money should be issued after Chang Ts'ai's wife haddelivered everything clearly.
"If to-morrow he were to come late," lady Feng then remarked, "and ifthe day after, I were to come late; why by and by there'll be no onehere at all! I should have liked to have let you off, but if I belenient with you on this first instance, it will be hard for me, on theoccurrence of another offence, to exercise any control over the rest.It's much better therefore that I should settle accounts with you."
The moment she uttered these words, she put on a serious look, and gaveorders that he should be taken out and administered twenty blows withthe bamboo. When the servants perceived that lady Feng was in an angrymood, they did not venture to dilly-dally, but dragged him out, and gavehim the full number of blows; which done, they came in to report thatthe punishment had been inflicted.
Lady Feng likewise threw down the Ning Mansion order and exclaimed,addressing herself to Lai Sheng: "Cut him a month's wages and rice! andtell them all to disperse, and have done with it!"
All the servants at length withdrew to attend to their respectiveduties, while the man too, who had been flogged, walked away, as he didall he could to conceal his shame and stifle his tears. About this timearrived and went, in an incessant stream, servants from both the Jungand Ning mansions, bent upon applying for permits and returning permits,and with one by one again did lady Feng settle accounts. And, as in duecourse, the inmates of the Ning mansion came to know how terrible ladyFeng was, each and all were ever since so wary and dutiful that they didnot venture to be lazy.
But without going into further details on this subject, we shall nowreturn to Pao-y�. Seeing that there were a lot of people about andfearing lest Ch'in Chung might receive some offence, he lost no time incoming along with him to sit over at lady Feng's. Lady Feng was justhaving her repast, and upon seeing them arrive: "Your legs are longenough, and couldn't you have come somewhat quicker!" she laughinglyobserved.
"We've had our rice, thanks," replied Pao-y�.
"Have you had it," inquired lady Feng, "outside here, or over on theother side?"
"Would we eat anything with all that riff-raff?" exclaimed Pao-y�;"we've really had it over there; in fact, I now come after having hadmine with dowager lady Chia."
As he uttered these words, they took their seats. Lady Feng had justfinished her meal, when a married woman from the Ning mansion came toget an order to obtain an advance of money to purchase incense andlanterns with.
"I calculated," observed lady Feng, "that you would come to-day to makerequisition, but I was under the impression that you had forgotten; hadyou really done so you would certainly have had to get them on your ownaccount, and I would have been the one to benefit."
"Didn't I forget? I did," rejoined the married woman as she smiled; "andit's only a few minutes back that it came to my mind; had I been onesecond later I wouldn't have been in time to get the things."
These words ended, she took over the order and went off. Entries had, atthe time to be made in the books, and orders to be issued, and Ch'inChung was induced to interpose with a smirk, "In both these mansions ofyours, such orders are alike in use; but were any outsider stealthily tocounterfeit one and to abscond, after getting the money, what could everbe done?"
"In what you say," replied lady Feng, "you take no account of the lawsof the land."
"How is it that from our house, no one comes to get any orders or toobtain anything?" Pao-y� having inquired: "At the time they come tofetch them," rejoined lady Feng, "you're still dreaming; but let me askyou one thing, when will you two at last begin your evening course ofstudies?"
"Oh, I wish we were able to begin our studies this very day," Pao-y�added; "that would be the best thing, but they're very slow in puttingthe school-room in order, so that there's no help for it!"
Lady Feng laughed. "Had you asked me," she remarked, "I can assure youit would have been ready quick enough."
"You too would have been of no use," observed Pao-y�, "for it willcertainly be ready by the time they ought to finish it in."
"But in order that they should do the work," suggested lady Feng, "it'salso necessary that they should have the material, they can't do withoutthem; and if I don't give them any permits, it will be difficult toobtain them."
Pao-y� at these words readily drew near to lady Feng, and there and thenapplied for the permits. "My dear sister," he added, "do give them thepermits to enable them to obtain the material and effect the repairs."
"I feel quite sore from fatigue," ventured lady Feng, "and how can Istand your rubbing against me? but compose your mind. They have thisvery day got the paper, and gone to paste it; and would they, forwhatever they need, have still waited until they had been sent for? theyare not such fools after all!"
Pao-y� would not believe it, and lady Feng at once called Ts'ai Ming tolook up the list, which she handed for Pao-y�'s inspection; but whilethey were arguing a servant came in to announce that Chao Erh, who hadgone to Su Chow, had returned, and lady Feng all in a flurry directedthat he should be asked to walk in. Chao Erh bent one knee and paid hisobeisance.
"Why have you come back?" lady Feng readily inquired.
"Mr. Secundus (Chia Lien)," he reported, "sent me back to tell you thatMr. Lin (our dowager lady's) son-in-law, died on the third of the ninthmoon; that Master Secundus is taking Miss Lin along with him to escortthe coffin of Mr. Lin as far as Su Chow; and that they hope to be backsome time about the end of the year. Master despatched me to come andannounce the news, to bring his compliments, and to crave our old lady'sinstructions as well as to see how you are getting on in my lady's home.He also bade me take back to him a few long fur pelisses."
"Have you seen any one else besides me?" lady Feng inquired.
"I've seen every one," rejoined Chao Erh; and withdrew hastily at theconclusion of this remark, out of the apartment, while lady Feng turnedtowards Pao-y� with a smile and said, "Your cousin Lin can now live inour house for ever."
"Poor thing!" exclaimed Pao-y�. "I presume that during all these daysshe has wept who knows how much;" and saying this he wrinkled his browand heaved a deep sigh.
Lady Feng saw Chao Erh on his return, but as she could not very well, inthe presence of third persons, make minute inquiries after Chia Lien,she had to continue a prey to inward solicitude till it was time to gohome, for, not having got through what she had to do, she was compelledto wait patiently until she went back in the evening, when she againsent word for Chao Erh to come in, and asked him with all minutenesswhether the journey had been pleasant throughout, and for fullparticulars. That very night, she got in readiness the long pelisses,which she herself, with the assistance of P'ing Erh, packed up in abundle; and after careful thought as to what things he would require,she put them in the same bundle and committed them to Chao Erh's care.She went on to solicitously impress upon Chao Erh to be careful in hisattendance abroad. "Don't provoke your master to wrath," she said, "andfrom time to time do advise him not to drink too much wine; and don'tentice him to make the acquaintance of any low people; for if you do,when you come back I will cut your leg off."
The preparations were hurriedly and confusedly completed; and it wasalready the fourth watch of the night when she went to sleep. But soonagain the day dawned, and after hastily performing her toilette andablutions, she came over to the Ning Mansion.
As Chia Chen realised that the day for escorting the body away wasdrawing nigh, he in person went out in a curricle, along withgeomancers, to the Temple of the Iron Fence to inspect a suitable placefor depositing the coffin. He also, point by point, enjoined theresident managing-bonze, Se K'ung, to mind and get ready brand-newarticles of decoration and furniture, and to invite a considerablenumber of bonzes of note to be at hand to lend their services for thereception of the coffin.
Se K'ung lost no time in getting ready the evening meal, but Chia Chenhad, in fact, no wish for any tea or rice; and, as the day was faradvanced and he was not in time to enter the city, he had, after all, torest during that night as best he could in a "chaste" room in thetemple. The next morning, as soon as it was day, he hastened to comeinto the city and to make every preparation for the funeral. He likewisedeputed messengers to proceed ahead to the Temple of the Iron Fence togive, that very night, additional decorative touches to the place wherethe coffin was to be deposited, and to get ready tea and all the othernecessaries, for the use of the persons who would be present at thereception of the coffin.
Lady Feng, seeing that the day was not far distant, also apportionedduties and made provision for everything beforehand with circumspectcare; while at the same time she chose in the Jung mansion, suchcarriages, sedan chairs and retinue as were to accompany the cortege, inattendance upon madame Wang, and gave her mind furthermore to finding aplace where she herself could put up in at the time of the funeral.About this very time, it happened that the consort of the Duke Shan Kuodeparted this life, and that mesdames Wang and Hsing had likewise to goand offer sacrifices, and to follow the burial procession; that thebirthday occurred of the consort of Prince Hsi An; that presents had tobe forwarded on the occasion of this anniversary; and that the consortof the Duke of Chen Kuo gave birth to a first child, a son, andcongratulatory gifts had, in like manner, to be provided. Besides, heruterine brother Wang Jen was about to return south, with all his family,and she had too to write her home letters, to send her reverentcompliments to her father and mother, as well as to get the things readythat were to be taken along. There was also Ying Ch'un, who hadcontracted some illness, and the doctor had every day to be sent for,and medicines to be administered, the notes of the doctor to be lookedafter, consisting of the bulletins of the diagnosis and theprescriptions, with the result that the various things that had to beattended to by lady Feng were so manifold that it would, indeed, bedifficult to give an exhaustive idea of them.
In addition to all this, the day for taking the coffin away was close athand, so that lady Feng was so hard pressed for time that she had evenno desire for any tea to drink or anything to eat, and that she couldnot sit or rest in peace. As soon as she put her foot into the Ningmansion, the inmates of the Jung mansion would follow close upon herheels; and the moment she got back into the Jung mansion, the servantsagain of the Ning mansion would follow her about. In spite however ofthis great pressure, lady Feng, whose natural disposition had ever beento try and excel, was urged to strain the least of her energies, as hersole dread was lest she should incur unfavourable criticism from anyone; and so excellent were the plans she devised, that every one in theclan, whether high or low, readily conceded her unlimited praise.
On the night of this day, the body had to be watched, and in the innersuite of apartments two companies of young players as well as jugglersentertained the relatives, friends and other visitors during the wholeof the night. Mrs. Yu was still laid up in the inside room, so that thewhole task of attending to and entertaining the company devolved uponlady Feng alone, who had to look after everything; for though therewere, in the whole clan, many sisters-in-law, some there were toobashful to speak, others too timid to stand on their feet; while therewere also those who were not accustomed to meeting company; and thoselikewise who were afraid of people of high estate and shy of officials.Of every kind there were, but the whole number of them could not come upto lady Feng's standard, whose deportment was correct and whose speechwas according to rule. Hence it was that she did not even so much asheed any of that large company, but gave directions and issued orders,adopting any course of action which she fancied, just as if there wereno bystander.
The whole night, the lanterns emitted a bright light and the firesbrilliant rays; while guests were escorted on their way out andofficials greeted on their way in; but of this hundredfold bustle andstir nothing need, of course, be said.
The next morning at the dawn of day, and at a propitious moment,sixty-four persons, dressed all alike in blue, carried the coffin,preceded by a streamer with the record in large characters: Coffin oflady Ch'in, a lady of the fifth degree, (by marriage) of the Chiamansion, deceased at middle age, consort of the grandson of the Ning KuoDuke with the first rank title of honour, (whose status is) a guard ofthe Imperial antechamber, charged with the protection of the InnerPalace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City.
The various paraphernalia and ornaments were all brand-new, hurriedlymade for the present occasion, and the uniform lustrous brilliancy theyshed was sufficient to dazzle the eyes.
Pao-chu, of course, observed the rites prescribed for unmarrieddaughters, and dashed the bowl and walked by the coffin, as she gave wayto most bitter lamentations.
At that time, among the officials who escorted the funeral procession,were Niu Chi-tsung, the grandson of the Chen Kuo duke, who had nowinherited the status of earl of the first degree; Liu Fang, the grandsonof Liu Piao, duke of Li Kuo, who had recently inherited the rank ofviscount of the first class; Ch'en Jui-wen, a grandson of Ch'en Yi, dukeof Ch'i Kuo, who held the hereditary rank of general of the thirddegree, with the prefix of majestic authority; Ma Shang, the grandson ofMa K'uei, duke of Chih Kuo, by inheritance general of the third rankwith the prefix of majesty afar; Hou Hsiao-keng, an hereditary viscountof the first degree, grandson of the duke of Hsiu Kuo, Hou Hsiao-ming byname; while the death of the consort of the duke of Shan Kuo had obligedhis grandson Shih Kuang-chu to go into mourning so that he could not bepresent. These were the six families which had, along with the twohouseholds of Jung and Ning, been, at one time, designated the eightdukes.
Among the rest, there were besides the grandson of the Prince of Nan An;the grandson of the Prince of Hsi An; Shih Ting, marquis of Chung Ching;Chiang Tzu-ning, an hereditary baron of the second grade, grandson ofthe earl of P'ing Yuan; Hsieh K'un, an hereditary baron of the secondorder and Captain of the Metropolitan camp, grandson of the marquis ofTing Ch'ang: Hsi Chien-hui, an hereditary baron of the second rank, agrandson of the marquis of Nang Yang; Ch'in Liang, in command of theFive Cities, grandson of the marquis of Ching T'ien. The remainder wereWei Chi, the son of the earl of Chin Hsiang; Feng Tzu-ying, the son of ageneral, whose prefix was supernatural martial spirit; Ch'en Yeh-ch�n,Wei Jo-lan and others, grandsons and sons of princes who could not beenumerated.
In the way of ladies, there were also in all about ten large officialsedan chairs full of them, thirty or forty private chairs, and includingthe official and non-official chairs, and carriages containing inmatesof the household, there must have been over a hundred and ten; so thatwith the various kinds of paraphernalia, articles of decoration andhundreds of nick-nacks, which preceded, the vast expanse of the cortegecovered a continuous line extending over three or four li.
They had not been very long on their way, when they reached variegatedsheds soaring high by the roadside, in which banquets were spread,feasts laid out, and music discoursed in unison. These were the viatorysacrificial offerings contributed by the respective families. The firstshed contained the sacrificial donations of the mansion of the Prince ofTung P'ing; the second shed those of the Prince of Nan An; the thirdthose of the Prince of Hsi Ning, and the fourth those of the Prince ofPei Ching.
Indeed of these four Princes, the reputation enjoyed in former days bythe Prince of Pei Ching had been the most exalted, and to this day hissons and grandsons still succeeded to the inheritance of the princelydignity. The present incumbent of the Princedom of Pei Ching, Shih Jung,had not as yet come of age, but he was gifted with a presence ofexceptional beauty, and with a disposition condescending and genial. Atthe demise, recently, of the consort of the eldest grandson of themansion of Ning Kuo, he, in consideration of the friendship which hadformerly existed between the two grandfathers, by virtue of which theyhad been inseparable, both in adversity as well as in prosperity,treating each other as if they had not been of different surnames, wasconsequently induced to pay no regard to princely dignity or to hisimportance, but having like the others paid, on the previous day, hiscondolences and presented sacrificial offerings, he had further nowraised a shed wherein to offer libations. Having directed every one ofhis subordinate officers to remain in this spot in attendance, hehimself went at the fifth watch to court, and when he acquitted himselfof his public duties he forthwith changed his attire for a mourningcostume, and came along, in an official sedan chair, preceded by gongsand umbrellas. Upon reaching the front of the shed the chair wasdeposited on the ground, and as his subordinate officers pressed oneither side and waited upon him, neither the military nor the populace,which composed the mass of people, ventured to make any commotion. In ashort while, the long procession of the Ning mansion became visible,spreading far and wide, covering in its course from the north, the wholeground like a silver mountain. At an early hour, the forerunners,messengers and other attendants on the staff of the Ning mansionapprised Chia Chen (of the presence of the sheds), and Chia Chen withall alacrity gave orders that the foremost part of the cortege shouldhalt. Attended by Chia She and Chia Chen, the three of them came withhurried step to greet (the Prince of Pei Ching), whom they saluted withdue ceremony. Shih Jung, who was seated in his sedan chair, made a bowand returned their salutations with a smile, proceeding to address themand to treat them, as he had done hitherto, as old friends, without anyairs of self-importance.
"My daughter's funeral has," observed Chia Chen, "put your Highness tothe trouble of coming, an honour which we, though noble by birth, do notdeserve."
Shih Jung smiled. "With the terms of friendship," he added, "which haveexisted for so many generations (between our families), is there anyneed for such apologies?"
Turning his head round there and then, he gave directions to the seniorofficer of his household to preside at the sacrifices and to offerlibations in his stead; and Chia She and the others stood together onone side and made obeisance in return, and then came in person again andgave expression to their gratitude for his bounty.
Shih Jung was most affable and complaisant. "Which is the gentleman," heinquired of Chia Chen, "who was born with a piece of jade in his mouth?I've long had a wish to have the pleasure of seeing him, and as he'ssure to be on the spot on an occasion like this, why shouldn't youinvite him to come round?"
Chia Chen speedily drew back, and bidding Pao-y� change his mourningclothes, he led him forward and presented him.
Pao-y� had all along heard that Shih Jung was a worthy Prince, perfectin ability as well as in appearance, pleasant and courteous, not bounddown by any official custom or state rite, so that he had repeatedlyfelt a keen desire to meet him. With the sharp control, however, whichhis father exercised over him, he had not been able to gratify his wish.But on this occasion, he saw on the contrary that he came to call him,and it was but natural that he should be delighted. Whilst advancing, hescrutinised Shih Jung with the corner of his eye, who, seated as he wasin the sedan chair, presented an imposing sight.
But, reader, what occurred on his approach is not yet known, but listento the next chapter, which will divulge it.

CHAPTER XV.
  Lady Peng, n�e Wang, exercises her authority in the Iron Fence Temple.  Ch'in Ching-ch'ing (Ch'ing Chung) amuses himself in the Man-t'ou      (Bread) nunnery.
But we shall now resume our story. When Pao-y� raised his eyes, henoticed that Shih Jung, Prince of Pei Ching, wore on his head a princelycap with pure white tassels and silvery feathers, that he was appareledin a white ceremonial robe, (with a pattern representing) the toothlikeripple of a river and the waters of the sea, embroidered withfive-clawed dragons; and that he was girded with a red leather belt,inlaid with white jade. That his face was like a beauteous gem; that hiseyes were like sparkling stars; and that he was, in very truth, a humanbeing full of graceful charms.
Pao-y� hastily pressed forward and made a reverent obeisance, and ShihJung lost no time in extending his arms from inside the sedan-chair, andembracing him. At a glance, he saw that Pao-y� had on his head a silvercap, to which the hair was attached, that he had, round his forehead, aflap on which were embroidered a couple of dragons issuing from the sea,that he wore a white archery-sleeved robe, ornamented with dragons, andthat his waist was encircled by a silver belt, inlaid with pearls; thathis face resembled vernal flowers and that his eyes were like drops oflacquer.
Shih Jung smiled. "Your name is," he said, "no trumped-up story; foryou, verily, resemble a precious gem; but where's the valuable trinketyou had in your mouth?" he inquired.
As soon as Pao-y� heard this inquiry, he hastened to produce the jadefrom inside his clothes and to hand it over to Shih Jung. Shih Jungminutely examined it; and having also read the motto on it, heconsequently ascertained whether it was really efficacious or not.
"It's true that it's said to be," Pao-y� promptly explained, "but ithasn't yet been put to the test."
Shih Jung extolled it with unbounded praise, and, as he did so, he setthe variegated tassels in proper order, and, with his own hands,attached it on to Pao-y�'s neck. Taking also his hand in his, heinquired of Pao-y� what was his age? and what books he was reading atpresent, to each of which questions Pao-y� gave suitable answer.
Shih Jung perceiving the perspicacity of his speech and the propriety ofhis utterances, simultaneously turned towards Chia Chen and observedwith a smile on his face: "Your worthy son is, in very truth, like theyoung of a dragon or like the nestling of a phoenix! and this isn't anidle compliment which I, a despicable prince, utter in your venerablepresence! But how much more glorious will be, in the future, the voiceof the young phoenix than that of the old phoenix, it isn't easy toascertain."
Chia Chen forced a smile: "My cur-like son," he replied, "cannot presumeto such bountiful praise and golden commendation; but if, by the virtueof your Highness' excess of happiness, he does indeed realise yourwords, he will be a source of joy to us all!"
"There's one thing, however," continued Shih Jung; "with the excellentabilities which your worthy scion possesses, he's sure, I presume, to beextremely loved by her dowager ladyship, (his grandmother), and by allclasses. But for young men of our age it's a great drawback to be doatedupon, for with over-fondness, we cannot help utterly frustrating thebenefits of education. When I, a despicable prince, was young, I walkedin this very track, and I presume that your honourable son cannotlikewise but do the same. By remaining at home, your worthy scion willfind it difficult to devote his attention to study; and he will not reapany harm, were he to come, at frequent intervals, to my humble home; forthough my deserts be small, I nevertheless enjoy the great honour of theacquaintance of all the scholars of note in the Empire, so that,whenever any of them visit the capital, not one of them is there whodoes not lower his blue eyes upon me. Hence it is that in my mean abode,eminent worthies rendezvous; and were your esteemed son to come, asoften as he can, and converse with them and meet them, his knowledgewould, in that case, have every opportunity of making daily stridestowards improvement."
Chia Chen speedily bent his body and expressed his acquiescence, by wayof reply; whereupon Shih Jung went further, and taking off from hiswrist a chaplet of pearls, he presented it to Pao-y�.
"This is the first time we meet," he observed. "Our meeting was sounexpected that I have no suitable congratulatory present to offer you.This was conferred upon me by His Majesty, and is a string ofchaplet-pearls, scented with Ling Ling, which will serve as a temporarytoken of respectful congratulations."
Pao-y� hastened to receive it from his hands, and turning round, hereverently presented it to Chia Chen. Chia Chen and Pao-y� jointlyreturned thanks; and forthwith Chia She, Chia Chen and the rest cameforward in a body, and requested the Prince to turn his chair homewards.
"The departed," expostulated Shih Jung, "has already ascended thespiritual regions, and is no more a mortal being in this dusty worldexposed to vicissitude like you and I. Although a mean prince like mehas been the recipient of the favour of the Emperor, and hasundeservedly been called to the princely inheritance, how could Ipresume to go before the spiritual hearse and return home?"
Chia She and the others, perceiving how persistent he was in his refusalhad no course but to take their leave, express their sense of gratitudeand to rejoin the cortege. They issued orders to their servants to stopthe band, and to hush the music, and making the procession go by, theyat length left the way clear for Shih Jung to prosecute his way.
But we will now leave him and resume our account of the funeral of theNing mansion. All along its course the road was plunged in unusualcommotion. As soon as they reached the city gates Chia She, Chia Cheng,Chia Chen, and the others again received donations from all their fellowofficers and subordinates, in sacrificial sheds erected by theirrespective families, and after they returned thanks to one afteranother, they eventually issued from the city walls, and proceededeventually along the highway, in the direction of the Temple of the IronFence.
Chia Chen, at this time, went, together with Chia Jung, up to all theirseniors, and pressed them to get into their sedan chairs, and to ridetheir horses; and Chia She and all of the same age as himself wereconsequently induced to mount into their respective carriages or chairs.Chia Chen and those of the same generation were likewise about to ridetheir horses, when lady Feng, through her solicitude on Pao-y�'saccount, gave way to fears lest now that they had reached the opencountry, he should do as he pleased, and not listen to the words of anyof the household, and lest Chia Chen should not be able to keep him incheck; and, as she dreaded that he might go astray, she felt compelledto bid a youth call him to her; and Pao-y� had no help but to appearbefore her curricle.
"My dear brother," lady Feng remarked smiling, "you are a respectableperson, and like a girl in your ways, and shouldn't imitate thosemonkeys on horseback! do get down and let both you and I sit together inthis carriage; and won't that be nice?"
At these words, Pao-y� readily dismounted and climbed up into thecarriage occupied by lady Feng; and they both talked and laughed, asthey continued their way.
But not a long time elapsed before two men, on horseback, were seenapproaching from the opposite direction. Coming straight up to ladyFeng's vehicle they dismounted, and said, as they leaned on the sides ofher carriage, "There's a halting place here, and will it not please yourladyship to have a rest and change?"
Lady Feng directed them to ask the two ladies Hsing and Wang what theywould like to do, and the two men explained: "These ladies havesignified that they had no desire to rest, and they wish your ladyshipto suit your convenience."
Lady Feng speedily issued orders that they should have a rest, beforethey prosecuted their way, and the servant youth led the harnessedhorses through the crowd of people and came towards the north, whilePao-y�, from inside the carriage, urgently asked that Mr. Ch'in shouldbe requested to come.
Ch'in Chung was at this moment on horseback following in the track ofhis father's carriage, when unexpectedly he caught sight of Pao-y�'spage, come at a running pace and invite him to have some refreshment.Ch'in Chung perceived from a distance that the horse, which Pao-y� hadbeen riding, walked behind lady Feng's vehicle, as it went towards thenorth, with its saddle and bridles all piled up, and readily concludingthat Pao-y� must be in the same carriage with that lady, he too turnedhis horse and came over in haste and entered, in their company, the doorof a farm-house.
This dwelling of the farmer's did not contain many rooms so that thewomen and girls had nowhere to get out of the way; and when the villagelasses and country women perceived the bearing and costumes of ladyFeng, Pao-y�, and Ch'in Chung, they were inclined to suspect thatcelestial beings had descended into the world.
Lady Feng entered a thatched house, and, in the first place, askedPao-y� and the rest to go out and play. Pao-y� took the hint, and, alongwith Ch'in Chung, he led off the servant boys and went to romp all overthe place.
The various articles in use among the farmers they had not seen before,with the result that after Pao-y� had inspected them, he thought themall very strange; but he could neither make out their names nor theiruses. But among the servant boys, there were those who knew, and theyexplained to them, one after another, what they were called, as well aswhat they were for. As Pao-y�, after this explanation, nodded his head;"It isn't strange," he said, "that an old writer has this line in hispoetical works, 'Who can realise that the food in a bowl is, grain bygrain, all the fruit of labour.' This is indeed so!" As he spoke, theyhad come into another house; and at the sight of a spinning wheel on astove-bed, they thought it still more strange and wonderful, but theservant boys again told them that it was used for spinning the yarn toweave cloth with, and Pao-y� speedily jumping on to the stove-bed, setto work turning the wheel for the sake of fun, when a village lass ofabout seventeen or eighteen years of age came forward, and asked themnot to meddle with it and spoil it.
The servant boys promptly stopped her interference; but Pao-y� himselfdesisted, as he added: "It's because I hadn't seen one before that Icame to try it for fun."
"You people can't do it," rejoined the lass, "let me turn it for you tosee."
Ch'in Chung secretly pulled Pao-y� and remarked, "It's great fun in thisvillage!" but Pao-y� gave him a nudge and observed, "If you talknonsense again, I'll beat you." Watching intently, as he uttered thesewords, the village girl who started reeling the thread, and presented,in very truth, a pretty sight. But suddenly an old woman from the otherside gave a shout. "My girl Secunda, come over at once;" and the lassdiscarded the spinning-wheel and hastily went on her way.
Pao-y� was the while feeling disappointed and unhappy, when he espied aservant, whom lady Feng had sent, come and call them both in. Lady Fenghad washed her hands and changed her costume; and asked him whether hewould change or not, and Pao-y�, having replied "No! it doesn't matterafter all if I don't change," the female attendants served tea, cakesand fruits and also poured the scented tea. Lady Feng and the othersdrank their tea, and waiting until they had put the various articles by,and made all the preparations, they promptly started to get into theircarriages. Outside, Wang Erh had got ready tips and gave them to thepeople of the farm, and the farm women and all the inmates went up tothem to express their gratitude; but when Pao-y� came to look carefully,he failed to see anything of the lass who had reeled the thread. Butthey had not gone far before they caught sight of this girl Secundacoming along with a small child in her arms, who, they concluded, washer young brother, laughing and chatting, in company with a few younggirls.
Pao-y� could not suppress the voice of love, but being seated in thecarriage, he was compelled to satisfy himself by following her with hiseyes. Soon however the vehicle sped on as rapidly as a cloud impelled bythe wind, so that when he turned his head round, there was already novestige to be seen of her; but, while they were bandying words, they hadunexpectedly overtaken the great concourse of the cortege.
Likewise, at an early stage men were stationed ahead, with Buddhistdrums and gold cymbals, with streamers, and jewelled coverings; and thewhole company of bonzes, belonging to the Iron Fence Temple, had alreadybeen drawn out in a line by the sides of the road. In a short while,they reached the interior of the temple, where additional sacrificeswere offered and Buddhistic services performed; and where altars hadagain been erected to burn incense on. The coffin was deposited in aside room of the inner court; and Pao Chu got ready a bed-room in whichshe could keep her watch.
In the outer apartments, Chia Chen did the honours among the whole partyof relatives and friends, some of whom asked to be allowed to stay fortheir meals, while others at this stage took their leave. And after theyhad one by one returned thanks, the dukes, marquises, earls, viscountsand barons, each in respective batches, (got up to go,) and they kept onleaving from between 1 and 3 p.m. before they had finally all dispersed.
In the inner Chambers, the ladies were solely entertained and attendedto by lady Feng. First to make a move were the consorts of officials;and noon had also come, by the time the whole party of them had takentheir departure. Those that remained were simply a few relatives of thesame clan and others like them, who eventually left after the completionof the three days' rationalistic liturgies.
The two ladies Hsing and Wang, well aware at this time that lady Fengcould on no account return home, desired to enter the city at once; andmadame Wang wanted to take Pao-y� home; but Pao-y�, who had, on anunexpected occasion, come out into the country, entertained, of course,no wish to go back; and he would agree to nothing else than to staybehind with lady Feng, so that madame Wang had no alternative but tohand him over to her charge and to start.
This Temple of the Iron Fence had, in fact, been erected in days goneby, at the expense of the two dukes Ning and Jung; and there stillremained up to these days, acres of land, from which were derived thefunds for incense and lights for such occasions, on which the coffins ofany members, old or young, (who died) in the capital, had to bedeposited in this temple; and the inner and outer houses, in thiscompound were all kept in readiness and good order, for theaccommodation of those who formed part of the cort�ge.
At this time, as it happened, the descendants mustered an immense crowd,and among them were poor and rich of various degrees, or with likes anddislikes diametrically opposed. There were those, who, being instraitened circumstances at home, and easily contented, readily took uptheir quarters in the temple. And there were those with money andposition, and with extravagant ideas, who maintained that theaccommodation in the temple was not suitable, and, of course, went insearch of additional quarters, either in country houses, or in convents,where they could have their meals and retire, after the ceremonies wereover.
On the occasion of Mrs. Ch'in's funeral, all the members of the clan putup temporarily in the Iron Fence Temple; lady Feng alone looked downupon it as inconvenient, and consequently despatched a servant to go andtell Ch'ing Hs�, a nun in the Bread Convent, to empty two rooms for herto go and live in.
This Bread Convent had at one time been styled the Shui Yueh nunnery(water moon); but as good bread was made in that temple, it gave rise tothis nickname.
This convent was not very distant from the Temple of the Iron Fence, sothat as soon as the bonzes brought their functions to a close, and thesacrifice of evening was offered, Chia Chen asked Chia Jung to requestlady Feng to retire to rest; and as lady Feng perceived that there stillremained several sisters-in-law to keep company to the female relatives,she readily, of her own accord, took leave of the whole party, and,along with Pao-y� and Ch'in Chung, came to the Water Moon Convent.
Ch'in Yeh, it must be noticed, was advanced in years and a victim tomany ailments, so that he was unable to remain in the temple long, andhe bade Ch'in Chung tarry until the coffin had been set in its restingplace, with the result that Ch'in Chung came along, at the same time aslady Feng and Pao-y�, to the Water Moon Convent, where Ch'ing Hs�appeared, together with two neophytes, Chih Shan and Chih Neng, toreceive them. After they had exchanged greetings, lady Feng and theothers entered the "chaste" apartments to change their clothes and washtheir hands; and when they had done, as she perceived how much taller instature Chih Neng had grown and how much handsomer were her features,she felt prompted to inquire, "How is it that your prioress andyourselves haven't been all these days as far as our place?"
"It's because during these days we haven't had any time which we couldcall our own," explained Ch'ing Hs�. "Owing to the birth of a son in Mr.Hu's mansion, dame Hu sent over about ten taels and asked that we shouldinvite several head-nuns to read during three days the service for thechurching of women, with the result that we've been so very busy and hadso little leisure, that we couldn't come over to pay our respects toyour ladyship."
But leaving aside the old nun, who kept lady Feng company, we will nowreturn to the two lads Pao-y� and Ch'in Chung. They were up to theirpranks in the main building of the convent, when seeing Chih Neng comeover: "Here's Neng Erh," Pao-y� exclaimed with a smile.
"Why notice a creature like her?" remarked Ch'in Chung; to which Pao-y�rejoined laughingly: "Don't be sly! why then did you the other day, whenyou were in the old lady's rooms, and there was not a soul present, holdher in your arms? and do you want to fool me now ?"
"There was nothing of the kind," observed Ch'in Chung smiling.
"Whether there was or not," replied Pao-y�, "doesn't concern me; but ifyou will stop her and tell her to pour a cup of tea and bring it to meto drink, I'll then keep hands off."
"This is indeed very strange!" Ch'in Chung answered laughing; "do youfear that if you told her to pour you one, that she wouldn't; and whatneed is there that I should tell her?"
"If I ask her," Pao-y� observed, "to pour it, she wouldn't be as readyas she would were you to tell her about it."
Ch'in Chung had no help but to speak. "Neng Erh!" he said, "bring a cupof tea."
This Neng Erh had, since her youth, been in and out of the Jung mansion,so that there was no one that she did not know; and she had also, timeafter time, romped and laughed with Pao-y� and Ch'in Chung. Being nowgrown up she gradually came to know the import of love, and she readilytook a fancy to Ch'in Chung, who was an amorous being. Ch'in Chung tooreturned her affection, on account of her good looks; and, although heand she had not had any very affectionate t�te-�-t�tes, they had,however, long ago come to understand each other's feelings and wishes.
Chih Neng walked away and returned after having poured the tea.
"Give it to me," Ch'in Chung cried out smirkingly; while Pao-y� likewiseshouted: "Give it to me."
Chih Neng compressed her lips and sneeringly rejoined, "Are you going tohave a fight even over a cup of tea? Is it forsooth likely that there'shoney in my hand?"
Pao-y� was the first to grasp and take over the cup, but while drinkingit, he was about to make some inquiry, when he caught sight of ChihShan, who came and called Chih Neng away to go and lay the plates withfruit on the table. Not much time elapsed before she came round torequest the two lads to go and have tea and refreshments; but would theyeat such things as were laid before them? They simply sat for a whileand came out again and resumed their play.
Lady Feng too stayed for a few moments, and then returned, with the oldnun as her escort, into the "unsullied" rooms to lie down. By this time,all the matrons and married women discovered that there was nothing elseto be done, and they dispersed in succession, retiring each to rest.There only remained in attendance several young girls who enjoyed herconfidence, and the old nun speedily availed herself of the opportunityto speak. "I've got something," she said, "about which I mean to go toyour mansion to beg of madame Wang; but I'll first request you, my lady,to tell me how to set to work."
"What's it?" ascertained lady Feng.
"O-mi-to-fu!" exclaimed the old nun, "It's this; in days gone by, Ifirst lived in the Ch'ang An district. When I became a nun and enteredthe monastery of Excellent Merit, there lived, at that time, asubscriber, Chang by surname, a very wealthy man. He had a daughter,whose infant name was Chin Ko; the whole family came in the course ofthat year to the convent I was in, to offer incense, and as luck wouldhave it they met Li Ya-nei, a brother of a secondary wife of the Prefectof the Ch'ang An Prefecture. This Li Ya-nei fell in love at first sightwith her, and would wed Chin Ko as his wife. He sent go-betweens to askher in marriage, but, contrary to his expectations, Chin Ko had alreadyreceived the engagement presents of the son of the ex-Major of theCh'ang An Prefecture. The Chang family, on the other hand, were afraidthat if they withdrew from the match, the Major would not give up hisclaim, and they therefore replied that she was already promised toanother. But, who would have thought it, this Mr. Li was seriously bentupon marrying the young lady. But while the Chang family were at a losswhat plan to devise, and both parties were in a dilemma, the family ofthe Major came unexpectedly to hear of the news; and without evenlooking thoroughly into the matter, they there and then had recourse toinsult and abuse. 'Is a girl,' they insinuated, 'to be promised to thesons of several families!' And obstinately refusing to allow therestitution of the betrothal presents, they at once had recourse tolitigation and brought an action (against the girl's people.) Thatfamily was at their wits' end, and had no alternative but to find someone to go to the capital to obtain means of assistance; and, losing allpatience, they insisted upon the return of the presents. I believe thatthe present commander of the troops at Ch'ang An, Mr. Y�n, is onfriendly terms with your honourable family, and could one solicit madameWang to put in a word with Mr. Chia Cheng to send a letter and ask Mr.Y�n to speak to that Major, I have no fear that he will not agree.Should (your ladyship) be willing to take action, the Chang family areeven ready to present all they have, though it may entail the ruin oftheir estate."
"This affair is, it's true, of no great moment," lady Feng repliedsmiling, after hearing this appeal; "but the only thing is that madameWang does no longer attend to matters of this nature."
"If madame doesn't heed them," suggested the old nun, "you, my lady, cansafely assume the direction."
"I'm neither in need of any money to spend," added lady Feng with asmirk, "nor do I undertake such matters!"
These words did not escape Ching Hs�'s ear; they scattered to the windsher vain hopes. After a minute or so she heaved a sigh.
"What you say may be true enough," she remarked; "but the Chang familyare also aware that I mean to come and make my appeal to your mansion;and were you now not to manage this affair, the Chang family having noidea that the lack of time prevents any steps being taken and that noimportance is attached to their presents, it will appear, on thecontrary, as if there were not even this little particle of skill inyour household."
At these words lady Feng felt at once inspirited. "You've known of old,"she added, "that I've never had any faith in anything concerningretribution in the Court of Judgment in the unseen or in hell; and thatwhatever I say that I shall do, that I do; tell them therefore to bringthree thousand taels; and I shall then remedy this grievance of theirs."
The old nun upon hearing this remark was so exceedingly delighted, thatshe precipitately exclaimed, "They've got it, they've got it! there willbe no difficulty about it."
"I'm not," lady Feng went on to add, "like those people, who afford helpand render assistance with an eye to money; these three thousand taelswill be exclusively devoted for the travelling expenses of those youths,who will be sent to deliver messages and for them to make a few cash fortheir trouble; but as for me I don't want even so much as a cash. Infact I'm able at this very moment to produce as much as thirty thousandtaels."
The old nun assented with alacrity, and said by way of reply, "If thatbe so, my lady, do display your charitable bounty at once to-morrow andbring things to an end."
"Just see," remarked lady Feng, "how hard pressed I am; which place cando without me? but since I've given you my word, I shall, needless tosay, speedily bring the matter to a close."
"A small trifle like this," hinted the old nun, "would, if placed in thehands of any one else, flurry her to such an extent that she would bequite at a loss what to do; but in your hands, my lady, even if muchmore were superadded, it wouldn't require as much exertion as a wave ofyour hand. But the proverb well says: 'that those who are able have muchto do;' for madame Wang, seeing that your ladyship manages all concerns,whether large or small, properly, has still more shoved the burden ofeverything on your shoulders, my lady; but you should, it's but right,also take good care of your precious health."
This string of flattery pleased lady Feng more and more, so thatheedless of fatigue she went on to chat with still greater zest.
But, thing unthought of, Ch'in Chung availed himself of the darkness, aswell as of the absence of any one about, to come in quest of Chih Neng.As soon as he reached the room at the back, he espied Chih Neng allalone inside washing the tea cups; and Ch'in Chung forthwith seized herin his arms and implanted kisses on her cheek. Chih Neng got in adreadful state, and stamping her feet, cried, "What are you up to?" andshe was just on the point of shouting out, when Ch'in Chung rejoined:"My dear girl! I'm nearly dead from impatience, and if you don't againto-day accept my advances, I shall this very moment die on this spot."
"What you're bent upon," added Chih Neng, "can't be effected; not unlessyou wait until I've left this den and parted company from these people,when it will be safe enough."
"This is of course easy enough!" remonstrated Ch'in Chung; "but thedistant water cannot extinguish the close fire!"
As he spoke, with one puff, he put out the light, plunging the wholeroom in pitch darkness; and seizing Chih Neng, he pushed her on to thestove-couch and started a violent love affair. Chih Neng could not,though she strained every nerve, escape his importunities; nor could shevery well shout, so that she felt compelled to humour him; but while hewas in the midst of his ecstatic joy, they perceived a person walk in,who pressed both of them down, without uttering even so much as a sound,and plunged them both in such a fright that their very souls flew awayand their spirits wandered from their bodies; and it was after the thirdparty had burst out laughing with a spurting sound that they eventuallybecame aware that it was Pao-y�; when, springing to his feetimpetuously, Ch'in Chung exclaimed full of resentment, "What's this thatyou're up to!"
"If you get your monkey up," retorted Pao-y�, "why, then let you and Istart bawling out;" which so abashed Chih Neng that she availed herselfof the gloomy light to make her escape; while Pao-y� had dragged Ch'inChung out of the room and asked, "Now then, do you still want to playthe bully!"
"My dear fellow," pleaded Ch'in Chung smilingly, "whatever you do don'tshout out and let every one know; and all you want, I'll agree to."
"We needn't argue just now," Pao-y� observed with a grin; "wait a while,and when all have gone to sleep, we can minutely settle accountstogether."
Soon it was time to ease their clothes, and go to bed; and lady Fengoccupied the inner room; Ch'in Chung and Pao-y� the outer; while thewhole ground was covered with matrons of the household, who had spreadtheir bedding, and sat watching. As lady Feng entertained fears that thejade of Spiritual Perception might be lost, she waited until Pao-y� fellasleep, when having directed a servant to bring it to her, she placed itunder the side of her own pillow.
What accounts Pao-y� settled with Ch'in Chung cannot be ascertained; andas in the absence of any positive proof what is known is based uponsurmises, we shall not venture to place it on record.
Nothing worth noticing occurred the whole night; but the next day, assoon as the morning dawned, dowager lady Chia and madame Wang promptlydespatched servants to come and see how Pao-y� was getting on; and totell him likewise to put on two pieces of extra clothing, and that ifthere was nothing to be done it would be better for him to go back.
But was it likely that Pao-y� would be willing to go back? Besides Ch'inChung, in his inordinate passion for Chih Neng, instigated Pao-y� toentreat lady Feng to remain another day. Lady Feng pondered in her ownmind that, although the most important matters connected with thefuneral ceremonies had been settled satisfactorily, there were still afew minor details, for which no provision had been made, so that couldshe avail herself of this excuse to remain another day would she not winfrom Chia Chen a greater degree of approbation, in the second place,would she not be able further to bring Ch'ing Hs�'s business to anissue, and, in the third place, to humour Pao-y�'s wish? In view ofthese three advantages, which would accrue, "All that I had to do, Ihave done," she readily signified to Pao-y�, "and if you be bent uponrunning about in here, you'll unavoidably place me in still greatertrouble; so that we must for certain start homewards to-morrow."
"My dear cousin, my own dear cousin," urgently entreated Pao-y�, when heheard these words, "let's stay only this one day, and to-morrow we cango back without fail."
They actually spent another night there, and lady Feng availed herselfof their stay to give directions that the case which had been entrustedto her the previous day by the old nun should be secretly communicatedto Lai Wang Erh. Lai Wang's mind grasped the import of all that was saidto him, and, having entered the city with all despatch, he went insearch of the gentleman, who acted as secretary (in Mr. Y�n's office),pretending that he had been directed by Mr. Chia Lien to come and askhim to write a letter and to send it that very night to the Ch'ang Anmagistrate. The distance amounted to no more than one hundred li, sothat in the space of two days everything was brought to a satisfactorysettlement. The general, whose name was Y�n Kuang, had been for a longtime under obligations to the Chia family, so that he naturally couldnot refuse his co-operation in such small trifles. When he had handedhis reply, Wang Erh started on his way back; where we shall leave himand return to lady Feng.
Having spent another day, she on the morrow took leave of the old nun,whom she advised to come to the mansion after the expiry of three daysto fetch a reply.
Ch'in Chung and Chih Neng could not, by any means, brook the separation,and they secretly agreed to a clandestine assignation; but to thesedetails we need not allude with any minuteness; sufficient to say thatthey had no alternative but to bear the anguish and to part.
Lady Feng crossed over again to the temple of the Iron Fence andascertained how things were progressing. But as Pao Chu was obstinate inher refusal to return home, Chia Chen found himself under the necessityof selecting a few servants to act as her companions. But the readermust listen to what is said in the next chapter by way of explanation.

CHAPTER XVI.
  Chia Yuan-ch'un is, on account of her talents, selected to enter the      Feng Ts'ao Palace.  Ch'in Ching-ch'ing departs, in the prime of life, by the yellow spring      road.
But we must now return to the two lads, Ch'in Chung and Pao-y�. Afterthey had passed, along with lady Feng from the Temple of the Iron Fence,whither she had gone to see how things were getting on, they entered thecity in their carriages. On their arrival at home, they paid theirobeisance to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and the other members of thefamily, whence they returned to their own quarters, where nothing worthmentioning transpired during the night.
On the next day, Pao-y� perceiving that the repairs to the outerschoolroom had been completed, settled with Ch'in Chung that they shouldhave evening classes. But as it happened that Ch'in Chung, who wasnaturally of an extremely delicate physique, caught somewhat of a chillin the country and clandestinely indulged, besides, in an intimacy withChih Neng, which unavoidably made him fail to take good care of himself,he was, shortly after his return, troubled with a cough and a feverishcold, with nausea for drink and food, and fell into such an extremelypoor state of health that he simply kept indoors and nursed himself, andwas not in a fit condition to go to school. Pao-y�'s spirits werereadily damped, but as there was likewise no remedy he had no othercourse than to wait until his complete recovery, before he could makeany arrangements.
Lady Feng had meanwhile received a reply from Y�n Kuang, in which heinformed her that everything had been satisfactorily settled, and theold nun apprised the Chang family that the major had actually suppressedhis indignation, hushed his complaints, and taken back the presents ofthe previous engagement. But who would have ever anticipated that afather and mother, whose hearts were set upon position and theirambition upon wealth, could have brought up a daughter so conscious ofpropriety and so full of feeling as to seize the first opportunity,after she had heard that she had been withdrawn from her formerintended, and been promised to the Li family, to stealthily devise a wayto commit suicide, by means of a handkerchief. The son of the Major,upon learning that Chin Ko had strangled herself, there and then jumpedinto the river and drowned himself, as he too was a being full of love.The Chang and Li families were, sad to relate, very much cut up, and, invery truth, two lives and money had been sacrificed all to no use.
Lady Feng, however, during this while, quietly enjoyed the threethousand taels, and madame Wang did not have even so much as thefaintest idea of the whole matter. But ever since this occasion, ladyFeng's audacity acquired more and more strength; and the actions of thiskind, which she, in after days, performed, defy enumeration.
One day, the very day on which Chia Cheng's birthday fell, while themembers of the two households of Ning and Jung were assembled togetheroffering their congratulations, and unusual bustle and stir prevailed, agatekeeper came in, at quite an unexpected moment, to announce that Mr.Hsia, Metropolitan Head Eunuch of the six palaces, had come with thespecial purpose of presenting an edict from his Majesty; a bit of newswhich plunged Chia She, Chia Cheng and the whole company into greatconsternation, as they could not make out what was up. Speedilyinterrupting the theatrical performance, they had the banquet cleared,and the altar laid out with incense, and opening the centre gate theyfell on their knees to receive the edict.
Soon they caught sight of the head eunuch, Hsia Ping-chung, advancing onhorseback, and besides himself, a considerable retinue of eunuchs. Theeunuch Hsia did not, in fact, carry any mandate or present any decree;but straightway advancing as far as the main hall, he dismounted, and,with a face beaming with smiles, he walked into the Hall and took hisstand on the southern side.
"I have had the honour," he said, "of receiving a special order to atonce summon Chia Cheng to present himself at Court and be admitted inHis Majesty's presence in the Lin Ching Hall."
When he had delivered this message, he did not so much as take any tea,but forthwith mounted his horse and took his leave.
Chia Cheng and the others could not even conceive what omen this summonsimplied, but he had no alternative but to change his clothes with allhaste and to present himself at Court, while dowager lady Chia and theinmates of the whole household were, in their hearts, a prey to suchperplexity and uncertainty that they incessantly despatched messengerson flying steeds to go and bring the news.
After the expiry of four hours, they suddenly perceived Lai Ta and threeor four other butlers run in, quite out of breath, through theceremonial gate and report the glad tidings. "We have received," theyadded, "our master's commands, to hurriedly request her venerableladyship to take madame Wang and the other ladies into the Palace, toreturn thanks for His Majesty's bounty;" and other words to the samepurport.
Dowager lady Chia was, at this time, standing, with agitated heart,under the verandah of the Large Hall waiting for tidings, whilst the twoladies, mesdames Hsing and Wang, Mrs. Yu, Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying Ch'unand her sisters, even up to Mrs. Hs�eh and the rest, were congregated inone place ascertaining what was the news. Old lady Chia likewise calledLai Ta in and minutely questioned him as to what had happened. "Yourservants," replied Lai Ta, "simply stood waiting outside the Lin Chuanggate, so that we were in total ignorance of what was going on inside,when presently the Eunuch Hsia came out and imparted to us the gladtidings; telling us that the eldest of the young ladies in our householdhad been raised, by His Majesty, to be an overseer in the Feng Ts'aoPalace, and that he had, in addition, conferred upon her the rank ofworthy and virtuous secondary consort. By and by, Mr. Chia Cheng cameout and also told us the same thing. Master is now gone back again tothe Eastern Palace, whither he requests your venerable ladyship to go atonce and offer thanks for the Imperial favour."
When old lady Chia and the other members of the family heard thesetidings they were at length reassured in their minds, and so elated werethey all in one moment that joy was visible in their very faces. Withoutloss of time, they commenced to don the gala dresses suitable to theirrank; which done, old lady Chia led the way for the two ladies, mesdamesHsing and Wang, as well as for Mrs. Yu; and their official chairs, fourof them in all, entered the palace like a trail of fish; while Chia Sheand Chia Chen, who had likewise changed their clothes for their courtdress, took Chia Se and Chia Jung along and proceeded in attendance upondowager lady Chia.
Indeed, of the two households of Ning and Jung, there was not one,whether high or low, woman or man, who was not in a high state ofexultation, with the exception of Pao-y�, who behaved just as if thenews had not reached his ears; and can you, reader, guess why? The factis that Chih Neng, of the Water Moon Convent, had recently entered thecity in a surreptitious manner in search of Ch'in Chung; but, contraryto expectation, her visit came to be known by Ch'in Yeh, who drove ChihNeng away and laid hold of Ch'in Chung and gave him a flogging. But thisoutburst of temper of his brought about a relapse of his old complaint,with the result that in three or five days, he, sad to say, succumbed.Ch'in Chung had himself ever been in a delicate state of health and hadbesides received a caning before he had got over his sickness, so thatwhen he now saw his aged father pass away from the consequences of a fitof anger, he felt, at this stage, so full of penitence and distress thatthe symptoms of his illness were again considerably aggravated. Hence itwas that Pao-y� was downcast and unhappy at heart, and that nothingcould, in spite of the promotion of Yuan Ch'un by imperial favour,dispel the depression of his spirits.
Dowager lady Chia and the rest in due course offered thanks and returnedhome, the relatives and friends came to present their congratulations,great stir and excitement prevailed during these few days in the twomansions of Ning and Jung, and every one was in high glee; but he alonelooked upon everything as if it were nothing; taking not the leastinterest in anything; and as this reason led the whole family to sneerat him, the result was that he got more and more doltish.
Luckily, however, Chia Lien and Tai-y� were on their way back, and haddespatched messengers, in advance, to announce the news that they wouldbe able to reach home the following day, so that when Pao-y� heard thetidings, he was at length somewhat cheered. And when he came toinstitute minute inquiries, he eventually found out: "that Chia Y�-ts'unwas also coming to the capital to have an audience with His Majesty,that it was entirely because Wang Tzu-t'eng had repeatedly laid beforethe Throne memorials recommending him that he was coming on thisoccasion to wait in the metropolis for a vacancy which he could fill up;that as he was a kinsman of Chia Lien's, acknowledging the sameancestors as he did, and he stood, on the other hand, with Tai-y�, inthe relationship of tutor and pupil, he was in consequence following thesame road and coming as their companion; that Lin Ju-hai had alreadybeen buried in the ancestral vault, and that every requirement had beenattended to with propriety; that Chia Lien, on this voyage to thecapital, would, had he progressed by the ordinary stages, have been overa month before he could reach home, but that when he came to hear thegood news about Yuan Ch'un, he pressed on day and night to enter thecapital; and that the whole journey had been throughout, in everyrespect, both pleasant and propitious."
But Pao-y� merely ascertained whether Tai-y� was all right, and did noteven so much as trouble his mind with the rest of what he heard; and heremained on the tiptoe of expectation, till noon of the morrow; when, inpoint of fact, it was announced that Mr. Lien, together with Miss Lin,had made their entrance into the mansion. When they came face to face,grief and joy vied with each other; and they could not help having agood cry for a while; after which followed again expressions of sympathyand congratulations; while Pao-y� pondered within himself that Tai-y�had become still more surpassingly handsome.
Tai-y� had also brought along with her a good number of books, and shepromptly gave orders that the sleeping rooms should be swept, and thatthe various nicknacks should be put in their proper places. She furtherproduced a certain quantity of paper, pencils and other such things, anddistributed them among Pao Ch'ai, Ying Ch'un, Pao-y� and the rest; andPao-y� also brought out, with extreme care, the string of Ling-lingscented beads, which had been given to him by the Prince of Pei Ching,and handed them, in his turn, to Tai-y� as a present.
"What foul man has taken hold of them?" exclaimed Tai-y�. "I don't wantany such things;" and as she forthwith dashed them down, and would notaccept them, Pao-y� was under the necessity of taking them back. But forthe time being we will not allude to them, but devote our attention toChia Lien.
Having, after his arrival home, paid his salutations to all the inmates,he retired to his own quarters at the very moment that lady Feng hadmultifarious duties to attend to, and had not even a minute to spare;but, considering that Chia Lien had returned from a distant journey, shecould not do otherwise than put by what she had to do, and to greet himand wait on him.
"Imperial uncle," she said, in a jocose manner, when she realised thatthere was no outsider present in the room, "I congratulate you! Whatfatigue and hardship you, Imperial uncle, have had to bear throughoutthe whole journey, your humble servant heard yesterday, when the couriersent ahead came and announced that Your Highness would this day reachthis mansion. I have merely got ready a glass of mean wine for you towipe down the dust with, but I wonder, whether Your Highness will deignto bestow upon it the lustre of your countenance, and accept it."
Chia Lien smiled. "How dare I presume to such an honour," he added byway of rejoinder; "I'm unworthy of such attention! Many thanks, manythanks."
P'ing Erh and the whole company of waiting-maids simultaneously paidtheir obeisance to him, and this ceremony concluded, they presented tea.Chia Lien thereupon made inquiries about the various matters, which hadtranspired in their home after his departure, and went on to thank ladyFeng for all the trouble she had taken in the management of them.
"How could I control all these manifold matters," remarked lady Feng;"my experience is so shallow, my speech so dull and my mind so simple,that if any one showed me a club, I would mistake it for a pin. Besides,I'm so tender-hearted that were any one to utter a couple of glibremarks, I couldn't help feeling my heart give way to compassion andsympathy. I've had, in addition, no experience in any weighty questions;my pluck is likewise so very small that when madame Wang has felt in theleast displeased, I have not been able to close my eyes and sleep.Urgently did I more than once resign the charge, but her ladyshipwouldn't again agree to it; maintaining, on the contrary, that my objectwas to be at ease, and that I was not willing to reap experience.Leaving aside that she doesn't know that I take things so much to heart,that I can scoop the perspiration in handfuls, that I daren't utter oneword more than is proper, nor venture to recklessly take one step morethan I ought to, you know very well which of the women servants, incharge of the menage in our household, is easy to manage! If ever I makethe slightest mistake, they laugh at me and poke fun at me; and if Iincline a little one way, they show their displeasure by innuendoes;they sit by and look on, they use every means to do harm, they stir uptrouble, they stand by on safe ground and look on and don't give ahelping hand to lift any one they have thrown over, and they are, oneand all of them, old hands in such tricks. I'm moreover young in yearsand not able to keep people in check, so that they naturally don't showany regard for me! What is still more ridiculous is that after the deathof Jung Erh's wife in that mansion, brother Chen, time and again, beggedmadame Wang, on his very knees, to do him the favour to ask me to lendhim a hand for several days. I repeatedly signified my refusal, but herladyship gave her consent in order to oblige him, so that I had no helpbut to carry out her wish; putting, as is my wont, everythingtopsy-turvey, and making matters worse than they were; with the resultthat brother Chen up to this day bears me a grudge and regrets havingasked for my assistance. When you see him to-morrow, do what you can toexcuse me by him. 'Young as she is,' tell him, 'and without experienceof the world, who ever could have instigated Mr. Chia Cheng to make sucha mistake as to choose her.'"
While they were still chatting, they heard people talking in the outerapartments, and lady Feng speedily inquired who it was. P'ing Erhentered the room to reply. "Lady Hs�eh," she said, "has sent sisterHsiang Ling over to ask me something; but I've already given her myanswer and sent her back."
"Quite so," interposed Chia Lien with a smile. "A short while ago I wentto look up Mrs. Hs�eh and came face to face with a young girl, whosefeatures were supremely perfect, and as I suspected that, in ourhousehold, there was no such person, I asked in the course ofconversation, Mrs. Hs�eh about her, and found out eventually that thiswas the young waiting-maid they had purchased on their way to thecapital, Hsiang Ling by name, and that she had after all become aninmate of the household of that big fool Hs�eh. Since she's had her hairdressed as a married woman she does look so much more pre-eminentlybeautiful! But that big fool Hs�eh has really brought contamination uponher."
"Ai!" exclaimed lady Feng, "here you are back from a trip to Suchow andHang Chow, where you should have seen something of the world! and haveyou still an eye as envious and a heart so covetous? Well, if you wishto bestow your love on her, there's no difficulty worth speaking of.I'll take P'ing Erh over and exchange her for her; what do you say tothat? that old brother Hs�eh is also one of those men, who, while eatingwhat there is in the bowl, keeps an eye on what there is in the pan! Forthe last year or so, as he couldn't get Hsiang Ling to be his, he madeever so many distressing appeals to Mrs. Hs�eh; and Mrs. Hs�eh whileesteeming Hsiang Ling's looks, though fine, as after all a small matter,(thought) her deportment and conduct so far unlike those of other girls,so gentle and so demure that almost the very daughters of masters andmistresses couldn't attain her standard, that she therefore went to thetrouble of spreading a banquet, and of inviting guests, and in opencourt, and in the legitimate course, she gave her to him for a secondarywife. But half a month had scarcely elapsed before he looked upon heralso as a good-for-nothing person as he did upon a large number of them!I can't however help feeling pity for her in my heart."
Scarcely had she time to conclude what she had to say when a youth, onduty at the second gate, transmitted the announcement that Mr. ChiaCheng was in the Library waiting for Mr. Secundus. At these words, ChiaLien speedily adjusted his clothes, and left the apartment; and duringhis absence, lady Feng inquired of P'ing Erh what Mrs. Hs�eh wanted afew minutes back, that she sent Hsiang Ling round in such a hurry.
"What Hsiang Ling ever came?" replied P'ing Erh. "I simply made use ofher name to tell a lie for the occasion. Tell me, my lady, (what's cometo) Wang Erh's wife? why she's got so bad that there's even no commonsense left in her!" Saying this she again drew near lady Feng's side,and in a soft tone of voice, she continued: "That interest of yours, mylady, she doesn't send later, nor does she send it sooner; but she mustsend it round the very moment when master Secundus is at home! But asluck would have it, I was in the hall, so that I came across her;otherwise, she would have walked in and told your ladyship, and Mr.Secundus would naturally have come to know about it! And our masterwould, with that frame of mind of his, have fished it out and spent it,had the money even been at the bottom of a pan full of oil! and were heto have heard that my lady had private means, would he not have beenstill more reckless in spending? Hence it was that, losing no time intaking the money over, I had to tell her a few words which, who wouldhave thought, happened to be overheard by your ladyship; that's why, inthe presence of master Secundus, I simply explained that Hsiang Ling hadcome!"
These words evoked a smile from lady Feng. "Mrs. Hsueh, I thought tomyself," she observed, "knows very well that your Mr. Secundus has come,and yet, regardless of propriety, she, instead (of keeping her at home),sends some one over from her inner rooms! and it was you after all, youvixen, playing these pranks!"
As she uttered this remark, Chia Lien walked in, and lady Feng issuedorders to serve the wine and the eatables, and husband and wife tooktheir seats opposite to each other; but notwithstanding that lady Fengwas very partial to drink, she nevertheless did not have the courage toindulge her weakness, but merely partook of some to keep him company.Chia Lien's nurse, dame Chao, entered the room, and Chia Lien and ladyFeng promptly pressed her to have a glass of wine, and bade her sit onthe stove-couch, but dame Chao was obstinate in her refusal. P'ing Erhand the other waiting-maids had at an early hour placed a square stoolnext to the edge of the couch, where was likewise a small footstool, andon this footstool dame Chao took a seat, whereupon Chia Lien chose twodishes of delicacies from the table, which he handed her to place on thesquare stool for her own use.
"Dame Chao," lady Feng remarked, "couldn't very well bite through that,for mind it might make her teeth drop! This morning," she thereforeasked of P'ing Erh, "I suggested that that shoulder of pork stewed withham was so tender as to be quite the thing to be given to dame Chao toeat; and how is it you haven't taken it over to her? But go at once andtell them to warm it and bring it in! Dame Chao," she went on, "just youtaste this Hui Ch'�an wine brought by your foster-son."
"I'll drink it," replied dame Chao, "but you, my lady, must also have acup: what's there to fear? the one thing to guard against is any excess,that's all! But I've now come over, not for any wine or eatables; on thecontrary, there's a serious matter, which I would ask your ladyship toimpress on your mind, and to show me some regard, for this master ofours is only good to utter fine words, but when the time (to act) doescome, he forgets all about us! As I have had the good fortune to nursehim in his infancy and to bring him up to this age, 'I too have grownold in years,' I said to him, 'and all that belong to me are those twosons, and do look upon them with some particular favour!' With any oneelse I shouldn't have ventured to open my mouth, but him I anywayentreated time and again on several occasions. His assent was of coursewell and good, but up to this very moment he still withholds his help.Now besides from the heavens has dropped such a mighty piece of goodluck; and in what place will there be no need of servants? that's why Icome to tell you, my lady, as is but right, for were I to depend uponour master, I fear I shall even die of starvation."
Lady Feng laughed. "You'd better," she suggested, "put those two elderfoster brothers of his both under my charge! But you've nursed thatfoster-son from his babyhood, and don't you yet know that disposition ofhis, how that he takes his skin and flesh and sticks it, (not on thebody of a relative), but, on the contrary, on that of an outsider andstranger? (to Chia Lien.) Which of those foster brothers whom you havenow discarded, isn't clearly better than others? and were you to haveshown them some favour and consideration, who would have ventured tohave said 'don't?' Instead of that, you confer benefits upon thoroughstrangers, and all to no purpose whatever! But these words of mine arealso incorrect, eh? for those whom we regard as strangers you,contrariwise, will treat just as if they were relatives!"
At these words every one present in the room burst out laughing; evennurse Chao could not repress herself; and as she invoked Buddha,--"Invery truth," she exclaimed, "in this room has sprung up a kind-heartedperson! as regards relatives and strangers, such foolish distinctionsaren't drawn by our master; and it's simply because he's full of pityand is tenderhearted that he can't put off any one who gives vent to afew words of entreaty, and nothing else!"
"That's quite it!" rejoined lady Feng smiling sarcastically, "to thosewhom he looks upon as relatives, he's kindhearted, but with me and hismother he's as hard as steel."
"What you say, my lady, is very considerate," remarked nurse Chao, "andI'm really so full of delight that I'll have another glass of good wine!and, if from this time forward, your ladyship will act as you thinkbest, I'll have then nothing to be sorry for!"
Chia Lien did not at this juncture feel quite at his ease, but he coulddo no more than feign a smile. "You people," he said, "should leave offtalking nonsense, and bring the eatables at once and let us have ourmeal, as I have still to go on the other side and see Mr. Chia Chen, toconsult with him about business."
"To be sure you have," ventured lady Feng, "and you shouldn't neglectyour legitimate affairs; but what did Mr. Chia Chen tell you when hesent for you just a while back?"
"It was about the visit (of Yuan Ch'un) to her parents," Chia Lienexplained.
"Has after all permission for the visit been granted?" lady Fenginquired with alacrity.
"Though not quite granted," Chia Lien replied joyously, "it'snevertheless more or less an accomplished fact."
"This is indeed evidence of the great bounty of the present Emperor!"lady Feng observed smirkingly; "one doesn't hear in books, or see inplays, written from time to time, any mention of such an instance, evenso far back as the days of old!"
Dame Chao took up again the thread of the conversation. "Indeed it'sso!" she interposed; "But I'm in very truth quite stupid from old age,for I've heard every one, high and low, clamouring during these fewdays, something or other about 'Hsing Ch'in' or no 'Hsing Ch'in,' but Ididn't really pay any heed to it; and now again, here's something moreabout this 'Hsing Ch'in,' but what's it all about, I wonder?"
"The Emperor at present on the Throne," explained Chia Lien, "takes intoconsideration the feelings of his people. In the whole world, there is(in his opinion), no more essential thing than filial piety; maintainingthat the feelings of father, mother, son and daughter areindiscriminately subject to one principle, without any distinctionbetween honorable and mean. The present Emperor himself day and nightwaits upon their majesties his Father and the Empress Dowager, and yetcannot, in the least degree, carry out to the full his ideal of filialpiety. The secondary consorts, meritorious persons and other inmates ofthe Palace, he remembered, had entered within its precincts many yearsback, casting aside fathers and mothers, so how could they not helpthinking of them? Besides, the fathers and mothers, who remain at homemust long for their daughters, of whom they cannot get even so much as aglimpse, and if, through this solicitude, they were to contract anyillness, the harmony of heaven would also be seriously impaired, so forthis reason, he memorialised the Emperor, his father, and the EmpressDowager that every month, on the recurrence of the second and sixthdays, permission should be accorded to the relatives of the imperialconsorts to enter the palace and make application to see theirdaughters. The Emperor, his father, and Empress Dowager were, forthwith,much delighted by this representation, and eulogised, in high terms, thepiety and generosity of the present Emperor, his regard for the will ofheaven and his research into the nature of things. Both their sacredMajesties consequently also issued a decree to the effect: that theentrance of the relatives of the imperial consorts into the Palace couldnot but interfere with the dignity of the state, and the rules ofconventional rites, but that as the mothers and daughters could notgratify the wishes of their hearts, Their Majesties would, after all,show a high proof of expedient grace, and issue a special command that:'exclusive of the generous bounty, by virtue of which the worthyrelations of the imperial consorts could enter the palace on the secondand sixth days, any family, having extensive accommodation and separatecourts suitable for the cantonment of the imperial body-guard, could,without any detriment, make application to the Inner Palace, for theentrance of the imperial chair into the private residences, to the endthat the personal feelings of relations might be gratified, and thatthey should collectively enjoy the bliss of a family reunion.' After theissue of this decree, who did not leap from grateful joy! The father ofthe honourable secondary consort Chou has now already initiated works,in his residence, for the repairs to the separate courts necessary forthe visiting party. Wu T'ien-yu too, the father of Wu, the distinguishedconsort, has likewise gone outside the city walls in search of asuitable plot of ground; and don't these amount to well-nighaccomplished facts?"
"O-mi-to-fu!" exclaimed dame Chao. "Is it really so? but from what yousay, our family will also be making preparations for the reception ofthe eldest young lady!"
"That goes without saying," added Chia Lien, "otherwise, for whatpurpose could we be in such a stir just now?"
"It's of course so!" interposed lady Feng smiling, "and I shall now havean opportunity of seeing something great of the world. My misfortune isthat I'm young by several years; for had I been born twenty or thirtyyears sooner, all these old people wouldn't really be now treating mecontemptuously for not having seen the world! To begin with, the EmperorTai Tsu, in years gone by, imitated the old policy of Shun, and went ona tour, giving rise to more stir than any book could have ever produced;but I happen to be devoid of that good fortune which could have enabledme to come in time."
"Ai ya, ya!" ejaculated dame Chao, "such a thing is rarely met with in athousand years! I was old enough at that time to remember theoccurrence! Our Chia family was then at Ku Su, Yangchow and all alongthat line, superintending the construction of ocean vessels, and therepairs to the seaboard. This was the only time in which preparationswere made for the reception of the Emperor, and money was lavished inquantities as great as the billowing waters of the sea!"
This subject once introduced, lady Feng took up the thread of theconversation with vehemence. "Our Wang family," she said, "did also makepreparations on one occasion. At that time my grandfather was in solecharge of all matters connected with tribute from various states, aswell as with general lev�es, so that whenever any foreigners arrived,they all came to our house to be entertained, while the whole of thegoods, brought by foreign vessels from the two Kuang provinces, fromFukien, Yunnan and Chekiang, were the property of our family."
"Who isn't aware of these facts?" ventured dame Chao; "there is up tothis day a saying that, 'in the eastern sea, there was a white jade bedrequired, and the dragon prince came to request Mr. Wang of Chin Ling(to give it to him)!' This saying relates to your family, my lady, andremains even now in vogue. The Chen family of Chiang Nan has recentlyheld, oh such a fine old standing! it alone has entertained the Emperoron four occasions! Had we not seen these things with our own eyes, werewe to tell no matter whom, they wouldn't surely ever believe them! Notto speak of the money, which was as plentiful as mud, all things,whether they were to be found in the world or not, were they not heapedup like hills, and collected like the waters of the sea? But with thefour characters representing sin and pity they didn't however troubletheir minds."
"I've often heard," continued lady Feng, "my eldest uncle say thatthings were in such a state, and how couldn't I believe? but whatsurprises me is how it ever happened that this family attained suchopulence and honour!"
"I'll tell your ladyship and all in one sentence," replied nurse Chao."Why they simply took the Emperor's money and spent it for the Emperor'sperson, that's all! for what family has such a lot of money as toindulge in this useless extravagance?"
While they were engaged in this conversation, a servant came a secondtime, at the instance of madame Wang, to see whether lady Feng hadfinished her meal or not; and lady Feng forthwith concluding that theremust be something waiting for her to attend to, hurriedly rushed throughher repast. She had just rinsed her mouth and was about to start whenthe youths, on duty at the second gate, also reported that the twogentlemen, Mr. Chia Jung and Mr. Chia Se, belonging to the Easternmansion, had arrived.
Chia Lien had, at length, rinsed his mouth; but while P'ing Erhpresented a basin for him to wash his hands, he perceived the two youngmen walk in, and readily inquired of them what they had to say.
Lady Feng was, on account (of their arrival), likewise compelled tostay, and she heard Chia Jung take the lead and observe: "My father hassent me to tell you, uncle, that the gentlemen, have already decidedthat the whole extent of ground, starting from the East side, borrowing(for the occasion) the flower garden of the Eastern mansion, straight upto the North West, had been measured and found to amount in all to threeand a half li; that it will be suitable for the erection of extraaccommodation for the visiting party; that they have alreadycommissioned an architect to draw a plan, which will be ready byto-morrow; that as you, uncle, have just returned home, and mustunavoidably feel fatigued, you need not go over to our house, but thatif you have anything to say you should please come tomorrow morning, asearly as you can, and consult verbally with him."
"Thank uncle warmly," Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, "for the trouble hehas taken in thinking of me; I shall, in that case, comply with hiswishes and not go over. This plan is certainly the proper one, for whiletrouble will thus be saved, the erection of the quarters will likewisebe an easy matter; for had a distinct plot to be selected and to bepurchased, it would involve far greater difficulties. What's more,things wouldn't, after all, be what they properly should be. When youget back, tell your father that this decision is the right one, and thatshould the gentlemen have any further wish to introduce any change intheir proposals, it will rest entirely with my uncle to prevent them, asit's on no account advisable to go and cast one's choice on some otherplot; that to-morrow as soon as it's daylight, I'll come and pay myrespects to uncle, when we can enter into further details in ourdeliberations!"
Chia Jung hastily signified his assent by several yes's, and Chia Sealso came forward to deliver his message. "The mission to Ku Su," heexplained, "to find tutors, to purchase servant girls, and to obtainmusical instruments, and theatrical properties and the like, my unclehas confided to me; and as I'm to take along with me the two sons of acouple of majordomos, and two companions of the family, besides, TanP'ing-jen and Pei Ku-hsiu, he has, for this reason, enjoined me to comeand see you, uncle."
Upon hearing this, Chia Lien scrutinised Chia Se. "What!" he asked, "areyou able to undertake these commissions? These matters are, it's true,of no great moment; but there's something more hidden in them!"
Chia Se smiled. "The best thing I can do," he remarked, "will be toexecute them in my novice sort of way, that's all."
Chia Jung was standing next to lady Feng, out of the light of the lamp,and stealthily pulled the lapel of her dress. Lady Feng understood thehint, and putting on a smiling expression, "You are too full of fears!"she interposed. "Is it likely that our uncle Chen doesn't, after all,know better than we do what men to employ, that you again give way toapprehensions that he isn't up to the mark! but who are those who are,in every respect, up to the mark? These young fellows have grown upalready to this age, and if they haven't eaten any pork, they havenevertheless seen a pig run. If Mr. Chen has deputed him to go, he issimply meant to sit under the general's standard; and do you imagine,forsooth, that he has, in real earnest, told him to go and bargain aboutthe purchase money, and to interview the brokers himself? My own idea isthat (the choice) is a very good one."
"Of course it is!" observed Chia Lien; "but it isn't that I entertainany wish to be factious; my only object is to devise some plan or otherfor him. Whence will," he therefore went on to ask, "the money requiredfor this purpose come from?"
"A little while ago the deliberations reached this point," rejoined ChiaSe; "and Mr. Lai suggested that there was no necessity at all to takeany funds from the capital, as the Chen family, in Chiang Nan, had stillin their possession Tls. 50,000 of our money. That he would to-morrowwrite a letter of advice and a draft for us to take along, and that weshould, first of all, obtain cash to the amount of Tls. 30,000, and letthe balance of Tls. 20,000 remain over, for the purchase of paintedlanterns, and coloured candles, as well as for the outlay for every kindof portieres, banners, curtains and streamers."
Chia Lien nodded his head. "This plan is first-rate!" he added.
"Since that be so," observed lady Feng, as she addressed herself to ChiaSe, "I've two able and reliable men; and if you would take them withyou, to attend to these matters, won't it be to your convenience?"
Chia Se forced a smile. "I was just on the point," he rejoined, "ofasking you, aunt, for the loan of two men, so that this suggestion is astrange coincidence."
As he went on to ascertain what were their names, lady Feng inquiredwhat they were of nurse Chao. But nurse Chao had, by this time, becomequite dazed from listening to the conversation, and P'ing Erh had togive her a push, as she smiled, before she returned to consciousness."The one," she hastened to reply, "is called Chao T'ien-liang and theother Chao T'ien-tung."
"Whatever you do," suggested lady Feng, "don't forget them; but now I'moff to look after my duties."
With these words, she left the room, and Chia Jung promptly followed herout, and with gentle voice he said to her: "Of whatever you want, aunt,issue orders that a list be drawn up, and I'll give it to my brother totake with him, and he'll carry out your commissions according to thelist."
"Don't talk nonsense!" replied lady Feng laughing; "I've found no place,as yet, where I could put away all my own things; and do the stealthypractices of you people take my fancy?"
As she uttered these words she straightway went her way.
Chia Se, at this time, likewise, asked Chia Lien: "If you want anything(in the way of curtains), I can conveniently have them woven for you,along with the rest, and bring them as a present to you."
"Don't be in such high glee!" Chia Lien urged with a grin, "you've butrecently been learning how to do business, and have you come first andforemost to excel in tricks of this kind? If I require anything, I'll ofcourse write and tell you, but we needn't talk about it."
Having finished speaking, he dismissed the two young men; and, in quicksuccession, servants came to make their business reports, not limited tothree and five companies, but as Chia Lien felt exhausted, he forthwithsent word to those on duty at the second gate not to allow any one atall to communicate any reports, and that the whole crowd should waittill the next day, when he would give his mind to what had to be done.
Lady Feng did not come to retire to rest till the third watch; butnothing need be said about the whole night.
The next morning, at an early hour, Chia Lien got up and called on ChiaShe and Chia Cheng; after which, he came over to the Ning Kuo mansion;when, in company with the old major-domos and other servants, as well aswith several old family friends and companions, he inspected the groundsof the two mansions, and drew plans of the palatial buildings (for theaccommodation of the Imperial consort and her escort) on her visit toher parents; deliberating at the same time, on the subject of the worksand workmen.
From this day the masons and workmen of every trade were collected tothe full number; and the articles of gold, silver, copper, and pewter,as well as the earth, timber, tiles, and bricks, were brought over, andcarried in, in incessant supplies. In the first place, orders wereissued to the workmen to demolish the wall and towers of the garden ofConcentrated Fragrance, and extend a passage to connect in a straightline with the large court in the East of the Jung mansion; for the wholeextent of servants' quarters on the Eastern side of the Jung mansion hadpreviously been pulled down.
The two residences of Ning and Jung were, in these days, it is true,divided by a small street, which served as a boundary line, and therewas no communication between them, but this narrow passage was alsoprivate property, and not in any way a government street, so that theycould easily be connected, and as in the garden of ConcentratedFragrance, there was already a stream of running water, which had beenintroduced through the corner of the Northern wall, there was no furtherneed now of going to the trouble of bringing in another. Although therockeries and trees were not sufficient, the place where Chia She lived,was an old garden of the Jung mansion, so that the bamboos, trees, androckeries in that compound, as well as the arbours, railings and othersuch things could all be very well removed to the front; and by thesemeans, these two grounds, situated as they were besides so very near toeach other, could, by being thrown into one, conduce to the saving ofconsiderable capital and labour; for, in spite of some deficiency, whathad to be supplied did not amount to much. And it devolved entirely upona certain old Hu, a man of note, styled Shan Tzu-yeh, to deliberate uponone thing after another, and to initiate its construction.
Chia Cheng was not up to these ordinary matters, so that it fell to ChiaShe, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Lai Ta, Lai Sheng, Lin Chih-hsiao, WuHsin-teng, Chan Kuang, Ch'eng Jih-hsing and several others to allot thesites, to set things in order, (and to look after) the heaping up ofrockeries, the digging of ponds, the construction of two-storiedbuildings, the erection of halls, the plantation of bamboos and thecultivation of flowers, everything connected with the improvement of thescenery devolving, on the other hand, upon Shan Tzu-yeh to makeprovision for, and after leaving Court, he would devote such leisuremoments as he had to merely going everywhere to give a look at the mostimportant spots, and to consult with Chia She and the others; afterwhich he troubled his mind no more with anything. And as Chia She didnothing else than stay at home and lie off, whenever any matter turnedup, trifling though it may have been as a grain of mustard seed or abean, Chia Chen and his associates had either to go and report it inperson or to write a memorandum of it. Or if he had anything to say, hesent for Chia Lien, Lai Ta and others to come and receive hisinstructions. Chia Jung had the sole direction of the manufacture of thearticles in gold and silver; and as for Chia Se, he had already set outon his journey to Ku Su. Chia Chen, Lai Ta and the rest had also to callout the roll with the names of the workmen, to superintend the works andother duties relative thereto, which could not be recorded by one penalone; sufficient to say that a great bustle and stir prevailed, but tothis subject we shall not refer for a time, but allude to Pao-y�.
As of late there were in the household concerns of this magnitude toattend to, Chia Cheng did not come to examine him in his lessons, sothat he was, of course, in high spirits, but, as unfortunately Ch'inChung's complaint became, day by day, more serious, he was at the sametime really so very distressed at heart on his account, that enjoymentwas for him out of the question.
On this day, he got up as soon as it was dawn, and having just combedhis hair and washed his face and hands, he was bent upon going to askdowager lady Chia to allow him to pay a visit to Ch'in Chung, when hesuddenly espied Ming Yen peep round the curtain-wall at the second gate,and then withdraw his head. Pao-y� promptly walked out and inquired whathe was up to.
"Mr. Ch'in Chung," observed Ming Yen, "is not well at all."
Pao-y� at these words was quite taken aback. "It was only yesterday," hehastily added, "that I saw him, and he was still bright and cheery; andhow is it that he's anything but well now?"
"I myself can't explain," replied Ming Yen; "but just a few minutes agoan old man belonging to his family came over with the express purpose ofgiving me the tidings."
Upon hearing this news, Pao-y� there and then turned round and tolddowager lady Chia; and the old lady issued directions to depute sometrustworthy persons to accompany him. "Let him go," (she said), "andsatisfy his feelings towards his fellow-scholar; but as soon as he hasdone, he must come back; and don't let him tarry too long."
Pao-y� with hurried step left the room and came and changed his clothes.But as on his arrival outside, the carriage had not as yet been gotready, he fell into such a state of excitement, that he went round andround all over the hall in quite an erratic manner. In a short while,after pressure had been brought to bear, the carriage arrived, andspeedily mounting the vehicle, he drove up to the door of Ch'in Chung'shouse, followed by Li Kuei, Ming Yen and the other servants. Everythingwas quiet. Not a soul was about. Like a hive of bees they flocked intothe house, to the astonishment of two distant aunts, and of several malecousins of Ch'in Chung, all of whom had no time to effect their retreat.
Ch'in Chung had, by this time, had two or three fainting fits, and hadalready long ago been changed his mat. As soon as Pao-y� realised thesituation, he felt unable to repress himself from bursting forth aloud.Li Kuei promptly reasoned with him. "You shouldn't go on in this way,"he urged, "you shouldn't. It's because Mr. Ch'in is so weak that lyingflat on the stove-couch naturally made his bones feel uncomfortable; andthat's why he has temporarily been removed down here to ease him alittle. But if you, sir, go on in this way, will you not, instead ofdoing him any good, aggravate his illness?"
At these words, Pao-y� accordingly restrained himself, and held histongue; and drawing near, he gazed at Ch'in Chung's face, which was aswhite as wax, while with closed eyes, he gasped for breath, rollingabout on his pillow.
"Brother Ching," speedily exclaimed Pao-y�, "Pao-y� is here!" But thoughhe shouted out two or three consecutive times, Ch'in Chung did not heedhim.
"Pao-y� has come!" Pao-y� went on again to cry. But Ch'in Chung's spirithad already departed from his body, leaving behind only a faint breathof superfluous air in his lungs.
He had just caught sight of a number of recording devils, holding awarrant and carrying chains, coming to seize him, but Ch'in Chung's soulwould on no account go along with them; and remembering how that therewas in his home no one to assume the direction of domestic affairs, andfeeling concerned that Chih Neng had as yet no home, he consequentlyused hundreds of arguments in his entreaties to the recording devils;but alas! these devils would, none of them, show him any favour. On thecontrary, they heaped invectives upon Ch'in Chung.
"You're fortunate enough to be a man of letters," they insinuated, "anddon't you know the common saying that: 'if the Prince of Hell call uponyou to die at the third watch, who can presume to retain you, a humanbeing, up to the fifth watch?' In our abode, in the unseen, high as wellas low, have all alike a face made of iron, and heed not selfishmotives; unlike the mortal world, where favouritism and partialityprevail. There exist therefore many difficulties in the way (to ouryielding to your wishes)."
While this fuss was going on, Ch'in Chung's spirit suddenly grasped thefour words, "Pao-y� has come," and without loss of time, it went onagain to make further urgent appeals. "Gentlemen, spiritual deputies,"it exclaimed; "show me a little mercy and allow me to return to makejust one remark to an intimate friend of mine, and I'll be back again."
"What intimate friend is this again?" the devils observed with onevoice.
"I'm not deceiving you, gentlemen," rejoined Ch'in Chung; "it's thegrandson of the duke of Jung Kuo, whose infant name is Pao-y�."
The Decider of life was, at first, upon hearing these words, so seizedwith dismay that he vehemently abused the devils sent on the errand.
"I told you," he shouted, "to let him go back for a turn; but you wouldby no means comply with my words! and now do you wait until he hassummoned a man of glorious fortune and prosperous standing to at lastdesist?"
When the company of devils perceived the manner of the Decider of life,they were all likewise so seized with consternation that they bustledwith hand and feet; while with hearts also full of resentment: "You,sir," they replied, "were at one time such a terror, formidable aslightning; and are you not forsooth able to listen with equanimity tothe two sounds of 'Pao-y�?' our humble idea is that mortal as he is, andimmortal as we are, it wouldn't be to our credit if we feared him!"
But whether Ch'in Chung, after all, died or survived, the next chapterwill explain.

CHAPTER XVII.
  In the Ta Kuan Garden, (Broad Vista,) the merits of Pao-y� are put to      the test, by his being told to write devices for scrolls and      tablets.  Yuan Ch'un returns to the Jung Kuo mansion, on a visit to her parents,      and offers her congratulations to them on the feast of lanterns,      on the fifteenth of the first moon.
Ch'in Chung, to resume our story, departed this life, and Pao-y� went onso unceasingly in his bitter lamentations, that Li Kuei and the otherservants had, for ever so long, an arduous task in trying to comfort himbefore he desisted; but on his return home he was still exceedinglydisconsolate.
Dowager lady Chia afforded monetary assistance to the amount of severaltens of taels; and exclusive of this, she had sacrificial presentslikewise got ready. Pao-y� went and paid a visit of condolence to thefamily, and after seven days the funeral and burial took place, butthere are no particulars about them which could be put on record.
Pao-y�, however, continued to mourn (his friend) from day to day, andwas incessant in his remembrance of him, but there was likewise no helpfor it. Neither is it known after how many days he got over his grief.
On this day, Chia Chen and the others came to tell Chia Cheng that theworks in the garden had all been reported as completed, and that Mr.Chia She had already inspected them. "It only remains," (they said),"for you, sir, to see them; and should there possibly be anything whichis not proper, steps will be at once taken to effect the alterations, sothat the tablets and scrolls may conveniently be written."
After Chia Cheng had listened to these words, he pondered for a while."These tablets and scrolls," he remarked, "present however a difficulttask. According to the rites, we should, in order to obviate anyshortcoming, request the imperial consort to deign and compose them; butif the honourable consort does not gaze upon the scenery with her owneyes, it will also be difficult for her to conceive its nature andindite upon it! And were we to wait until the arrival of her highness,to request her to honour the grounds with a visit, before she composesthe inscriptions, such a wide landscape, with so many pavilions andarbours, will, without one character in the way of a motto, albeit itmay abound with flowers, willows, rockeries, and streams, neverthelessin no way be able to show off its points of beauty to advantage."
The whole party of family companions, who stood by, smiled. "Your views,remarkable sir," they ventured, "are excellent; but we have now aproposal to make. Tablets and scrolls for every locality cannot, on anyaccount, be dispensed with, but they could not likewise, by any means,be determined upon for good! Were now, for the time being, two, three orfour characters fixed upon, harmonising with the scenery, to carry out,for form's sake, the idea, and were they provisionally utilised asmottoes for the lanterns, tablets and scrolls, and hung up, pending thearrival of her highness, and her visit through the grounds, when shecould be requested to decide upon the devices, would not two exigenciesbe met with satisfactorily?"
"Your views are perfectly correct," observed Chia Cheng, after he hadheard their suggestion; "and we should go to-day and have a look at theplace so as then to set to work to write the inscriptions; which, ifsuitable, can readily be used; and, if unsuitable, Y�-ts'un can then besent for, and asked to compose fresh ones."
The whole company smiled. "If you, sir, were to compose them to-day,"they ventured, "they are sure to be excellent; and what need will therebe again to wait for Y�-ts'un!"
"You people are not aware," Chia Cheng added with a smiling countenance,"that I've been, even in my young days, very mediocre in the compositionof stanzas on flowers, birds, rockeries and streams; and that now thatI'm well up in years and have moreover the fatigue and trouble of myofficial duties, I've become in literary compositions like these, whichrequire a light heart and gladsome mood, still more inapt. Were I evento succeed in composing any, they will unavoidably be so doltish andforced that they would contrariwise be instrumental in making theflowers, trees, garden and pavilions, through their demerits, lose inbeauty, and present instead no pleasing feature."
"This wouldn't anyhow matter," remonstrated all the family companions,"for after perusing them we can all decide upon them together, each oneof us recommending those he thinks best; which if excellent can be kept,and if faulty can be discarded; and there's nothing unfeasible aboutthis!"
"This proposal is most apposite," rejoined Chia Cheng. "What's more, theweather is, I rejoice, fine to-day; so let's all go in a company andhave a look."
Saying this, he stood up and went forward, at the head of the wholeparty; while Chia Chen betook himself in advance into the garden to letevery one know of their coming. As luck would have it, Pao-y�--for hehad been these last few days thinking of Ch'in Chung and so ceaselesslysad and wounded at heart, that dowager lady Chia had frequently directedthe servants to take him into the new garden to play--made his entrancejust at this very time, and suddenly became aware of the arrival of ChiaChen, who said to him with a smile, "Don't you yet run away as fast asyou can? Mr. Chia Cheng will be coming in a while."
At these words, Pao-y� led off his nurse and the youths, and rushed atonce out of the garden, like a streak of smoke; but as he turned acorner, he came face to face with Chia Cheng, who was advancing towardsthat direction, at the head of all the visitors; and as he had no timeto get out of the way, the only course open to him was to stand on oneside.
Chia Cheng had, of late, heard the tutor extol him by saying that hedisplayed special ability in rhyming antithetical lines, and thatalthough he did not like to read his books, he nevertheless possessedsome depraved talents, and hence it was that he was induced at thismoment to promptly bid him follow him into the garden, with the intentof putting him to the test.
Pao-y� could not make out what his object was, but he was compelled tofollow. As soon as they reached the garden gate, and he caught sight ofChia Chen, standing on one side, along with several managers: "See thatthe garden gate is closed for a time," Chia Cheng exclaimed, "for we'llfirst see the outside and then go in."
Chia Chen directed a servant to close the gate, and Chia Cheng firstlooked straight ahead of him towards the gate and espied on the sameside as the main entrance a suite of five apartments. Above, thecylindrical tiles resembled the backs of mud eels. The doors, railings,windows, and frames were all finely carved with designs of the newfashion, and were painted neither in vermilion nor in white colours. Thewhole extent of the walls was of polished bricks of uniform colour;while below, the white marble on the terrace and steps was engraved withwestern foreign designs; and when he came to look to the right and tothe left, everything was white as snow. At the foot of the white-washedwalls, tiger-skin pebbles were, without regard to pattern, promiscuouslyinserted in the earth in such a way as of their own selves to formstreaks. Nothing fell in with the custom of gaudiness and display somuch in vogue, so that he naturally felt full of delight; and, when heforthwith asked that the gate should be thrown open, all that met theireyes was a long stretch of verdant hills, which shut in the view infront of them.
"What a fine hill, what a pretty hill!" exclaimed all the companionswith one voice.
"Were it not for this one hill," Chia Cheng explained, "whatever sceneryis contained in it would clearly strike the eye, as soon as one enteredinto the garden, and what pleasure would that have been?"
"Quite so," rejoined all of them. "But without large hills and ravinesin one's breast (liberal capacities), how could one attain suchimagination!"
After the conclusion of this remark, they cast a glance ahead of them,and perceived white rugged rocks looking, either like goblins, orresembling savage beasts, lying either crossways, or in horizontal orupright positions; on the surface of which grew moss and lichen withmottled hues, or parasitic plants, which screened off the light; while,slightly visible, wound, among the rocks, a narrow pathway like theintestines of a sheep.
"If we were now to go and stroll along by this narrow path," Chia Chengsuggested, "and to come out from over there on our return, we shall havebeen able to see the whole grounds."
Having finished speaking, he asked Chia Chen to lead the way; and hehimself, leaning on Pao-y�, walked into the gorge with leisurely step.Raising his head, he suddenly beheld on the hill a block of stone, aswhite as the surface of a looking-glass, in a site which was, in verydeed, suitable to be left for an inscription, as it was bound to meetthe eye.
"Gentlemen," Chia Cheng observed, as he turned his head round andsmiled, "please look at this spot. What name will it be fit to give it?"
When the company heard his remark, some maintained that the two words"Heaped verdure" should be written; and others upheld that the deviceshould be "Embroidered Hill." Others again suggested: "Vying with theHsiang Lu;" and others recommended "the small Chung Nan." And variouskinds of names were proposed, which did not fall short of several tens.
All the visitors had been, it must be explained, aware at an earlyperiod of the fact that Chia Cheng meant to put Pao-y�'s ability to thetest, and for this reason they merely proposed a few combinations incommon use. But of this intention, Pao-y� himself was likewisecognizant.
After listening to the suggestions, Chia Cheng forthwith turned his headround and bade Pao-y� think of some motto.
"I've often heard," Pao-y� replied, "that writers of old opine that it'sbetter to quote an old saying than to compose a new one; and that an oldengraving excels in every respect an engraving of the present day.What's more, this place doesn't constitute the main hill or the chieffeature of the scenery, and is really no site where any inscriptionshould be put, as it no more than constitutes the first step in theinspection of the landscape. Won't it be well to employ the exact textof an old writer consisting of 'a tortuous path leading to a secluded(nook).' This line of past days would, if inscribed, be, in fact,liberal to boot."
After listening to the proposed line, they all sang its praise."First-rate! excellent!" they cried, "the natural talents of your secondson, dear friend, are lofty; his mental capacity is astute; he is unlikeourselves, who have read books but are simple fools."
"You shouldn't," urged Chia Cheng smilingly, "heap upon him excessivepraise; he's young in years, and merely knows one thing which he turnsto the use of ten purposes; you should laugh at him, that's all; but wecan by and by choose some device."
As he spoke, he entered the cave, where he perceived beautiful treeswith thick foliage, quaint flowers in lustrous bloom, while a line oflimpid stream emanated out of a deep recess among the flowers and trees,and oozed down through the crevice of the rock. Progressing severalsteps further in, they gradually faced the northern side, where astretch of level ground extended far and wide, on each side of whichsoared lofty buildings, intruding themselves into the skies, whosecarved rafters and engraved balustrades nestled entirely among thedepressions of the hills and the tops of the trees. They lowered theireyes and looked, and beheld a pure stream flowing like jade, stone stepstraversing the clouds, a balustrade of white marble encircling the pondin its embrace, and a stone bridge with three archways, the animals uponwhich had faces disgorging water from their mouths. A pavilion stood onthe bridge, and in this pavilion Chia Chen and the whole party went andsat.
"Gentlemen," he inquired, "what shall we write about this?"
"In the record," they all replied, "of the 'Drunken Old Man's Pavilion,'written in days of old by Ou Yang, appears this line: 'There is apavilion pinioned-like,' so let us call this 'the pinioned-likepavilion,' and finish."
"Pinioned-like," observed Chia Cheng smiling, "is indeed excellent; butthis pavilion is constructed over the water, and there should, afterall, be some allusion to the water in the designation. My humble opinionis that of the line in Ou Yang's work, '(the water) drips from betweenthe two peaks,' we should only make use of that single word 'drips.'"
"First-rate!" rejoined one of the visitors, "capital! but what wouldreally be appropriate are the two characters 'dripping jadelike.'"
Chia Chen pulled at his moustache, as he gave way to reflection; afterwhich, he asked Pao-y� to also propose one himself.
"What you, sir, suggested a while back," replied Pao-y�, "will do verywell; but if we were now to sift the matter thoroughly, the use of thesingle word 'drip' by Ou Yang, in his composition about the Niangspring, would appear quite apposite; while the application, also on thisoccasion, to this spring, of the character 'drip' would be found notquite suitable. Moreover, seeing that this place is intended as aseparate residence (for the imperial consort), on her visit to herparents, it is likewise imperative that we should comply with all theprinciples of etiquette, so that were words of this kind to be used,they would besides be coarse and inappropriate; and may it please you tofix upon something else more recondite and abstruse."
"What do you, gentlemen, think of this argument?" Chia Cheng remarkedsneeringly. "A little while ago, when the whole company devisedsomething original, you observed that it would be better to quote an olddevice; and now that we have quoted an old motto, you again maintainthat it's coarse and inappropriate! But you had better give us one ofyours."
"If two characters like 'dripping jadelike' are to be used," Pao-y�explained, "it would be better then to employ the two words 'PenetratingFragrance,' which would be unique and excellent, wouldn't they?"
Chia Cheng pulled his moustache, nodded his head and did not utter aword; whereupon the whole party hastily pressed forward with one voiceto eulogize Pao-y�'s acquirements as extraordinary.
"The selection of two characters for the tablet is an easy matter,"suggested Chia Cheng, "but now go on and compose a pair of antitheticalphrases with seven words in each."
Pao-y� cast a glance round the four quarters, when an idea came into hishead, and he went on to recite:
  The willows, which enclose the shore, the green borrow from three      bamboos;  On banks apart, the flowers asunder grow, yet one perfume they give.
Upon hearing these lines, Chia Cheng gave a faint smile, as he noddedhis head, whilst the whole party went on again to be effusive in theirpraise. But forthwith they issued from the pavilions, and crossed thepond, contemplating with close attention each elevation, each stone,each flower, or each tree. And as suddenly they raised their heads, theycaught sight, in front of them, of a line of white wall, of numbers ofcolumns, and beautiful cottages, where flourished hundreds and thousandsof verdant bamboos, which screened off the rays of the sun.
"What a lovely place!" they one and all exclaimed.
Speedily the whole company penetrated inside, perceiving, as soon asthey had entered the gate, a zigzag arcade, below the steps of which wasa raised pathway, laid promiscuously with stones, and on the furthestpart stood a diminutive cottage with three rooms, two with doors leadinginto them and one without. Everything in the interior, in the shape ofbeds, teapoys, chairs and tables, were made to harmonise with the spaceavailable. Leading out of the inner room of the cottage was a small doorfrom which, as they egressed, they found a back-court with lofty peartrees in blossom and banana trees, as well as two very small retiringback-courts. At the foot of the wall, unexpectedly became visible anaperture where was a spring, for which a channel had been openedscarcely a foot or so wide, to enable it to run inside the wall. Windinground the steps, it skirted the buildings until it reached the frontcourt, where it coiled and curved, flowing out under the bamboos.
"This spot," observed Chia Cheng full of smiles, "is indeed pleasant!and could one, on a moonlight night, sit under the window and study, onewould not spend a whole lifetime in vain!"
As he said this, he quickly cast a glance at Pao-y�, and so terrifieddid Pao-y� feel that he hastily drooped his head. The whole company lostno time in choosing some irrelevant talk to turn the conversation, andtwo of the visitors prosecuted their remarks by adding that on thetablet, in this spot, four characters should be inscribed.
"Which four characters?" Chia Cheng inquired, laughingly.
"The bequeathed aspect of the river Ch'i!" suggested one of them.
"It's commonplace," observed Chia Cheng.
Another person recommended "the remaining vestiges of the Ch� Garden."
"This too is commonplace!" replied Chia Cheng.
"Let brother Pao-y� again propound one!" interposed Chia Chen, who stoodby.
"Before he composes any himself," Chia Cheng continued, "his wont is tofirst discuss the pros and cons of those of others; so it's evident thathe's an impudent fellow!"
"He's most reasonable in his arguments," all the visitors protested,"and why should he be called to task?"
"Don't humour him so much!" Chia Cheng expostulated. "I'll put up forto-day," he however felt constrained to tell Pao-y�, "with your haughtymanner, and your rubbishy speech, so that after you have, to begin with,given us your opinion, you may next compose a device. But tell me, arethere any that will do among the mottoes suggested just now by all thegentlemen?"
"They all seem to me unsuitable!" Pao-y� did not hesitate to say by wayof reply to this question.
Chia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. "How all unsuitable?" he exclaimed.
"This," continued Pao-y�, "is the first spot which her highness willhonour on her way, and there should be inscribed, so that it should beappropriate, something commending her sacred majesty. But if a tabletwith four characters has to be used, there are likewise devices ready athand, written by poets of old; and what need is there to compose anymore?"
"Are forsooth the devices 'the river Ch'i and the Chu Garden' not thoseof old authors?" insinuated Chia Cheng.
"They are too stiff," replied Pao-y�. "Would not the four characters: 'aphoenix comes with dignified air,' be better?"
With clamorous unanimity the whole party shouted: "Excellent:" and ChiaCheng nodding his head; "You beast, you beast!" he ejaculated, "it maywell be said about you that you see through a thin tube and have no morejudgment than an insect! Compose another stanza," he consequently badehim; and Pao-y� recited:
  In the precious tripod kettle, tea is brewed, but green is still the      smoke!  O'er is the game of chess by the still window, but the fingers are yet      cold.
Chia Cheng shook his head. "Neither does this seem to me good!" he said;and having concluded this remark he was leading the company out, whenjust as he was about to proceed, he suddenly bethought himself ofsomething.
"The several courts and buildings and the teapoys, sideboards, tablesand chairs," he added, "may be said to be provided for. But there arestill all those curtains, screens and portieres, as well as thefurniture, nicknacks and curios; and have they too all been matched tosuit the requirements of each place?"
"Of the things that have to be placed about," Chia Chen explained, agood number have, at an early period, been added, and of course when thetime comes everything will be suitably arranged. As for the curtains,screens, and portieres, which have to be hung up, I heard yesterdaybrother Lien say that they are not as yet complete, that when the workswere first taken in hand, the plan of each place was drawn, themeasurements accurately calculated and some one despatched to attend tothe things, and that he thought that yesterday half of them were boundto come in.
Chia Cheng, upon hearing this explanation, readily remembered that withall these concerns Chia Chen had nothing to do; so that he speedily sentsome one to go and call Chia Lien.
Having arrived in a short while, "How many sorts of things are there inall?" Chia Cheng inquired of him. "Of these how many kinds have by thistime been got ready? and how many more are short?"
At this question, Chia Lien hastily produced, from the flaps of hisboot, a paper pocket-book, containing a list, which he kept inside thetops of his boot. After perusing it and reperusing it, he made suitablereply. "Of the hundred and twenty curtains," he proceeded, "of stiffspotted silks, embroidered with dragons in relief, and of the curtainslarge and small, of every kind of damask silk, eighty were gotyesterday, so that there still remain forty of them to come. The twoportieres were both received yesterday; and besides these, there are thetwo hundred red woollen portieres, two hundred portieres of Hsiang Feibamboo; two hundred door-screens of rattan, with gold streaks, and ofred lacquered bamboo; two hundred portieres of black lacquered rattan;two hundred door-screens of variegated thread-netting with clusters offlowers. Of each of these kinds, half have come in, but the whole lot ofthem will be complete no later than autumn. Antimacassars, table-cloths,flounces for the beds, and cushions for the stools, there are a thousandtwo hundred of each, but these likewise are ready and at hand."
As he spoke, they proceeded outwards, but suddenly they perceived a hillextending obliquely in such a way as to intercept the passage; and asthey wound round the curve of the hill faintly came to view a line ofyellow mud walls, the whole length of which was covered with paddystalks for the sake of protection, and there were several hundreds ofapricot trees in bloom, which presented the appearance of being fire,spurted from the mouth, or russet clouds, rising in the air. Inside thisenclosure, stood several thatched cottages. Outside grew, on the otherhand, mulberry trees, elms, mallows, and silkworm oaks, whose tendershoots and new twigs, of every hue, were allowed to bend and tointertwine in such a way as to form two rows of green fence. Beyond thisfence and below the white mound, was a well, by the side of which stooda well-sweep, windlass and such like articles; the ground further downbeing divided into parcels, and apportioned into fields, which, with thefine vegetables and cabbages in flower, presented, at the first glance,the aspect of being illimitable.
"This is," Chia Cheng observed chuckling, "the place really imbued witha certain amount of the right principle; and laid out, though it hasbeen by human labour, yet when it strikes my eye, it so moves my heart,that it cannot help arousing in me the wish to return to my native placeand become a farmer. But let us enter and rest a while."
As he concluded these words, they were on the point of walking in, whenthey unexpectedly discerned a stone, outside the trellis gate, by theroadside, which had also been left as a place on which to inscribe amotto.
"Were a tablet," argued the whole company smilingly, "put up high in aspot like this, to be filled up by and by, the rustic aspect of a farmwould in that case be completely done away with; and it will be better,yea far better to erect this slab on the ground, as it will further makemanifest many points of beauty. But unless a motto could be composed ofthe same excellence as that in Fan Shih-hu's song on farms, it will notbe adequate to express its charms!"
"Gentlemen," observed Chia Cheng, "please suggest something."
"A short while back," replied the whole company, "your son, venerablebrother, remarked that devising a new motto was not equal to quoting anold one, and as sites of this kind have been already exhausted bywriters of days of old, wouldn't it be as well that we shouldstraightway call it the 'apricot blossom village?' and this will dosplendidly."
When Chia Cheng heard this remark, he smiled and said, addressinghimself to Chia Chen: "This just reminds me that although this place isperfect in every respect, there's still one thing wanting in the shapeof a wine board; and you had better then have one made to-morrow on thevery same pattern as those used outside in villages; and it needn't beanything gaudy, but hung above the top of a tree by means of bamboos."
Chia Chen assented. "There's no necessity," he went on to explain, "tokeep any other birds in here, but only to rear a few geese, ducks, fowlsand such like; as in that case they will be in perfect keeping with theplace."
"A splendid idea!" Chia Cheng rejoined, along with all the party.
"'Apricot blossom village' is really first-rate," continued Chia Chengas he again addressed himself to the company; "but the only thing isthat it encroaches on the real designation of the village; and it willbe as well to wait (until her highness comes), when we can request herto give it a name."
"Certainly!" answered the visitors with one voice; "but now as far as aname goes, for mere form, let us all consider what expressions will besuitable to employ."
Pao-y� did not however give them time to think; nor did he wait for ChiaCheng's permission, but suggested there and then: "In old poetical worksthere's this passage: 'At the top of the red apricot tree hangs the flagof an inn,' and wouldn't it be advisable, on this occasion, totemporarily adopt the four words: 'the sign on the apricot tree isvisible'?"
"'Is visible' is excellent," suggested the whole number of them, "andwhat's more it secretly accords with the meaning implied by 'apricotblossom village.'"
"Were the two words 'apricot blossom' used for the name of the village,they would be too commonplace and unsuitable;" added Pao-y� with asardonic grin, "but there's another passage in the works of a poet ofthe T'ang era: 'By the wooden gate near the water the corn-flower emitsits fragrance;' and why not make use of the motto 'corn fragrancevillage,' which will be excellent?"
When the company heard his proposal, they, with still greater vigour,unanimously combined in crying out "Capital!" as they clapped theirhands.
Chia Cheng, with one shout, interrupted their cries, "You ignorant childof wrath!" he ejaculated; "how many old writers can you know, and howmany stanzas of ancient poetical works can you remember, that you willhave the boldness to show off in the presence of all these experiencedgentlemen? (In allowing you to give vent to) all the nonsense youuttered my object was no other than to see whether your brain was clearor muddled; and all for fun's sake, that's all; and lo, you've takenthings in real earnest!"
Saying this, he led the company into the interior of the hall with themallows. The windows were pasted with paper, and the bedsteads made ofwood, and all appearance of finery had been expunged, and Chia Cheng'sheart was naturally much gratified; but nevertheless, scowling angrilyat Pao-y�, "What do you think of this place?" he asked.
When the party heard this question, they all hastened to stealthily givea nudge to Pao-y�, with the express purpose of inducing him to say itwas nice; but Pao-y� gave no ear to what they all urged. "It's by farbelow the spot," he readily replied, "designated 'a phoenix comes withdignified air.'"
"You ignorant stupid thing!" exclaimed Chia Cheng at these words; "whatyou simply fancy as exquisite, with that despicable reliance of yoursupon luxury and display, are two-storied buildings and painted pillars!But how can you know anything about this aspect so pure and unobtrusive,and this is all because of that failing of not studying your books!"
"Sir," hastily answered Pao-y�, "your injunctions are certainly correct;but men of old have often made allusion to 'natural;' and what is, Iwonder, the import of these two characters?"
The company had perceived what a perverse mind Pao y� possessed, andthey one and all were much surprised that he should be so silly beyondthe possibility of any change; and when now they heard the question heasked, about the two characters representing "natural," they, with oneaccord, speedily remarked, "Everything else you understand, and how isit that on the contrary you don't know what 'natural' implies? The word'natural' means effected by heaven itself and not made by human labour."
"Well, just so," rejoined Pao-y�; "but the farm, which is laid out inthis locality, is distinctly the handiwork of human labour; in thedistance, there are no neighbouring hamlets; near it, adjoin no wastes;though it bears a hill, the hill is destitute of streaks; though it beclose to water, this water has no spring; above, there is no pagodanestling in a temple; below, there is no bridge leading to a market; itrises abrupt and solitary, and presents no grand sight! The palm wouldseem to be carried by the former spot, which is imbued with the naturalprinciple, and possesses the charms of nature; for, though bamboos havebeen planted in it, and streams introduced, they nevertheless do noviolence to the works executed. 'A natural landscape,' says, an ancientauthor in four words; and why? Simply because he apprehended that whatwas not land, would, by forcible ways, be converted into land; and thatwhat was no hill would, by unnatural means, be raised into a hill. Andingenious though these works might be in a hundred and one ways, theycannot, after all, be in harmony."...
But he had no time to conclude, as Chia Cheng flew into a rage. "Drivehim off," he shouted; (but as Pao-y�) was on the point of going out, heagain cried out: "Come back! make up," he added, "another couplet, andif it isn't clear, I'll for all this give you a slap on your mouth."
Pao-y� had no alternative but to recite as follows:
  A spot in which the "Ko" fibre to bleach, as the fresh tide doth swell      the waters green!  A beauteous halo and a fragrant smell the man encompass who the cress      did pluck!
Chia Cheng, after this recital, nodded his head. "This is still worse!"he remarked, but as he reproved him, he led the company outside, andwinding past the mound, they penetrated among flowers, and wending theirsteps by the willows, they touched the rocks and lingered by the stream.Passing under the trellis with yellow roses, they went into the shedwith white roses; they crossed by the pavilion with peonies, and walkedthrough the garden, where the white peony grew; and entering the courtwith the cinnamon roses, they reached the island of bananas. As theymeandered and zigzagged, suddenly they heard the rustling sound of thewater, as it came out from a stone cave, from the top of which grewparasitic plants drooping downwards, while at its bottom floated thefallen flowers.
"What a fine sight!" they all exclaimed; "what beautiful scenery!"
"Gentlemen," observed Chia Cheng, "what name do you propose for thisplace?"
"There's no further need for deliberation," the company rejoined; "forthis is just the very spot fit for the three words 'Wu Ling Spring.'"
"This too is matter-of-fact!" Chia Cheng objected laughingly, "andlikewise antiquated."
"If that won't do," the party smiled, "well then what about the fourcharacters implying 'An old cottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty?'"
"This is still more exceedingly plain!" interposed Pao-y�. "'The oldcottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty' is meant to imply a retreat fromrevolution, and how will it suit this place? Wouldn't the fourcharacters be better denoting 'an isthmus with smart weed, and a streamwith flowers'?"
When Chia Cheng heard these words, he exclaimed: "You're talking stillmore stuff and nonsense?" and forthwith entering the grotto, Chia Chengwent on to ask of Chia Chen, "Are there any boats or not?"
"There are to be," replied Chia Chen, "four boats in all from which topick the lotus, and one boat for sitting in; but they haven't now as yetbeen completed."
"What a pity!" Chia Cheng answered smilingly, "that we cannot go in."
"But we could also get into it by the tortuous path up the hill," ChiaChen ventured; and after finishing this remark, he walked ahead to showthe way, and the whole party went over, holding on to the creepers, andsupporting themselves by the trees, when they saw a still largerquantity of fallen leaves on the surface of the water, and the streamitself, still more limpid, gently and idly meandering along on itscircuitous course. By the bank of the pond were two rows of weepingwillows, which, intermingling with peach and apricot trees, screened theheavens from view, and kept off the rays of the sun from this spot,which was in real truth devoid of even a grain of dust.
Suddenly, they espied in the shade of the willows, an arched woodenbridge also reveal itself to the eye, with bannisters of vermilioncolour. They crossed the bridge, and lo, all the paths lay open beforethem; but their gaze was readily attracted by a brick cottage spotlessand cool-looking; whose walls were constructed of polished bricks, ofuniform colour; (whose roof was laid) with speckless tiles; and whoseenclosing walls were painted; while the minor slopes, which branched offfrom the main hill, all passed along under the walls on to the otherside.
"This house, in a site like this, is perfectly destitute of any charm!"added Chia Cheng.
And as they entered the door, abruptly appeared facing them, a largeboulder studded with holes and soaring high in the skies, which wassurrounded on all four sides by rocks of every description, andcompletely, in fact, hid from view the rooms situated in the compound.But of flowers or trees, there was not even one about; and all that wasvisible were a few strange kinds of vegetation; some being of thecreeper genus, others parasitic plants, either hanging from the apex ofthe hill, or inserting themselves into the base of the rocks; droopingdown even from the eaves of the house, entwining the pillars, andclosing round the stone steps. Or like green bands, they waved andflapped; or like gold thread, they coiled and bent, either with seedsresembling cinnabar, or with blossoms like golden olea; whose fragranceand aroma could not be equalled by those emitted by flowers of ordinaryspecies.
"This is pleasant!" Chia Cheng could not refrain from saying; "the onlything is that I don't know very much about flowers."
"What are here are lianas and ficus pumila!" some of the companyobserved.
"How ever can the liana and the ficus have such unusual scent?"questioned Chia Cheng.
"Indeed they aren't!" interposed Pao-y�. "Among all these flowers, thereare also ficus and liana, but those scented ones are iris, ligularia,and 'Wu' flowers; that kind consist, for the most part, of 'Ch'ih'flowers and orchids; while this mostly of gold-coloured dolichos. Thatspecies is the hypericum plant, this the 'Y� Lu' creeper. The red onesare, of course, the purple rue; the green ones consist for certain, ofthe green 'Chih' plant; and, to the best of my belief, these variousplants are mentioned in the 'Li Sao' and 'Wen Hsuan.' These rare plantsare, some of them called something or other like 'Huo Na' and 'ChiangHui;' others again are designated something like 'Lun Tsu' and 'Tz'uFeng;' while others there are whose names sound like 'Shih Fan,' 'ShuiSung' and 'Fu Liu,' which together with other species are to be found inthe 'Treatise about the Wu city' by Tso T'ai-chung. There are also thosewhich go under the appellation of 'Lu T'i,' or something like that;while there are others that are called something or other like 'TanChiao,' 'Mi Wu' and 'Feng Lien;' reference to which is made in the'Treatise on the Shu city.' But so many years have now elapsed, and thetimes have so changed (since these treatises were written), that people,being unable to discriminate (the real names) may consequently have hadto appropriate in every case such names as suited the external aspect,so that they may, it is quite possible, have gradually come to be calledby wrong designations."
But he had no time to conclude; for Chia Cheng interrupted him. "Who hasever asked you about it?" he shouted; which plunged Pao-y� into such afright, that he drew back, and did not venture to utter another word.
Chia Cheng perceiving that on both sides alike were covered passagesresembling outstretched arms, forthwith continued his steps and enteredthe covered way, when he caught sight, at the upper end, of afive-roomed building, without spot or blemish, with folding blindsextending in a connected line, and with corridors on all four sides; (abuilding) which with its windows so green, and its painted walls,excelled, in spotless elegance, the other buildings they had seenbefore, to which it presented such a contrast.
Chia Cheng heaved a sigh. "If one were able," he observed, "to boil histea and thrum his lyre in here, there wouldn't even be any need for himto burn any more incense. But the execution of this structure is sobeyond conception that you must, gentlemen, compose something nice andoriginal to embellish the tablet with, so as not to render such a placeof no effect!"
"There's nothing so really pat," suggested the company smiling; "as 'theorchid-smell-laden breeze' and 'the dew-bedecked epidendrum!"
"These are indeed the only four characters," rejoined Chia Cheng, "thatcould be suitably used; but what's to be said as far as the scrollgoes?"
"I've thought of a couplet," interposed one of the party, "which you'llall have to criticise, and put into ship-shape; its burden is this:
 "The musk-like epidendrum smell enshrouds the court, where shines the      sun with oblique beams;  The iris fragrance is wafted over the isle illumined by the moon's      clear rays."
"As far as excellence is concerned, it's excellent," observed the wholeparty, "but the two words representing 'with oblique beams' are notfelicitous."
And as some one quoted the line from an old poem:
  The angelica fills the court with tears, what time the sun doth slant.
"Lugubrious, lugubrious!" expostulated the company with one voice.
Another person then interposed. "I also have a couplet, whose meritsyou, gentlemen, can weigh; it runs as follows:
 "Along the three pathways doth float the Y� Hui scented breeze!  The radiant moon in the whole hall shines on the gold orchid!"
Chia Cheng tugged at his moustache and gave way to meditation. He wasjust about also to suggest a stanza, when, upon suddenly raising hishead, he espied Pao-y� standing by his side, too timid to give vent to asingle sound.
"How is it," he purposely exclaimed, "that when you should speak, youcontrariwise don't? Is it likely that you expect some one to request youto confer upon us the favour of your instruction?"
"In this place," Pao-y� rejoined at these words, "there are no suchthings as orchids, musk, resplendent moon or islands; and were one tobegin quoting such specimens of allusions, to scenery, two hundredcouplets could be readily given without, even then, having been able toexhaust the supply!"
"Who presses your head down," Chia Cheng urged, "and uses force that youmust come out with all these remarks?"
"Well, in that case," added Pao-y�, "there are no fitter words to put onthe tablet than the four representing: 'The fragrance pure of theligularia and iris.' While the device on the scroll might be:
 "Sung is the nutmeg song, but beauteous still is the sonnet!  Near the T'u Mei to sleep, makes e'en a dream with fragrance full!"
"This is," laughed Chia Cheng sneeringly, "an imitation of the line:
 "A book when it is made of plaintain leaves, the writing green is also      bound to be!
"So that there's nothing remarkable about it."
"Li T'ai-po, in his work on the Phoenix Terrace," protested the wholeparty, "copied, in every point, the Huang Hua Lou. But what's essentialis a faultless imitation. Now were we to begin to criticise minutely thecouplet just cited, we would indeed find it to be, as compared with theline 'A book when it is made of plantain leaves,' still more elegant andof wider application!"
"What an idea?" observed Chia Cheng derisively.
But as he spoke, the whole party walked out; but they had not gone veryfar before they caught sight of a majestic summer house, towering highpeak-like, and of a structure rising loftily with storey upon storey;and completely locked in as they were on every side they were asbeautiful as the Jade palace. Far and wide, road upon road coiled andwound; while the green pines swept the eaves, the jady epidendrumencompassed the steps, the animals' faces glistened like gold, and thedragons' heads shone resplendent in their variegated hues.
"This is the Main Hall," remarked Chia Cheng; "the only word against itis that there's a little too much finery."
"It should be so," rejoined one and all, "so as to be what it's intendedto be! The imperial consort has, it is true, an exalted preference foreconomy and frugality, but her present honourable position requires theobservance of such courtesies, so that (finery) is no fault."
As they made these remarks and advanced on their way the while, theyperceived, just in front of them, an archway project to view,constructed of jadelike stone; at the top of which the coils of largedragons and the scales of small dragons were executed in perforatedstyle.
"What's the device to be for this spot?" inquired Chia Cheng.
"It should be 'fairy land,'" suggested all of them, "so as to beapposite!"
Chia Cheng nodded his head and said nothing. But as soon as Pao-y�caught sight of this spot something was suddenly aroused in his heartand he began to ponder within himself. "This place really resemblessomething that I've seen somewhere or other." But he could not at themoment recall to mind what year, moon, or day this had happened.
Chia Cheng bade him again propose a motto; but Pao-y� was bent uponthinking over the details of the scenery he had seen on a formeroccasion, and gave no thought whatever to this place, so that the wholecompany were at a loss what construction to give to his silence, andcame simply to the conclusion that, after the bullying he had had to putup with for ever so long, his spirits had completely vanished, histalents become exhausted and his speech impoverished; and that if hewere harassed and pressed, he might perchance, as the result of anxiety,contract some ailment or other, which would of course not be a suitableissue, and they lost no time in combining together to dissuade ChiaCheng.
"Never mind," they said, "to-morrow will do to compose some device;let's drop it now."
Chia Cheng himself was inwardly afraid lest dowager lady Chia should beanxious, so that he hastily remarked as he forced a smile. "You beast,there are, after all, also occasions on which you are no good! but nevermind! I'll give you one day to do it in, and if by to-morrow you haven'tbeen able to compose anything, I shall certainly not let you off. Thisis the first and foremost place and you must exercise due care in whatyou write."
Saying this, he sallied out, at the head of the company, and castanother glance at the scenery.
Indeed from the time they had entered the gate up to this stage, theyhad just gone over five or six tenths of the whole ground, when ithappened again that a servant came and reported that some one hadarrived from Mr. Y�-'ts'un's to deliver a message. "These several places(which remain)," Chia Cheng observed with a smile, "we have no time topass under inspection; but we might as well nevertheless go out at leastby that way, as we shall be able, to a certain degree, to have a look atthe general aspect."
With these words, he showed the way for the family companions until theyreached a large bridge, with water entering under it, looking like acurtain made of crystal. This bridge, the fact is, was the dam, whichcommunicated with the river outside, and from which the stream wasintroduced into the grounds.
"What's the name of this water-gate?" Chia Cheng inquired.
"This is," replied Pao-y�, "the main stream of the Hsin Fang river, andis therefore called the Hsin Fang water-gate."
"Nonsense!" exclaimed Chia Cheng. "The two words Hsin Fang must on noaccount be used!"
And as they speedily advanced on their way, they either came acrosselegant halls, or thatched cottages; walls made of piled-up stone, orgates fashioned of twisted plants; either a secluded nunnery or Buddhistfane, at the foot of some hill; or some unsullied houses, hidden in agrove, tenanted by rationalistic priestesses; either extensive corridorsand winding grottoes; or square buildings, and circular pavilions. ButChia Cheng had not the energy to enter any of these places, for as hehad not had any rest for ever so long, his legs felt shaky and his feetweak.
Suddenly they also discerned ahead of them a court disclose itself toview.
"When we get there," Chia Cheng suggested, "we must have a little rest."Straightway as he uttered the remark, he led them in, and winding roundthe jade-green peach-trees, covered with blossom, they passed throughthe bamboo fence and flower-laden hedge, which were twisted in such away as to form a circular, cavelike gateway, when unexpectedly appearedbefore their eyes an enclosure with whitewashed walls, in which verdantwillows drooped in every direction.
Chia Cheng entered the gateway in company with the whole party. Alongthe whole length of both sides extended covered passages, connected witheach other; while in the court were laid out several rockeries. In onequarter were planted a number of banana trees; on the opposite stood aplant of begonia from Hsi Fu. Its appearance was like an open umbrella.The gossamer hanging (from its branches) resembled golden threads. Thecorollas (seemed) to spurt out cinnabar.
"What a beautiful flower! what a beautiful flower!" ejaculated the wholeparty with one voice; "begonias are verily to be found; but never beforehave we seen anything the like of this in beauty."
"This is called the maiden begonia and is, in fact, a foreign species,"Chia Cheng observed. "There's a homely tradition that it is because itemanates from the maiden kingdom that its flowers are most prolific; butthis is likewise erratic talk and devoid of common sense."
"They are, after all," rejoined the whole company, "so unlike others (wehave seen), that what's said about the maiden kingdom is, we areinclined to believe, possibly a fact."
"I presume," interposed Pao-y�, "that some clever bard or poet,(perceiving) that this flower was red like cosmetic, delicate as ifpropped up in sickness, and that it closely resembled the nature of ayoung lady, gave it, consequently, the name of maiden! People in theworld will propagate idle tales, all of which are unavoidably treated asgospel!"
"We receive (with thanks) your instructions; what excellentexplanation!" they all remarked unanimously, and as they expressed thesewords, the whole company took their seats on the sofas under thecolonnade.
"Let's think of some original text or other for a motto," Chia Chenghaving suggested, one of the companions opined that the two characters:"Banana and stork" would be felicitous; while another one was of theidea that what would be faultless would be: "Collected splendour andwaving elegance!"
"'Collected splendour and waving elegance' is excellent," Chia Chengobserved addressing himself to the party; and Pao-y� himself, while alsoextolling it as beautiful, went on to say: "There's only one thinghowever to be regretted!"
"What about regret?" the company inquired.
"In this place," Pao-y� explained, "are set out both bananas as well asbegonias, with the intent of secretly combining in them the twoproperties of red and green; and if mention of one of them be made, andthe other be omitted, (the device) won't be good enough for selection."
"What would you then suggest?" Chia Cheng asked.
"I would submit the four words, 'the red (flowers) are fragrant, thegreen (banana leaves) like jade,' which would render complete thebeauties of both (the begonias and bananas)."
"It isn't good! it isn't good!" Chia Cheng remonstrated as he shook hishead; and while passing this remark, he conducted the party into thehouse, where they noticed that the internal arrangements effecteddiffered from those in other places, as no partitions could, in fact, bediscerned. Indeed, the four sides were all alike covered with boardscarved hollow with fretwork, (in designs consisting) either of rollingclouds and hundreds of bats; or of the three friends of the cold seasonof the year, (fir, bamboo and almond); of scenery and human beings, orof birds or flowers; either of clusters of decoration, or of relics ofolden times; either of ten thousand characters of happiness or of tenthousand characters of longevity. The various kinds of designs had beenall carved by renowned hands, in variegated colours, inlaid with gold,and studded with precious gems; while on shelf upon shelf were eitherarranged collections of books, or tripods were laid out; either pens andinkslabs were distributed about, or vases with flowers set out, orfigured pots were placed about; the designs of the shelves being eitherround or square; or similar to sunflowers or banana leaves; or likelinks, half overlapping each other. And in very truth they resembledbouquets of flowers or clusters of tapestry, with all their fretwork sotransparent. Suddenly (the eye was struck) by variegated gauzes pasted(on the wood-work), actually forming small windows; and of a sudden byfine thin silks lightly overshadowing (the fretwork) just as if therewere, after all, secret doors. The whole walls were in addition traced,with no regard to symmetry, with outlines of the shapes of curios andnick-nacks in imitation of lutes, double-edged swords, hanging bottlesand the like, the whole number of which, though (apparently) suspendedon the walls, were all however on a same level with the surface of thepartition walls.
"What fine ingenuity!" they all exclaimed extollingly; "what a labourthey must have been to carry out!"
Chia Cheng had actually stepped in; but scarcely had they reached thesecond stage, before the whole party readily lost sight of the way bywhich they had come in. They glanced on the left, and there stood adoor, through which they could go. They cast their eyes on the right,and there was a window which suddenly impeded their progress. They wentforward, but there again they were obstructed by a bookcase. They turnedtheir heads round, and there too stood windows pasted with transparentgauze and available door-ways: but the moment they came face to facewith the door, they unexpectedly perceived that a whole company ofpeople had likewise walked in, just in front of them, whose appearanceresembled their own in every respect. But it was only a mirror. And whenthey rounded the mirror, they detected a still larger number of doors.
"Sir," Chia Chen remarked with a grin; "if you'll follow me out throughthis door, we'll forthwith get into the back-court; and once out of theback-court, we shall be, at all events, nearer than we were before."
Taking the lead, he conducted Chia Cheng and the whole party round twogauze mosquito houses, when they verily espied a door through which theymade their exit, into a court, replete with stands of cinnamon roses.Passing round the flower-laden hedge, the only thing that spread beforetheir view was a pure stream impeding their advance. The whole companywas lost in admiration. "Where does this water again issue from?" theycried.
Chia Chen pointed to a spot at a distance. "Starting originally," heexplained, "from that water-gate, it runs as far as the mouth of thatcave, when from among the hills on the north-east side, it is introducedinto that village, where again a diverging channel has been opened andit is made to flow in a south-westerly direction; the whole volume ofwater then runs to this spot, where collecting once more in one place,it issues, on its outward course, from beneath that wall."
"It's most ingenious!" they one and all exclaimed, after they hadlistened to him; but, as they uttered these words, they unawaresrealised that a lofty hill obstructed any further progress. The wholeparty felt very hazy about the right road. But "Come along after me,"Chia Chen smilingly urged, as he at once went ahead and showed the way,whereupon the company followed in his steps, and as soon as they turnedround the foot of the hill, a level place and broad road lay beforethem; and wide before their faces appeared the main entrance.
"This is charming! this is delightful!" the party unanimously exclaimed,"what wits must have been ransacked, and ingenuity attained, so as tobring things to this extreme degree of excellence!"
Forthwith the party egressed from the garden, and Pao-y�'s heartanxiously longed for the society of the young ladies in the innerquarters, but as he did not hear Chia Cheng bid him go, he had no helpbut to follow him into the library. But suddenly Chia Cheng bethoughthimself of him. "What," he said, "you haven't gone yet! the old ladywill I fear be anxious on your account; and is it pray that you haven'tas yet had enough walking?"
Pao-y� at length withdrew out of the library. On his arrival in thecourt, a page, who had been in attendance on Chia Cheng, at once pressedforward, and took hold of him fast in his arms. "You've been luckyenough," he said, "to-day to have been in master's good graces! just awhile back when our old mistress despatched servants to come on severaloccasions and ask after you, we replied that master was pleased withyou; for had we given any other answer, her ladyship would have sent tofetch you to go in, and you wouldn't have had an opportunity ofdisplaying your talents. Every one admits that the several stanzas yourecently composed were superior to those of the whole company puttogether; but you must, after the good luck you've had to-day, give us atip!"
"I'll give each one of you a tiao," Pao-y� rejoined smirkingly.
"Who of us hasn't seen a tiao?" they all exclaimed, "let's have thatpurse of yours, and have done with it!"
Saying this, one by one advanced and proceeded to unloosen the purse,and to unclasp the fan-case; and allowing Pao-y� no time to make anyremonstrance, they stripped him of every ornament in the way ofappendage which he carried about on his person. "Whatever we do let'sescort him home!" they shouted, and one after another hustled round himand accompanied him as far as dowager lady Chia's door.
Her ladyship was at this moment awaiting his arrival, so that when shesaw him walk in, and she found out that (Chia Cheng) had not bulliedhim, she felt, of course, extremely delighted. But not a long intervalelapsed before Hsi Jen came to serve the tea; and when she perceivedthat on his person not one of the ornaments remained, she consequentlysmiled and inquired: "Have all the things that you had on you been againtaken away by these barefaced rascals?"
As soon as Lin Tai-y� heard this remark, she crossed over to him and sawat a glance that not one single trinket was, in fact, left. "Have youalso given them," she felt constrained to ask, "the purse that I gaveyou? Well, by and by, when you again covet anything of mine, I shan'tlet you have it."
After uttering these words, she returned into her apartment in highdudgeon, and taking the scented bag, which Pao-y� had asked her to makefor him, and which she had not as yet finished, she picked up a pair ofscissors, and instantly cut it to pieces.
Pao-y� noticing that she had lost her temper, came after her withhurried step, but the bag had already been cut with the scissors; and asPao-y� observed how extremely fine and artistic this scented bag was, inspite of its unfinished state, he verily deplored that it should havebeen rent to pieces for no rhyme or reason. Promptly thereforeunbuttoning his coat, he produced from inside the lapel the purse, whichhad been fastened there. "Look at this!" he remarked as he handed it toTai-y�; "what kind of thing is this! have I given away to any one whatwas yours?" Lin Tai-y�, upon seeing how much he prized it as to wear itwithin his clothes, became alive to the fact that it was done withintent, as he feared lest any one should take it away; and as thisconviction made her sorry that she had been so impetuous as to have cutthe scented bag, she lowered her head and uttered not a word.
"There was really no need for you to have cut it," Pao-y� observed; "butas I know that you're loth to give me anything, what do you say to myreturning even this purse?"
With these words, he threw the purse in her lap and walked off; whichvexed Tai-y� so much the more that, after giving way to tears, she tookup the purse in her hands to also destroy it with the scissors, whenPao-y� precipitately turned round and snatched it from her grasp.
"My dear cousin," he smilingly pleaded, "do spare it!" and as Tai-y�dashed down the scissors and wiped her tears: "You needn't," she urged,"be kind to me at one moment, and unkind at another; if you wish to havea tiff, why then let's part company!" But as she spoke, she lost controlover her temper, and, jumping on her bed, she lay with her face turnedtowards the inside, and set to work drying her eyes.
Pao-y� could not refrain from approaching her. "My dear cousin, my owncousin," he added, "I confess my fault!"
"Go and find Pao-y�!" dowager lady Chia thereupon gave a shout fromwhere she was in the front apartment, and all the attendants explainedthat he was in Miss Lin's room.
"All right, that will do! that will do!" her ladyship rejoined, when sheheard this reply; "let the two cousins play together; his father kepthim a short while back under check, for ever so long, so let him havesome distraction. But the only thing is that you mustn't allow them tohave any quarrels." To which the servants in a body expressed theirobedience.
Tai-y�, unable to put up with Pao-y�'s importunity, felt compelled torise. "Your object seems to be," she remarked, "not to let me have anyrest. If it is, I'll run away from you." Saying which, she there andthen was making her way out, when Pao-y� protested with a face full ofsmiles: "Wherever you go, I'll follow!" and as he, at the same time,took the purse and began to fasten it on him, Tai-y� stretched out herhand, and snatching it away, "You say you don't want it," she observed,"and now you put it on again! I'm really much ashamed on your account!"And these words were still on her lips when with a sound of Ch'ih, sheburst out laughing.
"My dear cousin," Pao-y� added, "to-morrow do work another scented bagfor me!"
"That too will rest upon my good pleasure," Tai-y� rejoined.
As they conversed, they both left the room together and walked intomadame Wang's suite of apartments, where, as luck would have it,Pao-ch'ai was also seated.
Unusual commotion prevailed, at this time, over at madame Wang's, forthe fact is that Chia Se had already come back from Ku Su, where he hadselected twelve young girls, and settled about an instructor, as well asabout the theatrical properties and the other necessaries. And as Mrs.Hs�eh had by this date moved her quarters into a separate place on thenortheast side, and taken up her abode in a secluded and quiet house,(madame Wang) had had repairs of a distinct character executed in thePear Fragrance Court, and then issued directions that the instructorshould train the young actresses in this place; and casting her choiceupon all the women, who had, in days of old, received a training insinging, and who were now old matrons with white hair, she bade themhave an eye over them and keep them in order. Which done, she enjoinedChia Se to assume the chief control of all matters connected with thedaily and monthly income and outlay, as well as of the accounts of allarticles in use of every kind and size.
Lin Chih-hsiao also came to report: "that the twelve young nuns andTaoist girls, who had been purchased after proper selection, had allarrived, and that the twenty newly-made Taoist coats had also beenreceived. That there was besides a maiden, who though devoted toasceticism, kept her chevelure unshaved; that she was originally adenizen of Suchow, of a family whose ancestors were also people ofletters and official status; that as from her youth up she had beenstricken with much sickness, (her parents) had purchased a good numberof substitutes (to enter the convent), but all with no relief to her,until at last this girl herself entered the gate of abstraction when sheat once recovered. That hence it was that she grew her hair, while shedevoted herself to an ascetic life; that she was this year eighteenyears of age, and that the name given to her was Miao Y�; that herfather and mother were, at this time, already dead; that she had only byher side, two old nurses and a young servant girl to wait upon her; thatshe was most proficient in literature, and exceedingly well versed inthe classics and canons; and that she was likewise very attractive asfar as looks went; that having heard that in the city of Ch'ang-an,there were vestiges of Kuan Yin and relics of the canons inscribed onleaves, she followed, last year, her teacher (to the capital). She nowlives," he said, "in the Lao Ni nunnery, outside the western gate; herteacher was a great expert in prophetic divination, but she died in thewinter of last year, and her dying words were that as it was notsuitable for (Miao Y�) to return to her native place, she should awaithere, as something in the way of a denouement was certain to turn up;and this is the reason why she hasn't as yet borne the coffin back toher home!"
"If such be the case," madame Wang readily suggested, "why shouldn't webring her here?"
"If we are to ask her," Lin Chih-hsiao's wife replied, "she'll say thata marquis' family and a duke's household are sure, in their honourableposition, to be overbearing to people; and I had rather not go."
"As she's the daughter of an official family," madame Wang continued,"she's bound to be inclined to be somewhat proud; but what harm is thereto our sending her a written invitation to ask her to come!"
Lin Chih-hsiao's wife assented; and leaving the room, she made thesecretary write an invitation and then went to ask Miao Y�. The next dayservants were despatched, and carriages and sedan chairs were got readyto go and bring her over.
What subsequently transpired is not as yet known, but, reader, listen tothe account given in the following chapter.

CHAPTER XVIII.
  His Majesty shows magnanimous bounty.  The Imperial consort Yuan pays a visit to her parents.  The happiness of a family gathering.  Pao-y� displays his polished talents.
But let us resume our story. A servant came, at this moment, to reportthat for the works in course of execution, they were waiting for gauzeand damask silk to paste on various articles, and that they requestedlady Feng to go and open the dep�t for them to take the gauze and silk,while another servant also came to ask lady Feng to open the treasuryfor them to receive the gold and silver ware. And as Madame Wang, thewaiting-maids and the other domestics of the upper rooms had all noleisure, Pao-ch'ai suggested: "Don't let us remain in here and be in theway of their doing what there is to be done, and of going where theyhave to go," and saying this, she betook herself, escorted by Pao-y� andthe rest, into Ying Ch'un's rooms.
Madame Wang continued day after day in a great state of flurry andconfusion, straight up to within the tenth moon, by which time everyarrangement had been completed, and the overseers had all handed in aclear statement of their accounts. The curios and writing materials,wherever needed, had all already been laid out and everything got ready,and the birds (and animals), from the stork, the deer and rabbits to thechickens, geese and the like, had all been purchased and handed over tobe reared in the various localities in the garden; and over at ChiaSe's, had also been learnt twenty miscellaneous plays, while a companyof young nuns and Taoist priestesses had likewise the whole number ofthem, mastered the intonation of Buddhist classics and incantations.
Chia Cheng after this, at length, was slightly composed in mind, andcheerful at heart; and having further invited dowager lady Chia andother inmates to go into the garden, he deliberated with them on, andmade arrangements for, every detail in such a befitting manner that notthe least trifle remained for which suitable provision had not beenmade; and Chia Cheng eventually mustered courage to indite a memorial,and on the very day on which the memorial was presented, a decree wasreceived fixing upon the fifteenth day of the first moon of the ensuingyear, the very day of the Shang Yuan festival, for the honourableconsorts to visit their homes.
Upon the receipt of this decree, with which the Chia family washonoured, they had still less leisure, both by day as well as by night;so much so that they could not even properly observe the new yearfestivities. But in a twinkle of the eye, the festival of the full moonof the first moon drew near; and beginning from the eighth day of thefirst moon, eunuchs issued from the palace and inspected beforehand thevarious localities, the apartments in which the imperial consort was tochange her costume; the place where she would spend her leisure moments;the spot where she would receive the conventionalities; the premiseswhere the banquets would be spread; the quarters where she would retirefor rest.
There were also eunuchs who came to assume the patrol of the grounds andthe direction of the defences; and they brought along with them a goodmany minor eunuchs, whose duty it was to look after the safety of thevarious localities, to screen the place with enclosing curtains, toinstruct the inmates and officials of the Chia mansion whither to go outand whence to come in from, what side the viands should be brought infrom, where to report matters, and in the observance of every kind ofetiquette; and for outside the mansion, there were, on the other hand,officers from the Board of Works, and a superintendent of the Police, ofthe "Five Cities," in charge of the sweeping of the streets and roads,and the clearing away of loungers. While Chia She and the otherssuperintended the workmen in such things as the manufacture of floweredlanterns and fireworks.
The fourteenth day arrived and everything was in order; but on thisnight, one and all whether high or low, did not get a wink of sleep; andwhen the fifteenth came, every one, at the fifth watch, beginning fromdowager lady Chia and those who enjoyed any official status, appeared infull gala dress, according to their respective ranks. In the garden, thecurtains were, by this time, flapping like dragons, the portieres flyingabout like phoenixes with variegated plumage. Gold and silver glistenedwith splendour. Pearls and precious gems shed out their brilliantlustre. The tripod censers burnt the Pai-ho incense. In the vases wereplaced evergreens. Silence and stillness prevailed, and not a manventured so much as to cough.
Chia She and the other men were standing outside the door giving on tothe street on the west; and old lady Chia and the other ladies wereoutside the main entrance of the Jung mansion at the head of the street,while at the mouth of the lane were placed screens to rigorouslyobstruct the public gaze. They were unable to bear the fatigue of anyfurther waiting when, at an unexpected moment, a eunuch arrived onhorseback, and Chia Cheng went up to meet him, and ascertained whattidings he was the bearer of.
"It's as yet far too early," rejoined the eunuch, "for at one o'clock(her highness) will have her evening repast, and at two she has tobetake herself to the Palace of Precious Perception to worship Buddha.At five, she will enter the Palace of Great Splendour to partake of abanquet, and to see the lanterns, after which, she will request HisMajesty's permission; so that, I'm afraid, it won't be earlier thanseven before they set out."
Lady Feng's ear caught what was said. "If such be the case," sheinterposed, "may it please your venerable ladyship, and you, my lady, toreturn for a while to your apartments, and wait; and if you come whenit's time you'll be here none too late."
Dowager lady Chia and the other ladies immediately left for a time andsuited their own convenience, and as everything in the garden devolvedupon lady Feng to supervise, she ordered the butlers to take the eunuchsand give them something to eat and drink; and at the same time, she sentword that candles should be brought in and that the lanterns in thevarious places should be lit.
But unexpectedly was heard from outside the continuous patter of horsesrunning, whereupon about ten eunuchs hurried in gasping and out ofbreath. They clapped their hands, and the several eunuchs (who had comebefore), understanding the signal, and knowing that the party hadarrived, stood in their respective positions; while Chia She, at thehead of all the men of the clan, remained at the western street door,and dowager lady Chia, at the head of the female relatives of thefamily, waited outside the principal entrance to do the honours.
For a long interval, everything was plunged in silence and quiet; whensuddenly two eunuchs on horseback were espied advancing with leisurelystep. Reaching the western street gate, they dismounted, and, drivingtheir horses beyond the screens, they forthwith took their stand facingthe west. After another long interval, a second couple arrived, and wentlikewise through the same proceedings. In a short time, drew near aboutten couples, when, at length, were heard the gentle strains of music,and couple by couple advanced with banners, dragons, with fans made withphoenix feathers, and palace flabella of pheasant plumes; and thosebesides who carried gold-washed censers burning imperial incense. Nextin order was brought past a state umbrella of golden yellow, withcrooked handle and embroidered with seven phoenixes; after which quicklyfollowed the crown, robe, girdle and shoes.
There were likewise eunuchs, who took a part in the procession, holdingscented handkerchiefs and embroidered towels, cups for rinsing themouth, dusters and other such objects; and company after company wentpast, when, at the rear, approached with stately step eight eunuchscarrying an imperial sedan chair, of golden yellow, with a gold knob andembroidered with phoenixes.
Old lady Chia and the other members of the family hastily fell on theirknees, but a eunuch came over at once to raise her ladyship and therest; and the imperial chair was thereupon carried through the mainentrance, the ceremonial gate and into a court on the eastern side, atthe door of which stood a eunuch, who prostrated himself and invited(her highness) to dismount and change her costume.
Having forthwith carried her inside the gate, the eunuchs dispersed; andonly the maids-of-honour and ladies-in-waiting ushered Yuan Ch'un out ofthe chair, when what mainly attracted her eye in the park was thebrilliant lustre of the flowered lamps of every colour, all of whichwere made of gauze or damask, and were beautiful in texture, and out ofthe common run; while on the upper side was a flat lantern with theinscription in four characters, "Regarded (by His Majesty's) benevolenceand permeated by his benefits."
Yuan Ch'un entered the apartment and effected the necessary changes inher toilette; after which, she again egressed, and, mounting her chair,she made her entry into the garden, when she perceived the smoke ofincense whirling and twirling, and the reflection of the flowersconfusing the eyes. Far and wide, the rays of light, shed by thelanterns, intermingled their brilliancy, while, from time to time, finestrains of music sounded with clamorous din. But it would be impossibleto express adequately the perfect harmony in the aspect of this scene,and the grandeur of affluence and splendour.
The imperial consort of the Chia family, we must now observe, uponcatching sight, from the interior of her chair, of the picture presentedwithin as well as without the confines of this garden, shook her headand heaved a sigh. "What lavish extravagance! What excessive waste!" shesoliloquised.
But of a sudden was again seen a eunuch who, on his knees, invited herto get into a boat; and the Chia consort descended from the chair andstepped into the craft, when the expanse of a limpid stream met hergaze, whose grandeur resembled that of the dragon in its listlesscourse. The stone bannisters, on each side, were one mass of air-tightlanterns, of every colour, made of crystal or glass, which threw out alight like the lustre of silver or the brightness of snow.
The willow, almond and the whole lot of trees, on the upper side, were,it is true, without blossom and leaves; but pongee and damask silks,paper and lustring had been employed, together with rice-paper, to makeflowers of, which had been affixed on the branches. Upon each tree weresuspended thousands of lanterns; and what is more, the lotus and aquaticplants, the ducks and water fowl in the pond had all, in like manner,been devised out of conches and clams, plumes and feathers. The variouslanterns, above and below, vied in refulgence. In real truth, it was acrystal region, a world of pearls and precious stones. On board the boatwere also every kind of lanterns representing such designs as are usedon flower-pots, pearl-laden portieres, embroidered curtains, oars ofcinnamon wood, and paddles of magnolia, which need not of course beminutely described.
They entered a landing with a stone curb; and on this landing waserected a flat lantern upon which were plainly visible the fourcharacters the "Persicary beach and flower-laden bank." But, reader, youhave heard how that these four characters "the persicary beach and theflower-laden bank," the motto "a phoenix comes with dignified air," andthe rest owe one and all their origin to the unexpected test to whichChia Cheng submitted, on a previous occasion, Pao-y�'s literaryabilities; but how did it come about that they were actually adopted?
You must remember that the Chia family had been, generation aftergeneration, given to the study of letters, so that it was only naturalthat there should be among them one or two renowned writers of verses;for how could they ever resemble the families of such upstarts, who onlyemploy puerile expressions as a makeshift to get through what they haveto do? But the why and the wherefore must be sought in the past. Theconsort, belonging to the Chia mansion, had, before she entered thepalace, been, from her infancy, also brought up by dowager lady Chia;and when Pao-y� was subsequently added to the family, she was the eldestsister and Pao-y� the youngest child. The Chia consort, bearing in mindhow that she had, when her mother was verging on old age, at lengthobtained this younger brother, she for this reason doated upon him withsingle love; and as they were besides companions in their attendanceupon old lady Chia, they were inseparable for even a moment. BeforePao-y� had entered school, and when three or four years of age, he hadalready received oral instruction from the imperial spouse Chia from thecontents of several books and had committed to memory several thousandsof characters, for though they were only sister and brother, they werelike mother and child. And after she had entered the Palace, she waswont time and again to have letters taken out to her father and hercousins, urgently recommending them to be careful with his bringing up,that if they were not strict, he could not possibly become good foranything, and that if they were immoderately severe, there was thedanger of something unpropitious befalling him, with the result,moreover, that his grandmother would be stricken with sorrow; and thissolicitude on his account was never for an instant lost sight of by her.
Hence it was that Chia Cheng having, a few days back, heard his teacherextol him for his extreme abilities, he forthwith put him to the test onthe occasion of their ramble through the garden. And though (hiscompositions) were not in the bold style of a writer of note, yet theywere productions of their own family, and would, moreover, beinstrumental, when the Chia consort had her notice attracted by them,and come to know that they were devised by her beloved brother, in alsonot rendering nugatory the anxious interest which she had everentertained on his behalf, and he, therefore, purposely adopted what hadbeen suggested by Pao-y�; while for those places, for which on that dayno devices had been completed, a good number were again subsequentlycomposed to make up what was wanted.
After the Chia consort had, for we shall now return to her, perused thefour characters, she gave a smile. "The two words 'flower-laden bank,'"she said, "are really felicitous, so what use was there for 'persicarybeach?'"
When the eunuch in waiting heard this observation, he promptly jumpedoff the craft on to the bank, and at a flying pace hurried tocommunicate it to Chia Cheng, and Chia Cheng instantly effected thenecessary alteration.
By this time the craft had reached the inner bank, and leaving the boat,and mounting into her sedan chair, she in due course contemplated themagnificent Jade-like Palace; the Hall of cinnamon wood, lofty andsublime; and the marble portals with the four characters in bold style:the "Precious confines of heavenly spirits," which the Chia consort gavedirections should be changed for the four words denoting: "additionalHall (for the imperial consort) on a visit to her parents." Andforthwith making her entrance into the travelling lodge her gaze wasattracted by torches burning in the court encompassing the heavens,fragments of incense strewn on the ground, fire-like trees and gem-likeflowers, gold-like windows and jade-like bannisters. But it would bedifficult to give a full account of the curtains, which rolled up (asfine as a) shrimp's moustache; of the carpets of other skins spread onthe floor; of the tripods exhaling the fragrant aroma of the brain ofthe musk deer; of the screens in a row resembling fans made of pheasanttails. Indeed, the gold-like doors and the windows like jade weresuggestive of the abode of spirits; while the halls made of cinnamonwood and the palace of magnolia timber, of the very homes of theimperial secondary consorts.
"Why is it," the Chia consort inquired, "that there is no tablet in thisHall?"
The eunuch in waiting fell on his knees. "This is the main Hall," hereverently replied, "and the officials, outside the palace, did notpresume to take upon themselves to suggest any motto."
The Chia consort shook her head and said not a word; whereupon theeunuch, who acted as master of ceremonies, requested Her Majesty toascend the throne and receive homage. The band stationed on the twoflights of steps struck up a tune, while two eunuchs ushered Chia She,Chia Cheng and the other members on to the moonlike stage, where theyarranged themselves in order and ascended into the hall, but when theladies-in-waiting transmitted her commands that the homage could bedispensed with, they at once retraced their footsteps.
(The master of the ceremonies), in like manner led forward the dowagerlady of the Jung Kuo mansion, as well as the female relatives, from thesteps on the east side, on to the moon-like stage; where they wereplaced according to their ranks. But the maids-of-honour again commandedthat they should dispense with the ceremony, so they likewise promptlywithdrew.
After tea had been thrice presented, the Chia consort descended theThrone, and the music ceased. She retired into a side room to change hercostume, and the private chairs were then got ready for her visit to herparents. Issuing from the garden, she came into the main quartersbelonging to dowager lady Chia, where she was bent upon observing thedomestic conventionalities, when her venerable ladyship, and the othermembers of the family, prostrated themselves in a body before her, andmade her desist. Tears dropped down from the eyes of the Chia consort as(she and her relatives) mutually came forward, and greeted each other,and as with one hand she grasped old lady Chia, and with the other sheheld madame Wang, the three had plenty in their hearts which they werefain to speak about; but, unable as each one of them was to giveutterance to their feelings, all they did was to sob and to weep, asthey kept face to face to each other; while madame Hsing, widow Li Wan,Wang Hsi-feng, and the three sisters: Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and HsiCh'un, stood aside in a body shedding tears and saying not a word.
After a long time, the Chia consort restrained her anguish, and forcinga smile, she set to work to reassure old lady Chia and madame Wang."Having in days gone by," she urged, "been sent to that place where nohuman being can be seen, I have to-day after extreme difficulty returnedhome; and now that you ladies and I have been reunited, instead ofchatting or laughing we contrariwise give way to incessant tears! Butshortly, I shall be gone, and who knows when we shall be able again toeven see each other!"
When she came to this sentence, they could not help bursting intoanother tit of crying; and Madame Hsing hastened to come forward, and toconsole dowager lady Chia and the rest. But when the Chia consortresumed her seat, and one by one came again, in turn, to exchangesalutations, they could not once more help weeping and sobbing for atime.
Next in order, were the managers and servants of the eastern and westernmansions to perform their obeisance in the outer pavilion; and after themarried women and waiting-maids had concluded their homage, the Chiaconsort heaved a sigh. "How many relatives," she observed, "there areall of whom, alas! I may not see."
"There are here now," madame Wang rejoined with due respect, "kindredwith outside family names, such as Mrs. Hs�eh, n�e Wang, Pao-ch'ai, andTai-y� waiting for your commands; but as they are distant relatives, andwithout official status, they do not venture to arrogate to themselvesthe right of entering into your presence." But the Chia consort issueddirections that they should be invited to come that they should see eachother; and in a short while, Mrs. Hs�eh and the other relatives walkedin, but as they were on the point of performing the rites, prescribed bythe state, she bade them relinquish the observance so that they cameforward, and each, in turn, alluded to what had transpired during thelong separation.
Pao Ch'in also and a few other waiting-maids, whom the Chia consort hadoriginally taken along with her into the palace, knocked their headsbefore dowager lady Chia, but her ladyship lost no time in raising themup, and in bidding them go into a separate suite of rooms to beentertained; and as for the retainers, eunuchs as well asmaids-of-honour, ladies-in-waiting and every attendant, there wereneedless to say, those in the two places, the Ning mansion and ChiaShe's residence, to wait upon them; there only remained three or fouryoung eunuchs to answer the summons.
The mother and daughter and her cousins conversed for some time on whathad happened during the protracted separation, as well as on domesticaffairs and their private feelings, when Chia Cheng likewise advanced asfar as the other side of the portiere, and inquired after her health,and the Chia consort from inside performed the homage and otherconventionalities (due to her parent).
"The families of farmers," she further went on to say to her father,"feed on salted cabbage, and clothe in cotton material; but they readilyenjoy the happiness of the relationships established by heaven! We,however, relatives though we now be of one bone and flesh, are, with allour affluence and honours, living apart from each other, and deriving nohappiness whatsoever!"
Chia Cheng, on his part endeavoured, to restrain his tears. "Ibelonged," he rejoined, "to a rustic and poor family; and among thatwhole number of pigeons and pheasants, how could I have imagined that Iwould have obtained the blessing of a hidden phoenix! Of late all forthe sake of your honourable self, His Majesty, above, confers upon ushis heavenly benefits; while we, below, show forth the virtue of ourancestors! And it is mainly because the vital principle of the hills,streams, sun, and moon, and the remote virtue of our ancestors have beenimplanted in you alone that this good fortune has attained me Cheng andmy wife! Moreover, the present emperor, bearing in mind the great bountyshewn by heaven and earth in promoting a ceaseless succession, hasvouchsafed a more generous act of grace than has ever been displayedfrom old days to the present. And although we may besmear our liver andbrain in the mire, how could we show our gratitude, even to so slight adegree as one ten-thousandth part. But all I can do is, in the daytime,to practise diligence, vigilance at night, and loyalty in my officialduties. My humble wish is that His Majesty, my master, may live tenthousand years and see thousands of autumns, so as to promote thewelfare of all mankind in the world! And you, worthy imperial consort,must, on no account, be mindful of me Cheng and my wife, decrepid as weare in years. What I would solicit more than anything is that you shouldbe more careful of yourself, and that you should be diligent andreverential in your service to His Majesty, with the intent that you maynot prove ungrateful of his affectionate regard and bountiful grace."
The Chia consort, on the other hand, enjoined "that much as it wasexpedient to display zeal, in the management of state matters, itbehoved him, when he had any leisure, to take good care of himself, andthat he should not, whatever he did, give way to solicitude on herbehalf." And Chia Cheng then went on to say "that the variousinscriptions in the park over the pavilions, terraces, halls andresidences had been all composed by Pao-y�, and, that in the event ofthere being one or two that could claim her attention, he would be happyif it would please her to at once favour him with its name." Whereuponthe imperial consort Y�an, when she heard that Pao-y� could composeverses, forthwith exclaimed with a smile: "He has in very truth madeprogress!"
After Chia Cheng had retired out of the hall, the Chia consort made it apoint to ask: "How is it that I do not see Pao-y�?" and dowager ladyChia explained: "An outside male relative as he is, and without officialrank, he does not venture to appear before you of his own accord."
"Bring him in!" the imperial consort directed; whereupon a young eunuchushered Pao-y� in. After he had first complied with the stateceremonies, she bade him draw near to her, and taking his hand, she heldit in her lap, and, as she went on to caress his head and neck, shesmiled and said: "He's grown considerably taller than he was before;"but she had barely concluded this remark, when her tears ran down asprofuse as rain. Mrs. Yu, lady Feng, and the rest pressed forward. "Thebanquet is quite ready," they announced, "and your highness is requestedto favour the place with your presence."
The imperial consort Yuan stood up and asking Pao-y� to lead the way,she followed in his steps, along with the whole party, and betookherself on foot as far as the entrance of the garden gate, whence she atonce espied, in the lustre shed by the lanterns, every kind ofdecorations. Entering the garden, they first passed the spots with thedevice "a phoenix comes with dignified air," "the red (flowers are)fragrant and the green (banana leaves like) jade!" "the sign on theapricot tree is visible," "the fragrance pure of the ligularia andiris," and other places; and ascending the towers they walked up thehalls, forded the streams and wound round the hills; contemplating asthey turned their gaze from side to side, each place arranged in adifferent style, and each kind of article laid out in unique designs.The Chia consort expressed her admiration in most profuse eulogiums, andthen went on to advise them: "that it was not expedient to indulge infuture in such excessive extravagance and that all these arrangementswere over and above what should have been done."
Presently they reached the main pavilion, where she commanded that theycould dispense with the rites and take their seats. A sumptuous banquetwas laid out, at which dowager lady Chia and the other ladies occupiedthe lower seats and entertained each other, while Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan,lady Feng and the rest presented the soup and handed the cups. TheImperial consort Yuan subsequently directed that the pencils andinkslabs should be brought, and with her own hands she opened the silkenpaper. She chose the places she liked, and conferred upon them a name;and devising a general designation for the garden, she called it the TaKuan garden (Broad vista), while for the tablet of the main pavilion thedevice she composed ran as follows: "Be mindful of the grace andremember the equity (of His Majesty);" with this inscription on theantithetical scrolls:
  Mercy excessive Heaven and earth display,  And it men young and old hail gratefully;  From old till now they pour their bounties great  Those rich gifts which Cathay and all states permeate.
Changing also the text: "A phoenix comes with dignified air for theHsiao Hsiang Lodge."
"The red (flowers are) fragrant and the green (banana leaves like)jade," she altered into "Happy red and joyful green"; bestowing upon theplace the appellation of the I Hung court (joyful red). The spot where"the fragrance pure of the ligularia and iris," was inscribed, shecalled "the ligularia and the 'Wu' weed court;" and where was "the signin the apricot tree is visible," she designated "the cottage in thehills where dolichos is bleached." The main tower she called the BroadVista Tower. The lofty tower facing the east, she designated "thevariegated and flowery Hall;" bestowing on the line of buildings, facingthe west, the appellation of "the Hall of Occult Fragrance;" and besidesthese figured such further names as: "the Hall of peppery wind," "theArbour of lotus fragrance," "the Islet of purple caltrop," "the Bank ofgolden lotus," and the like. There were also tablets with fourcharacters such as: "the peach blossom and the vernal rain;" "theautumnal wind prunes the Eloecocca," "the artemisia leaves and the nightsnow," and other similar names which could not all be placed on record.She furthermore directed that such tablets as were already put up,should not be dismounted, and she forthwith took the lead and composedan heptameter stanza, the burden of which was:
  Hills it enclasps, embraces streams, with skill it is laid out:  What task the grounds to raise! the works to start and bring about!  Of scenery in heaven and amongst men store has been made;  The name Broad Vista o'er the fragrant park should be engraved.
When she had finished writing, she observed smilingly, as she addressedherself to all the young ladies: "I have all along lacked the quality ofsharpness and never besides been good at verses; as you, sisters, andall of you have ever been aware; but, on a night like this I've beenfain to do my best, with the object of escaping censure, and of notreflecting injustice on this scenery and nothing more. But some otherday when I've got time, be it ever so little, I shall deem it my duty tomake up what remains by inditing a record of the Broad Vista Garden, aswell as a song on my visit to my parents and other such literaryproductions in memory of the events of this day. You sisters and othersmust, each of you, in like manner compose a stanza on the motto on eachtablet, expressing your sentiments, as you please, without beingrestrained by any regard for my meagre ability. Knowing as I do besidesthat Pao-y� is, indeed, able to write verses, I feel the more delighted!But among his compositions, those I like the best are those in the twoplaces, 'the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge,' and 'the court of Heng and Wu;' andnext those of 'the Joyful red court,' and 'the cottage in the hills,where the dolichos is bleached.' As for grand sites like these four,there should be found some out-of-the-way expressions to insert in theverses so that they should be felicitous. The antithetical linescomposed by you, (Pao-y�), on a former occasion are excellent, it istrue; but you should now further indite for each place, a pentameterstanza, so that by allowing me to test you in my presence, you may notshow yourself ungrateful for the trouble I have taken in teaching youfrom your youth up."
Pao-y� had no help but to assent, and descending from the hall, he wentoff all alone to give himself up to reflection.
Of the three Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, T'an Ch'un must beconsidered to have also been above the standard of her sisters, but she,in her own estimation, imagined it, in fact, difficult to compete withHs�eh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-y�. With no alternative however than that ofdoing her best, she followed the example of all the rest with the solepurpose of warding off criticism. And Li Wan too succeeded, after muchexertion, in putting together a stanza.
The consort of the Chia family perused in due order the verses writtenby the young ladies, the text of which is given below.
The lines written by Ying Ch'un on the tablet of "Boundless spirits andblissful heart" were:
  A park laid out with scenery surpassing fine and rare!  Submissive to thy will, on boundless bliss bashful I write!  Who could believe that yonder scenes in this world found a share!  Will not thy heart be charmed on thy visit by the sight?
These are the verses by T'an Ch'un on the tablet of "All nature vies insplendour":
  Of aspect lofty and sublime is raised a park of fame!  Honoured with thy bequest, my shallow lore fills me with shame.  No words could e'er amply exhaust the beauteous skill,  For lo! in very truth glory and splendour all things fill!
Thus runs Hsi Ch'un's stanza on the tablet of the "Conception ofliterary compositions":
  The hillocks and the streams crosswise beyond a thousand li extend!  The towers and terraces 'midst the five-coloured clouds lofty ascend!  In the resplendent radiance of both sun and moon the park it lies!  The skill these scenes to raise the skill e'en essays to conceive      outvies!
The lines composed by Li Wan on the tablet "grace and elegance,"consisted of:
  The comely streams and hillocks clear, in double folds, embrace;  E'en Fairyland, forsooth, transcend they do in elegance and grace!  The "Fragrant Plant" the theme is of the ballad fan, green-made.  Like drooping plum-bloom flap the lapel red and the Hsiang gown.  From prosperous times must have been handed down those pearls and      jade.  What bliss! the fairy on the jasper terrace will come down!  When to our prayers she yields, this glorious park to contemplate,  No mortal must e'er be allowed these grounds to penetrate.
The ode by Hs�eh Pao-ch'ai on the tablet of "Concentrated Splendour andAccumulated auspiciousness" was:
  Raised on the west of the Imperial city, lo! the park stored with      fragrant smell,  Shrouded by Phoebe's radiant rays and clouds of good omen, in wondrous      glory lies!  The willows tall with joy exult that the parrots their nests have      shifted from the dell.  The bamboo groves, when laid, for the phoenix with dignity to come,      were meant to rise.  The very eve before the Empress' stroll, elegant texts were ready and      affixed.  If even she her parents comes to see, how filial piety supreme must      be!  When I behold her beauteous charms and talents supernatural, with awe      transfixed,  One word, to utter more how can I troth ever presume, when shame      overpowers me.
The distich by Lin Tai-y� on the tablet of "Spiritual stream outside theworld," ran thus:
  Th' imperial visit doth enhance joy and delight.  This fairy land from mortal scenes what diff'rent sight!  The comely grace it borrows of both hill and stream;  And to the landscape it doth add a charm supreme.  The fumes of Chin Ku wine everything permeate;  The flowers the inmate of the Jade Hall fascinate.  The imperial favour to receive how blessed our lot!  For oft the palace carriage will pass through this spot.
The Chia consort having concluded the perusal of the verses, andextolled them for a time: "After all," she went on to say with a smile,"those composed by my two cousins, Hs�eh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-y�,differ in excellence from those of all the rest; and neither I, stupidas I am, nor my sisters can attain their standard."
Lin Tao-y� had, in point of fact, made up her mind to display, on thisevening, her extraordinary abilities to their best advantage, and to putdown every one else, but contrary to her expectations the Chia consorthad expressed her desire that no more than a single stanza should bewritten on each tablet, so that unable, after all, to disregard herdirections by writing anything in excess, she had no help but to composea pentameter stanza, in an offhand way, merely with the intent ofcomplying with her wishes.
Pao-y� had by this time not completed his task. He had just finished twostanzas on the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge and the Heng Wu garden, and was justthen engaged in composing a verse on the "Happy red Court." In his draftfigured a line: "The (leaves) of jade-like green in spring are yetrolled up," which Pao-ch'ai stealthily observed as she turned her eyesfrom side to side; and availing herself of the very first moment, whennone of the company could notice her, she gave him a nudge. "As herhighness," she remarked, "doesn't relish the four characters,representing the red (flowers are) fragrant, and the green (bananaleaves) like jade, she changed them, just a while back, for 'the joyfulred and gladsome green;' and if you deliberately now again employ thesetwo words 'jade-like green,' won't it look as if you were bent uponbeing at variance with her? Besides, very many are the old books, inwhich the banana leaves form the theme, so you had better think ofanother line and substitute it and have done with it!"
When Pao-y� heard the suggestion made by Pao-ch'ai, he speedily replied,as he wiped off the perspiration: "I can't at all just at present callto mind any passage from the contents of some old book."
"Just simply take," proposed Pao-ch'ai smilingly, "the character jade injade-like green and change it into the character wax, that's all."
"Does 'green wax,'" Pao-y� inquired, "come out from anywhere?"
Pao-ch'ai gently smacked her lips and nodded her head as she laughed. "Ifear," she said, "that if, on an occasion like to-night, you show nomore brains than this, by and by when you have to give any answers inthe golden hall, to the questions (of the examiner), you will, really,forget (the very first four names) of Chao, Oh'ien, Sun and Li (out ofthe hundred)! What, have you so much as forgotten the first line of thepoem by Han Y�, of the T'ang dynasty, on the Banana leaf:
 "Cold is the candle and without a flame, the green wax dry?"
On hearing these words, Pao-y�'s mind suddenly became enlightened. "Whata fool I am!" he added with a simper; "I couldn't for the moment evenremember the lines, ready-made though they were and staring at me in myvery eyes! Sister, you really can be styled my teacher, little thoughyou may have taught me, and I'll henceforward address you by no othername than 'teacher,' and not call you 'sister' any more!"
"Don't you yet hurry to go on," Pao-ch'ai again observed in a gentletone of voice sneeringly, "but keep on calling me elder sister andyounger sister? Who's your sister? that one over there in a yellow coatis your sister!"
But apprehending, as she bandied these jokes, lest she might be wastinghis time, she felt constrained to promptly move away; whereupon Pao-y�continued the ode he had been working at, and brought it to a close,writing in all three stanzas.
Tai-y� had not had so far an opportunity of making a display of herability, and was feeling at heart in a very dejected mood; but when sheperceived that Pao-y� was having intense trouble in conceiving what hehad to write, and she found, upon walking up to the side of the table,that he had only one stanza short, that on "the sign on the apricot treeis visible," she consequently bade him copy out clean the first threeodes, while she herself composed a stanza, which she noted down on aslip of paper, rumpled up into a ball, and threw just in front ofPao-y�.
As soon as Pao-y� opened it and glanced at it, he realised that it was ahundred times better than his own three stanzas, and transcribing itwithout loss of time, in a bold writing, he handed up his compositions.
On perusal, the Chia Consort read what follows. By Pao-y�, on: "Aphoenix comes with dignified air:"
  The bamboos just now don that jadelike grace,  Which worthy makes them the pheasant to face;  Each culm so tender as if to droop fain,  Each one so verdant, in aspect so cool,  The curb protects, from the steps wards the pool.  The pervious screens the tripod smell restrain.  The shadow will be strewn, mind do not shake  And (Hsieh) from her now long fine dream (awake)!
On "the pure fragrance of the Ligularia and Iris Florentina:"
  Hengs and Wus the still park permeate;  The los and pis their sweet perfume enhance;  And supple charms the third spring flowers ornate;  Softly is wafted one streak of fragrance!  A light mist doth becloud the tortuous way!  With moist the clothes bedews, that verdure cold!  The pond who ever sinuous could hold?  Dreams long and subtle, dream the household Hsieh.
On "the happy red and joyful green:"
  Stillness pervades the deep pavilion on a lengthy day.  The green and red, together matched, transcendent grace display.  Unfurled do still remain in spring the green and waxlike leaves.  No sleep yet seeks the red-clad maid, though night's hours be      far-spent,  But o'er the rails lo, she reclines, dangling her ruddy sleeves;  Against the stone she leans shrouded by taintless scent,  And stands the quarter facing whence doth blow the eastern wind!  Her lord and master must look up to her with feelings kind.
On "the sign on the apricot tree is visible:"
  The apricot tree sign to drink wayfarers doth invite;  A farm located on a hill, lo! yonder strikes the sight!  And water caltrops, golden lotus, geese, as well as flows,  And mulberry and elm trees which afford rest to swallows.  That wide extent of spring leeks with verdure covers the ground;  And o'er ten li the paddy blossom fragrance doth abound.  In days of plenty there's a lack of dearth and of distress,  And what need then is there to plough and weave with such briskness?
When the Chia consort had done with the perusal, excessive joy filledher heart. "He has indeed made progress!" she exclaimed, and went on topoint at the verses on "the sign on the apricot tree," as being thecrowning piece of the four stanzas. In due course, she with her ownhands changed the motto "a cottage in the hills where dolichos isbleached" into "the paddy-scented village;" and bidding also T'an Ch'unto take the several tens of stanzas written then, and to transcribe themseparately on ornamented silk paper, she commanded a eunuch to send themto the outer quarters. And when Chia Cheng and the other men perusedthem, one and all sung their incessant praise, while Chia Cheng, on hispart, sent in some complimentary message, with regard to her return homeon a visit.
Yuan Ch'un went further and gave orders that luscious wines, a ham andother such presents should be conferred upon Pao-y�, as well as uponChia Lan. This Chia Lan was as yet at this time a perfect youth withoutany knowledge of things in general, so that all that he could do was tofollow the example of his mother, and imitate his uncle in performingthe conventional rites.
At the very moment that Chia Se felt unable, along with a company ofactresses, to bear the ordeal of waiting on the ground floor of thetwo-storied building, he caught sight of a eunuch come running at aflying pace. "The composition of verses is over," he said, "so quickgive me the programme;" whereupon Chia Se hastened to present theprogramme as well as a roll of the names of the twelve girls. And not along interval elapsed before four plays were chosen; No. 1 being theImperial Banquet; No. 2 Begging (the weaver goddess) for skill inneedlework; No. 3 The spiritual match; and No. 4 the Parting spirit.Chia Se speedily lent a hand in the getting up, and the preparations forthe performance, and each of the girls sang with a voice sufficient tosplit the stones and danced in the manner of heavenly spirits; andthough their exterior was that of the characters in which they weredressed up for the play, their acting nevertheless represented, in aperfect manner, both sorrow as well as joy. As soon as the performancewas brought to a close, a eunuch walked in holding a golden salvercontaining cakes, sweets, and the like, and inquired who was Ling Kuan;and Chia Se readily concluding that these articles were presentsbestowed upon Ling Kuan, made haste to take them over, as he bade LingKuan prostrate herself.
"The honourable consort," the eunuch further added, "directs that LingKuan, who is the best actress of the lot, should sing two more songs;any two will do, she does not mind what they are."
Chia Se at once expressed his obedience, and felt constrained to urgeLing Kuan to sing the two ballads entitled: "The walk through thegarden" and "Frightened out of a dream." But Ling Kuan asserted thatthese two ballads had not originally been intended for her own role; andbeing firm in her refusal to accede and insisting upon rendering the twosongs "The Mutual Promise" and "The Mutual Abuse," Chia Se found it hardto bring her round, and had no help but to let her have her own way. TheChia consort was so extremely enchanted with her that she gavedirections that she should not be treated harshly, and that this girlshould receive a careful training, while besides the fixed number ofpresents, she gave her two rolls of palace silk, two purses, gold andsilver ingots, and presents in the way of eatables.
Subsequently, when the banquet had been cleared, and she once moreprosecuted her visit through those places to which she had not been, shequite accidentally espied the Buddhist Temple encircled by hills, andpromptly rinsing her hands, she walked in and burnt incense andworshipped Buddha. She also composed the device for a tablet, "a humaneboat on the (world's) bitter sea," and went likewise so far as to showspecial acts of additional grace to a company of ascetic nuns and Taoistpriestesses.
A eunuch came in a short while and reverently fell on his knees. "Thepresents are all in readiness," he reported, "and may it please you toinspect them and to distribute them, in compliance with custom;" andpresented to her a list, which the Chia consort perused from the verytop throughout without raising any objection, and readily commandingthat action should be taken according to the list, a eunuch descendedand issued the gifts one after another. The presents for dowager ladyChia consisted, it may be added, of two sceptres, one of gold, the otherof jade, with "may your wishes be fulfilled" inscribed on them; a staffmade of lign-aloes; a string of chaplet beads of Chia-nan fragrant wood;four rolls of imperial satins with words "Affluence and honours" andPerennial Spring (woven in them); four rolls of imperial silk withPerennial Happiness and Longevity; two shoes of purple gold bullion,representing a pen, an ingot and "as you like;" and ten silver ingotswith the device "Felicitous Blessings." While the two shares for madameHsing and madame Wang were only short of hers by the sceptres andstaffs, four things in all. Chia She, Chia Cheng and the others had eachapportioned to him a work newly written by the Emperor, two boxes ofsuperior ink, and gold and silver cups, two pairs of each; their othergifts being identical with those above. Pao-ch'ai, Tai-y�, all thesisters and the rest were assigned each a copy of a new book, a fineslab and two pair of gold and silver ornaments of a novel kind andoriginal shape; Pao-y� likewise receiving the same presents. Chia Lan'sgifts consisted of two necklets, one of gold, the other of silver, andof two pair of gold ingots. Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan, lady Feng and theothers had each of them, four ingots of gold and silver; and, in the wayof keepsakes, four pieces of silk. There were, in addition, presentsconsisting of twenty-four pieces of silk and a thousand strings of goodcash to be allotted to the nurses, and waiting-maids, in the apartmentsof dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and of the respective sisters; whileChia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Huan, Chia Jung and the rest had, every one,for presents, a piece of silk, and a pair of gold and silver ingots.
As regards the other gifts, there were a hundred rolls of variouscoloured silks, a thousand ounces of pure silver, and several bottles ofimperial wine, intended to be bestowed upon all the men-servants of themansions, on the East and the West, as well as upon those who had beenin the garden overseeing works, arranging the decorations, and inwaiting to answer calls, and upon those who looked after the theatresand managed the lanterns. There being, besides, five hundred strings ofpure cash for the cooks, waiters, jugglers and hundreds of actors andevery kind of domestic.
The whole party had finished giving expression to their thanks for herbounty, when the managers and eunuchs respectfully announced: "It isalready a quarter to three, and may it please your Majesty to turn backyour imperial chariot;" whereupon, much against her will, the Chiaconsort's eyes brimmed over, and she once more gave vent to tears.Forcing herself however again to put on a smile, she clasped old ladyChia's and madame Wang's hands, and could not bring herself to let themgo; while she repeatedly impressed upon their minds: that there was noneed to give way to any solicitude, and that they should take good careof their healths; that the grace of the present emperor was so vast,that once a month he would grant permission for them to enter the palaceand pay her a visit. "It is easy enough for us to see each other," (shesaid,) "and why should we indulge in any excess of grief? But when hismajesty in his heavenly generosity allows me another time to returnhome, you shouldn't go in for such pomp and extravagance."
Dowager lady Chia and the other inmates had already cried to such anextent that sobs choked their throats and they could with difficultygive utterance to speech. But though the Chia consort could notreconcile herself to the separation, the usages in vogue in the imperialhousehold could not be disregarded or infringed, so that she had noalternative but to stifle the anguish of her heart, to mount herchariot, and take her departure.
The whole family experienced meanwhile a hard task before they succeededin consoling the old lady and madame Wang and in supporting them awayout of the garden. But as what follows is not ascertained, the nextchapter will disclose it.

CHAPTER XIX.
  In the vehemence of her feelings, Hua (Hsi Jen) on a quiet evening      admonishes Pao-y�.  While (the spell) of affection continues unbroken, Pao-y�, on a still      day, perceives the fragrance emitted from Tai-y�'s person.
The Chia consort, we must now go on to explain, returned to the Palace,and the next day, on her appearance in the presence of His Majesty, shethanked him for his bounty and gave him furthermore an account of herexperiences on her visit home. His Majesty's dragon countenance was muchelated, and he also issued from the privy store coloured satins, goldand silver and such like articles to be presented to Chia Cheng and theother officials in the various households of her relatives. Butdispensing with minute details about them, we will now revert to the twomansions of Jung and Ning.
With the extreme strain on mind and body for successive days, thestrength of one and all was, in point of fact, worn out and theirrespective energies exhausted. And it was besides after they had beenputting by the various decorations and articles of use for two or threedays, that they, at length, got through the work.
Lady Feng was the one who had most to do, and whose responsibilitieswere greatest. The others could possibly steal a few leisure moments andretire to rest, while she was the sole person who could not slip away.In the second place, naturally anxious as she was to excel and both tofall in people's estimation, she put up with the strain just as if shewere like one of those who had nothing to attend to. But the one who hadthe least to do and had the most leisure was Pao-y�.
As luck would have it on this day, at an early hour, Hsi Jen's mothercame again in person and told dowager lady Chia that she would take HsiJen home to drink a cup of tea brewed in the new year and that she wouldreturn in the evening. For this reason Pao-y� was only in the company ofall the waiting-maids, throwing dice, playing at chess and amusinghimself. But while he was in the room playing with them with a totalabsence of zest, he unawares perceived a few waiting-maids arrive, whoinformed him that their senior master Mr. Chen, of the Eastern Mansion,had come to invite him to go and see a theatrical performance, and thefireworks, which were to be let off.
Upon hearing these words, Pao-y� speedily asked them to change hisclothes; but just as he was ready to start, presents of cream, steamedwith sugar, arrived again when least expected from the Chia Consort, andPao-y� recollecting with what relish Hsi Jen had partaken of this dishon the last occasion forthwith bid them keep it for her; while he wenthimself and told dowager lady Chia that he was going over to see theplay.
The plays sung over at Chia Chen's consisted, who would have thought it,of "Ting L'ang recognises his father," and "Huang Po-ying deploys thespirits for battle," and in addition to these, "Sung Hsing-che causesgreat commotion in the heavenly palace;" "Ghiang T'ai-kung kills thegeneral and deifies him," and other such like. Soon appeared the spiritsand devils in a confused crowd on the stage, and suddenly also becamevisible the whole band of sprites and goblins, among which were somewaving streamers, as they went past in a procession, invoking Buddha andburning incense. The sound of the gongs and drums and of shouts andcries were audible at a distance beyond the lane; and in the wholestreet, one and all extolled the performance as exceptionally grand, andthat the like could never have been had in the house of any otherfamily.
Pao-y�, noticing that the commotion and bustle had reached a stage sounbearable to his taste, speedily betook himself, after merely sittingfor a little while, to other places in search of relaxation and fun.First of all, he entered the inner rooms, and after spending some timein chatting and laughing with Mrs. Yu, the waiting-maids, and secondarywives, he eventually took his departure out of the second gate; and asMrs. Yu and her companions were still under the impression that he wasgoing out again to see the play, they let him speed on his way, withoutso much as keeping an eye over him.
Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Hs�eh P'an and the others were bent upon guessingenigmas, enforcing the penalties and enjoying themselves in a hundredand one ways, so that even allowing that they had for a moment noticedthat he was not occupying his seat, they must merely have imagined thathe had gone inside and not, in fact, worried their minds about him. Andas for the pages, who had come along with Pao-y�, those who were alittle advanced in years, knowing very well that Pao-y� would, on anoccasion like the present, be sure not to be going before dusk,stealthily therefore took advantage of his absence, those, who could, togamble for money, and others to go to the houses of relatives andfriends to drink of the new year tea, so that what with gambling anddrinking the whole bevy surreptitiously dispersed, waiting for duskbefore they came back; while those, who were younger, had all crept intothe green rooms to watch the excitement; with the result that Pao-y�perceiving not one of them about bethought himself of a small readingroom, which existed in previous days on this side, in which wassuspended a picture of a beauty so artistically executed as to looklife-like. "On such a bustling day as this," he reasoned, "it's prettycertain, I fancy, that there will be no one in there; and that beautifulperson must surely too feel lonely, so that it's only right that Ishould go and console her a bit." With these thoughts, he hastily betookhimself towards the side-house yonder, and as soon as he came up to thewindow, he heard the sound of groans in the room. Pao-y� was reallyquite startled. "What!" (he thought), "can that beautiful girl,possibly, have come to life!" and screwing up his courage, he licked ahole in the paper of the window and peeped in. It was not she, however,who had come to life, but Ming Yen holding down a girl and likewiseindulging in what the Monitory Dream Fairy had taught him.
"Dreadful!" exclaimed Pao-y�, aloud, unable to repress himself, and,stamping one of his feet, he walked into the door to the terror of bothof them, who parting company, shivered with fear, like clothes that arebeing shaken. Ming Yen perceiving that it was Pao-y� promptly fell onhis knees and piteously implored for pardon.
"What! in broad daylight! what do you mean by it? Were your master Mr.Chen to hear of it, would you die or live?" asked Pao-y�, as hesimultaneously cast a glance at the servant-girl, who although not abeauty was anyhow so spick and span, and possessed besides a few charmssufficient to touch the heart. From shame, her face was red and her earspurple, while she lowered her head and uttered not a syllable.
Pao-y� stamped his foot. "What!" he shouted, "don't you yet bundleyourself away!"
This simple remark suggested the idea to the girl's mind who ran off, asif she had wings to fly with; but as Pao-y� went also so far as to go inpursuit of her, calling out: "Don't be afraid, I'm not one to tellanyone," Ming Yen was so exasperated that he cried, as he went afterthem, "My worthy ancestor, this is distinctly telling people about it."
"How old is that servant girl?" Pao-y� having asked; "She's, I expect,no more than sixteen or seventeen," Ming Yen rejoined.
"Well, if you haven't gone so far as to even ascertain her age," Pao-y�observed, "you're sure to know still less about other things; and itmakes it plain enough that her acquaintance with you is all vain andfutile! What a pity! what a pity!"
He then went on to enquire what her name was; and "Were I," continuedMing Yen smiling, "to tell you about her name it would involve a longyarn; it's indeed a novel and strange story! She relates that while hermother was nursing her, she dreamt a dream and obtained in this dreampossession of a piece of brocaded silk, on which were designs, invariegated colours, representing opulence and honour, and a continuousline of the character Wan; and that this reason accounts for the name ofWan Erh, which was given her."
"This is really strange!" Pao-y� exclaimed with a grin, after lending anear to what he had to say; "and she is bound, I think, by and by to havea good deal of good fortune!"
These words uttered, he plunged in deep thought for a while, and MingYen having felt constrained to inquire: "Why aren't you, Mr. Secundus,watching a theatrical performance of this excellent kind?" "I had beenlooking on for ever so long," Pao-y� replied, "until I got quite weary;and had just come out for a stroll, when I happened to meet you two. Butwhat's to be done now?"
Ming Yen gave a faint smile. "As there's no one here to know anythingabout it," he added, "I'll stealthily take you, Mr. Secundus, for a walkoutside the city walls; and we'll come back shortly, before they've gotwind of it."
"That won't do," Pao-y� demurred, "we must be careful, or else somebeggar might kidnap us away; besides, were they to come to hear of it,there'll be again a dreadful row; and isn't it better that we should goto some nearer place, from which we could, after all, return at once?"
"As for some nearer place," Ming Yen observed; "to whose house can wego? It's really no easy matter!"
"My idea is," Pao-y� suggested with a smirk, "that we should simply go,and find sister Hua, and see what she's up to at home."
"Yes! Yes!" Ming Yen replied laughingly; "the fact is I had forgottenall about her home; but should it reach their ears," he continued,"they'll say that it was I who led you, Mr. Secundus, astray, andthey'll beat me!"
"I'm here for you!" Pao-y� having assured him; Ming Yen at these wordsled the horses round, and the two of them speedily made their exit bythe back gate. Luckily Hsi Jen's house was not far off. It was nofurther than half a li's distance, so that in a twinkle they had alreadyreached the front of the door, and Ming Yen was the first to walk in andto call for Hsi Jen's eldest brother Hua Tzu-fang.
Hsi Jen's mother had, on this occasion, united in her home Hsi Jen,several of her sister's daughters, as well as a few of her nieces, andthey were engaged in partaking of fruits and tea, when they heard someone outside call out, "Brother Hua." Hua Tzu-fang lost no time inrushing out; and upon looking and finding that it was the two of them,the master and his servant, he was so taken by surprise that his fearscould not be set at rest. Promptly, he clasped Pao-y� in his arms anddismounted him, and coming into the court, he shouted out at the top ofhis voice: "Mr. Pao has come." The other persons heard the announcementof his arrival, with equanimity, but when it reached Hsi Jen's ears, shetruly felt at such a loss to fathom the object of his visit that issuinghastily out of the room, she came to meet Pao-y�, and as she laid holdof him: "Why did you come?" she asked.
"I felt awfully dull," Pao-y� rejoined with a smile, "and came to seewhat you were up to."
Hsi Jen at these words banished, at last, all anxiety from her mind."You're again up to your larks," she observed, "but what's the aim ofyour visit? Who else has come along with him?" she at the same time wenton to question Ming Yen.
"All the others know nothing about it!" explained Ming Yen exultingly;"only we two do, that's all."
When Hsi Jen heard this remark, she gave way afresh to solicitous fears:"This is dreadful!" she added; "for were you to come across any one fromthe house, or to meet master; or were, in the streets, people to pressagainst you, or horses to collide with you, as to make (his horse) shy,and he were to fall, would that too be a joke? The gall of both of youis larger than a peck measure; but it's all you, Ming Yen, who hasincited him, and when I go back, I'll surely tell the nurses to beatyou."
Ming Yen pouted his mouth. "Mr. Secundus," he pleaded, "abused me andbeat me, as he bade me bring him here, and now he shoves the blame on myshoulders! 'Don't let us go,' I suggested; 'but if you do insist, wellthen let us go and have done.'"
Hua Tzu-fang promptly interceded. "Let things alone," he said; "now thatthey're already here, there's no need whatever of much ado. The onlything is that our mean house with its thatched roof is both so crammedand so filthy that how could you, sir, sit in it!"
Hsi Jen's mother also came out at an early period to receive him, andHsi Jen pulled Pao-y� in. Once inside the room, Pao-y� perceived threeor five girls, who, as soon as they caught sight of him approaching, alllowered their heads, and felt so bashful that their faces were suffusedwith blushes. But as both Hua Tzu-fang and his mother were afraid thatPao-y� would catch cold, they pressed him to take a seat on thestove-bed, and hastened to serve a fresh supply of refreshments, and toat once bring him a cup of good tea.
"You needn't be flurrying all for nothing," Hsi Jen smilinglyinterposed; "I, naturally, should know; and there's no use of evenlaying out any fruits, as I daren't recklessly give him anything toeat."
Saying this, she simultaneously took her own cushion and laid it on astool, and after Pao-y� took a seat on it, she placed the footstove shehad been using, under his feet; and producing, from a satchet, twopeach-blossom-scented small cakes, she opened her own hand-stove andthrew them into the fire; which done, she covered it well again andplaced it in Pao-y�'s lap. And eventually, she filled her own tea-cupwith tea and presented it to Pao-y�, while, during this time, her motherand sister had been fussing about, laying out in fine array a tablefulof every kind of eatables.
Hsi Jen noticed that there were absolutely no things that he could eat,but she felt urged to say with a smile: "Since you've come, it isn'tright that you should go empty away; and you must, whether the things begood or bad, taste a little, so that it may look like a visit to myhouse!"
As she said this, she forthwith took several seeds of the fir-cone, andcracking off the thin skin, she placed them in a handkerchief andpresented them to Pao-y�. But Pao-y�, espying that Hsi Jen's two eyeswere slightly red, and that the powder was shiny and moist, quietlytherefore inquired of Hsi Jen, "Why do you cry for no rhyme or reason?"
"Why should I cry?" Hsi Jen laughed; "something just got into my eyesand I rubbed them." By these means she readily managed to evadedetection; but seeing that Pao-y� wore a deep red archery-sleevedpelisse, ornamented with gold dragons, and lined with fur from foxes'ribs and a grey sable fur surtout with a fringe round the border. "What!have you," she asked, "put on again your new clothes for? specially tocome here? and didn't they inquire of you where you were going?"
"I had changed," Pao-y� explained with a grin, "as Mr. Chen had invitedme to go over and look at the play."
"Well, sit a while and then go back;" Hsi Jen continued as she noddedher head; "for this isn't the place for you to come to!"
"You'd better be going home now," Pao-y� suggested smirkingly; "whereI've again kept something good for you."
"Gently," smiled Hsi Jen, "for were you to let them hear, what figurewould we cut?" And with these, words, she put out her hand andunclasping from Pao-y�'s neck the jade of Spiritual Perception, shefaced her cousins and remarked exultingly. "Here! see for yourselves;look at this and learn! When I repeatedly talked about it, you allthought it extraordinary, and were anxious to have a glance at it;to-day, you may gaze on it with all your might, for whatever preciousthing you may by and by come to see will really never excel such anobject as this!"
When she had finished speaking, she handed it over to them, and afterthey had passed it round for inspection, she again fastened it properlyon Pao-y�'s neck, and also bade her brother go and hire a smallcarriage, or engage a small chair, and escort Pao-y� back home.
"If I see him back," Hua Tzu-fang remarked, "there would be no harm,were he even to ride his horse!"
"It isn't because of harm," Hsi Jen replied; "but because he may comeacross some one from the house."
Hua Tzu-fang promptly went and bespoke a small chair; and when it cameto the door, the whole party could not very well detain him, and they ofcourse had to see Pao-y� out of the house; while Hsi Jen, on the otherhand, snatched a few fruits and gave them to Ming Yen; and as she at thesame time pressed in his hand several cash to buy crackers with to letoff, she enjoined him not to tell any one as he himself would likewiseincur blame.
As she uttered these words, she straightway escorted Pao-y� as far asoutside the door, from whence having seen him mount into the sedanchair, she dropped the curtain; whereupon Ming Yen and her brother, thetwo of them, led the horses and followed behind in his wake. Uponreaching the street where the Ning mansion was situated, Ming Yen toldthe chair to halt, and said to Hua Tzu-fang, "It's advisable that Ishould again go, with Mr. Secundus, into the Eastern mansion, to showourselves before we can safely betake ourselves home; for if we don't,people will suspect!"
Hua Tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said,promptly clasped Pao-y� out of the chair and put him on the horse,whereupon after Pao-y� smilingly remarked: "Excuse me for the troubleI've surely put you to," they forthwith entered again by the back gate;but putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to Pao-y�.
After he had walked out of the door, the several waiting-maids in hisapartments played and laughed with greater zest and with less restraint.Some there were who played at chess, others who threw the dice or had agame of cards; and they covered the whole floor with the shells ofmelon-seeds they were cracking, when dame Li, his nurse, happened tocome in, propping herself on a staff, to pay her respects and to seePao-y�, and perceiving that Pao-y� was not at home and that theservant-girls were only bent upon romping, she felt intensely disgusted."Since I've left this place," she therefore exclaimed with a sigh, "anddon't often come here, you've become more and more unmannerly; while theother nurse does still less than ever venture to expostulate with you;Pao-y� is like a candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light on others,and throwing none upon himself! All he knows is to look down upon peopleas being filthy; and yet this is his room and he allows you to put ittopsy-turvey, and to become more and more unmindful of decorum!"
These servant-girls were well aware that Pao-y� was not particular inthese respects, and that in the next place nurse Li, having pleaded oldage, resigned her place and gone home, had nowadays no control overthem, so that they simply gave their minds to romping and joking, andpaid no heed whatever to her. Nurse Li however still kept on askingabout Pao-y�, "How much rice he now ate at one meal? and at what time hewent to sleep?" to which questions, the servant-girls replied quite atrandom; some there being too who observed: "What a dreadful despicableold thing she is!"
"In this covered bowl," she continued to inquire, "is cream, and why notgive it to me to eat?" and having concluded these words, she took it upand there and then began eating it.
"Be quick, and leave it alone!" a servant-girl expostulated, "that, hesaid, was kept in order to be given to Hsi Jen; and on his return, whenhe again gets into a huff, you, old lady, must, on your own motion,confess to having eaten it, and not involve us in any way as to have tobear his resentment."
Nurse Li, at these words, felt both angry and ashamed. "I can'tbelieve," she forthwith remarked, "that he has become so bad at heart!Not to speak of the milk I've had, I have, in fact every right to evensomething more expensive than this; for is it likely that he holds HsiJen dearer than myself? It can't forsooth be that he doesn't bear inmind how that I've brought him up to be a big man, and how that he haseaten my blood transformed into milk and grown up to this age! and willbe because I'm now having a bowl of milk of his be angry on that score!I shall, yes, eat it, and we'll see what he'll do! I don't know what youpeople think of Hsi Jen, but she was a lowbred girl, whom I've with myown hands raised up! and what fine object indeed was she!"
As she spoke, she flew into a temper, and taking the cream she drank thewhole of it.
"They don't know how to speak properly!" another servant-girl interposedsarcastically, "and it's no wonder that you, old lady, should get angry!Pao-y� still sends you, venerable dame, presents as a proof of hisgratitude, and is it possible that he will feel displeased for such athing like this?"
"You girls shouldn't also pretend to be artful flatterers to cajole me!"nurse Li added; "do you imagine that I'm not aware of the dismissal, theother day, of Hsi Hs�eh, on account of a cup of tea? and as it's clearenough that I've incurred blame, I'll come by and by and receive it!"
Having said this, she went off in a dudgeon, but not a long intervalelapsed before Pao-y� returned, and gave orders to go and fetch Hsi Jen;and perceiving Ching Ling reclining on the bed perfectly still: "Ipresume she's ill," Pao-y� felt constrained to inquire, "or if she isn'till, she must have lost at cards."
"Not so!" observed Chiu Wen; "she had been a winner, but dame Li came inquite casually and muddled her so that she lost; and angry at this sherushed off to sleep."
"Don't place yourselves," Pao-y� smiled, "on the same footing as nurseLi, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right."
These words were still on his lips when Hsi Jen arrived. After themutual salutations, Hsi Jen went on to ask of Pao-y�: "Where did youhave your repast? and what time did you come back?" and to presentlikewise, on behalf of her mother and sister, her compliments to all thegirls, who were her companions. In a short while, she changed hercostume and divested herself of her fineries, and Pao-y� bade them fetchthe cream.
"Nurse Li has eaten it," the servant-girls rejoined, and as Pao-y� wason the point of making some remark Hsi Jen hastened to interfere,laughing the while; "Is it really this that you had kept for me? manythanks for the trouble; the other day, when I had some, I found it verytoothsome, but after I had partaken of it, I got a pain in the stomach,and was so much upset, that it was only after I had brought it all upthat I felt all right. So it's as well that she has had it, for, had itbeen kept here, it would have been wasted all for no use! What I fancyare dry chestnuts; and while you clean a few for me, I'll go and lay thebed!"
Pao-y� upon hearing these words credited them as true, so that hediscarded all thought of the cream and fetched the chestnuts, which he,with his own hands, selected and pealed. Perceiving at the same timethat none of the party were present in the room, he put on a smile andinquired of Hsi Jen: "Who were those persons dressed in red to day?"
"They're my two cousins on my mother's side," Hsi Jen explained, andhearing this, Pao-y� sang their praise as he heaved a couple of sighs.
"What are you sighing for?" Hsi Jen remarked. "I know the secret reasonsof your heart; it's I fancy because she isn't fit to wear red!"
"It isn't that," Pao-y� protested smilingly, "it isn't that; if such aperson as that isn't good enough to be dressed in red, who wouldforsooth presume to wear it? It's because I find her so really lovely!and if we could, after all, manage to get her into our family, how niceit would be then!"
Hsi Jen gave a sardonic smile. "That it's my own fate to be a slavedoesn't matter, but is it likely that the destiny of even my veryrelatives could be to become one and all of them bond servants? But youshould certainly set your choice upon some really beautiful girl, forshe would in that case be good enough to enter your house."
"Here you are again with your touchiness!" Pao-y� eagerly exclaimedsmiling, "if I said that she should come to our house, does itnecessarily imply that she should be a servant? and wouldn't it do wereI to mention that she should come as a relative!"
"That too couldn't exalt her to be a fit match for you!" rejoined HsiJen; but Pao-y� being loth to continue the conversation, simply busiedhimself with cleaning the chestnuts.
"How is it you utter not a word?" Hsi Jen laughed; "I expect it'sbecause I just offended you by my inconsiderate talk! But if by and byyou have your purpose fixed on it, just spend a few ounces of silver topurchase them with, and bring them in and have done!"
"How would you have one make any reply?" Pao-y� smilingly rejoined; "allI did was to extol her charms; for she's really fit to have been born ina deep hall and spacious court as this; and it isn't for such foulthings as myself and others to contrariwise spend our days in thisplace!"
"Though deprived of this good fortune," Hsi Jen explained, "she'snevertheless also petted and indulged and the jewel of my maternal uncleand my aunt! She's now seventeen years of age, and everything in the wayof trousseau has been got ready, and she's to get married next year."
Upon hearing the two words "get married," he could not repress himselffrom again ejaculating: "Hai hai!" but while he was in an unhappy frameof mind, he once more heard Hsi Jen remark as she heaved a sigh: "Eversince I've come here, we cousins haven't all these years been able toget to live together, and now that I'm about to return home, they, onthe other hand, will all be gone!"
Pao-y�, realising that there lurked in this remark some meaning orother, was suddenly so taken aback that dropping the chestnuts, heinquired: "How is it that you now want to go back?"
"I was present to-day," Hsi Jen explained, "when mother and brother heldconsultation together, and they bade me be patient for another year, andthat next year they'll come up and redeem me out of service!"
Pao-y�, at these words, felt the more distressed. "Why do they want toredeem you?" he consequently asked.
"This is a strange question!" Hsi Jen retorted, "for I can't really betreated as if I were the issue born in this homestead of yours! All themembers of my family are elsewhere, and there's only myself in thisplace, so that how could I end my days here?"
"If I don't let you go, it will verily be difficult for you to getaway!" Pao-y� replied.
"There has never been such a principle of action!" urged Hsi Jen; "evenin the imperial palace itself, there's a fixed rule, by which possiblyevery certain number of years a selection (of those who have to go takesplace), and every certain number of years a new batch enters; andthere's no such practice as that of keeping people for ever; not tospeak of your own home."
Pao-y� realised, after reflection, that she, in point of fact, wasright, and he went on to observe: "Should the old lady not give you yourrelease, it will be impossible for you to get off."
"Why shouldn't she release me?" Hsi Jen questioned. "Am I really so veryextraordinary a person as to have perchance made such an impression uponher venerable ladyship and my lady that they will be positive in notletting me go? They may, in all likelihood, give my family some moreounces of silver to keep me here; that possibly may come about. But, intruth, I'm also a person of the most ordinary run, and there are manymore superior to me, yea very many! Ever since my youth up, I've been inher old ladyship's service; first by waiting upon Miss Shih for severalyears, and recently by being in attendance upon you for another term ofyears; and now that our people will come to redeem me, I should, as amatter of right, be told to go. My idea is that even the very redemptionmoney won't be accepted, and that they will display such grace as to letme go at once. And, as for being told that I can't be allowed to go asI'm so diligent in my service to you, that's a thing that can on noaccount come about! My faithful attendance is an obligation of myduties, and is no exceptional service! and when I'm gone you'll againhave some other faithful attendant, and it isn't likely that when I'm nomore here, you'll find it impracticable to obtain one!"
After Pao-y� had listened to these various arguments, which proved thereasonableness of her going and the unreasonableness of any detention,he felt his heart more than ever a prey to distress. "In spite of allyou say," he therefore continued, "the sole desire of my heart is todetain you; and I have no doubt but that the old lady will speak to yourmother about it; and if she were to give your mother ample money,she'll, of course, not feel as if she could very well with any decencytake you home!"
"My mother won't naturally have the audacity to be headstrong!" Hsi Jenventured, "not to speak besides of the nice things, which may be toldher and the lots of money she may, in addition, be given; but were sheeven not to be paid any compliments, and not so much as a single cashgiven her, she won't, if you set your mind upon keeping me here, presumenot to comply with your wishes, were it also against my inclination. Onething however; our family would never rely upon prestige, and trust uponhonorability to do anything so domineering as this! for this isn't likeanything else, which, because you take a fancy to it, a hundred per centprofit can be added, and it obtained for you! This action can be welltaken if the seller doesn't suffer loss! But in the present instance,were they to keep me back for no rhyme or reason, it would also be of nobenefit to yourself; on the contrary, they would be instrumental inkeeping us blood relatives far apart; a thing the like of which, I feelpositive that dowager lady Chia and my lady will never do!"
After lending an ear to this argument, Pao-y� cogitated within himselffor a while. "From what you say," he then observed, "when you say you'llgo, it means that you'll go for certain!"
"Yes, that I'll go for certain," Hsi Jen rejoined.
"Who would have anticipated," Pao-y�, after these words, mused in hisown heart, "that a person like her would have shown such little sense ofgratitude, and such a lack of respect! Had I," he then remarked aloudwith a sigh, "been aware, at an early date, that your whole wish wouldhave been to go, I wouldn't, in that case, have brought you over! Butwhen you're away, I shall remain alone, a solitary spirit!"
As he spoke, he lost control over his temper, and, getting into bed, hewent to sleep.
The fact is that when Hsi Jen had been at home, and she heard her motherand brother express their intention of redeeming her back, she there andthen observed that were she even at the point of death, she would notreturn home. "When in past days," she had argued, "you had no rice toeat, there remained myself, who was still worth several taels; andhadn't I urged you to sell me, wouldn't I have seen both father andmother die of starvation under my very eyes? and you've now had the goodfortune of selling me into this place, where I'm fed and clothed justlike a mistress, and where I'm not beaten by day, nor abused by night!Besides, though now father be no more, you two have anyhow by puttingthings straight again, so adjusted the family estate that it has resumedits primitive condition. And were you, in fact, still in straitenedcircumstances, and you could by redeeming me back, make again some moremoney, that would be well and good; but the truth is that there's nosuch need, and what would be the use for you to redeem me at such a timeas this? You should temporarily treat me as dead and gone, and shouldn'tagain recall any idea of redeeming me!"
Having in consequence indulged in a loud fit of crying, her mother andbrother resolved, when they perceived her in this determined frame ofmind, that for a fact there was no need for her to come out of service.What is more they had sold her under contract until death, in thedistinct reliance that the Chia family, charitable and generous a familyas it was, would, possibly, after no more than a few entreaties, makethem a present of her person as well as the purchase money. In thesecond place, never had they in the Chia mansion ill-used any of thosebelow; there being always plenty of grace and little of imperiousness.Besides, the servant-girls, who acted as personal attendants in theapartments of the old as well as of the young, were treated so farunlike the whole body of domestics in the household that the daughterseven of an ordinary and penniless parentage could not have been solooked up to. And these considerations induced both the mother as wellas her son to at once dispel the intention and not to redeem her, andwhen Pao-y� had subsequently paid them an unexpected visit, and the twoof them (Pao-y� and Hsi Jen) were seen to be also on such terms, themother and her son obtained a clearer insight into their relations, andstill one more burden (which had pressed on their mind) fell to theground, and as besides this was a contingency, which they had neverreckoned upon, they both composed their hearts, and did not againentertain any idea of ransoming her.
It must be noticed moreover that Hsi Jen had ever since her youth notbeen blind to the fact that Pao-y� had an extraordinary temperament,that he was self-willed and perverse, far even in excess of all younglads, and that he had, in addition, a good many peculiarities and manyunspeakable defects. And as of late he had placed such reliance in thefond love of his grandmother that his father and mother even could notexercise any extreme control over him, he had become so much the moreremiss, dissolute, selfish and unconcerned, not taking the leastpleasure in what was proper, that she felt convinced, whenever sheentertained the idea of tendering him advice, that he would not listento her. On this day, by a strange coincidence, came about the discussionrespecting her ransom, and she designedly made use, in the firstinstance, of deception with a view to ascertain his feelings, tosuppress his temper, and to be able subsequently to extend to him somewords of admonition; and when she perceived that Pao-y� had now silentlygone to sleep, she knew that his feelings could not brook the idea ofher return and that his temper had already subsided. She had never had,as far as she was concerned, any desire of eating chestnuts, but as shefeared lest, on account of the cream, some trouble might arise, whichmight again lead to the same results as when Hsi Hs�eh drank the tea,she consequently made use of the pretence that she fancied chestnuts, inorder to put off Pao-y� from alluding (to the cream) and to bring thematter speedily to an end. But telling forthwith the young waiting-maidsto take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushedPao-y�; but at the sight of Pao-y� with the traces of tears on his face,she at once put on a smiling expression and said: "What's there in thisto wound your heart? If you positively do wish to keep me, I shall, ofcourse, not go away!"
Pao-y� noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, andreadily observed: "Do go on and tell me what else I can do to succeed inkeeping you here, for of my own self I find it indeed difficult to sayhow!"
"Of our friendliness all along," Hsi Jen smilingly rejoined, "there'snaturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mindto retain me here, it isn't through this friendship that you'll succeedin doing so. But I'll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and,if you really do accede to my wishes, you'll then have shown an earnestdesire to keep me here, and I won't go, were even a sword to be laid onmy neck!"
"Do tell me what these conditions are," Pao-y� pressed her withalacrity, as he smiled, "and I'll assent to one and all. My dear sister,my own dear sister, not to speak of two or three, but even two or threehundred of them I'm quite ready to accept. All I entreat you is that youand all of you should combine to watch over me and take care of me,until some day when I shall be transformed into flying ashes; but flyingashes are, after all, not opportune, as they have form and substance andthey likewise possess sense, but until I've been metamorphosed into astreak of subtle smoke. And when the wind shall have with one puffdispelled me, all of you then will be unable to attend to me, just asmuch as I myself won't be able to heed you. You will, when that timecomes, let me go where I please, as I'll let you speed where you chooseto go!"
These words so harassed Hsi Jen that she hastened to put her hand overhis mouth. "Speak decently," she said; "I was on account of this justabout to admonish you, and now here you are uttering all this still moreloathsome trash."
"I won't utter these words again," Pao-y� eagerly added.
"This is the first fault that you must change," Hsi Jen replied.
"I'll amend," Pao-y� observed, "and if I say anything of the kind againyou can wring my mouth; but what else is there?"
"The second thing is this," Hsi Jen explained; "whether you really liketo study or whether you only pretend to like study is immaterial; butyou should, when you are in the presence of master, or in the presenceof any one else, not do nothing else than find fault with people andmake fun of them, but behave just as if you were genuinely fond ofstudy, so that you shouldn't besides provoke your father so much toanger, and that he should before others have also a chance of sayingsomething! 'In my family,' he reflects within himself, 'generation aftergeneration has been fond of books, but ever since I've had you, youhaven't accomplished my expectations, and not only is it that you don'tcare about reading books,'--and this has already filled his heart withanger and vexation,--'but both before my face and behind my back, youutter all that stuff and nonsense, and give those persons, who have,through their knowledge of letters, attained high offices, the nicknameof the "the salaried worms." You also uphold that there's no workexclusive (of the book where appears) "fathom spotless virtue;" and thatall other books consist of foolish compilations, which owe their originto former authors, who, unable themselves to expound the writings ofConfucius, readily struck a new line and invented original notions.' Nowwith words like these, how can one wonder if master loses all patience,and if he does from time to time give you a thrashing! and what do youmake other people think of you?"
"I won't say these things again," Pao-y� laughingly protested, "theseare the reckless and silly absurdities of a time when I was young andhad no idea of the height of the heavens and the thickness of the earth;but I'll now no more repeat them. What else is there besides?"
"It isn't right that you should sneer at the bonzes and vilify theTaoist priests, nor mix cosmetics or prepare rouge," Hsi Jen continued;"but there's still another thing more important, you shouldn't againindulge the bad habits of licking the cosmetic, applied by people ontheir lips, nor be fond of (girls dressed) in red!"
"I'll change in all this," Pao-y� added by way of rejoinder; "I'llchange in all this; and if there's anything more be quick and tell me."
"There's nothing more," Hsi Jen observed; "but you must in everythingexercise a little more diligence, and not indulge your caprices andallow your wishes to run riot, and you'll be all right. And should youcomply to all these things in real earnest, you couldn't carry me out,even in a chair with eight bearers."
"Well, if you do stay in here long enough," Pao-y� remarked with asmile, "there's no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair tosit in!"
Hsi Jen gave a sardonic grin. "I don't care much about it," she replied;"and were I even to have such good fortune, I couldn't enjoy such aright. But allowing I could sit in one, there would be no pleasure init!"
While these two were chatting, they saw Ch'iu Wen walk in. "It's thethird watch of the night," she observed, "and you should go to sleep.Just a few moments back your grandmother lady Chia and our lady sent anurse to ask about you, and I replied that you were asleep."
Pao-y� bade her fetch a watch, and upon looking at the time, he foundindeed that the hand was pointing at ten; whereupon rinsing his mouthagain and loosening his clothes, he retired to rest, where we will leavehim without any further comment.
The next day, Hsi Jen got up as soon as it was dawn, feeling her bodyheavy, her head sore, her eyes swollen, and her limbs burning like fire.She managed however at first to keep up, an effort though it was, but assubsequently she was unable to endure the strain, and all she feltdisposed to do was to recline, she therefore lay down in her clothes onthe stove-couch. Pao-y� hastened to tell dowager lady Chia, and thedoctor was sent for, who, upon feeling her pulse and diagnosing hercomplaint, declared that there was nothing else the matter with her thana chill, which she had suddenly contracted, that after she had taken adose or two of medicine, it would be dispelled, and that she would bequite well. After he had written the prescription and taken hisdeparture, some one was despatched to fetch the medicines, which whenbrought were properly decocted. As soon as she had swallowed a dose,Pao-y� bade her cover herself with her bed-clothes so as to bring onperspiration; while he himself came into Tai-y�'s room to look her up.Tai-y� was at this time quite alone, reclining on her bed having amidday siesta, and the waiting-maids having all gone out to attend towhatever they pleased, the whole room was plunged in stillness andsilence. Pao-y� raised the embroidered soft thread portiere and walkedin; and upon espying Tai-y� in the room fast asleep, he hurriedlyapproached her and pushing her: "Dear cousin," he said, "you've just hadyour meal, and are you asleep already?" and he kept on calling "Tai-y�"till he woke her out of her sleep.
Perceiving that it was Pao-y�, "You had better go for a stroll," Tai-y�urged, "for the day before yesterday I was disturbed the whole night,and up to this day I haven't had rest enough to get over the fatigue. Mywhole body feels languid and sore."
"This languor and soreness," Pao-y� rejoined, "are of no consequence;but if you go on sleeping you'll be feeling very ill; so I'll try anddistract you, and when we've dispelled this lassitude, you'll be allright."
Tai-y� closed her eyes. "I don't feel any lassitude," she explained,"all I want is a little rest; and you had better go elsewhere and comeback after romping about for a while."
"Where can I go?" Pao-y� asked as he pushed her. "I'm quite sick andtired of seeing the others."
At these words, Tai-y� burst out laughing with a sound of Ch'ih. "Well!since you wish to remain here," she added, "go over there and sit downquietly, and let's have a chat."
"I'll also recline," Pao-y� suggested.
"Well, then, recline!" Tai-y� assented.
"There's no pillow," observed Pao-y�, "so let us lie on the samepillow."
"What nonsense!" Tai-y� urged, "aren't those pillows outside? get oneand lie on it."
Pao-y� walked into the outer apartment, and having looked about him, hereturned and remarked with a smile: "I don't want those, they may be,for aught I know, some dirty old hag's."
Tai-y� at this remark opened her eyes wide, and as she raised herselfup: "You're really," she exclaimed laughingly, "the evil star of myexistence! here, please recline on this pillow!" and as she utteredthese words, she pushed her own pillow towards Pao-y�, and, getting upshe went and fetched another of her own, upon which she lay her head insuch a way that both of them then reclined opposite to each other. ButTai-y�, upon turning up her eyes and looking, espied on Pao-y�'s cheekon the left side of his face, a spot of blood about the size of abutton, and speedily bending her body, she drew near to him, and rubbingit with her hand, she scrutinised it closely. "Whose nail," she went onto inquire, "has scratched this open?"
Pao-y� with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as hedid so, he answered with a smile: "It isn't a scratch; it must, Ipresume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when I was justnow mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them."
Saying this, he tried to get at his handkerchief to wipe it off; butTai-y� used her own and rubbed it clean for him, while she observed: "Doyou still give your mind to such things? attend to them you may; butmust you carry about you a placard (to make it public)? Though unclemayn't see it, were others to notice it, they would treat it as astrange occurrence and a novel bit of news, and go and tell him to curryfavour, and when it has reached uncle's ear, we shall all again not comeout clean, and provoke him to anger."
Pao-y� did not in the least heed what she said, being intent uponsmelling a subtle scent which, in point of fact, emanated from Tai-y�'ssleeve, and when inhaled inebriated the soul and paralysed the bones.With a snatch, Pao-y� laid hold of Tai-y�'s sleeve meaning to see whatobject was concealed in it; but Tai-y� smilingly expostulated: "At sucha time as this," she said, "who keeps scents about one?"
"Well, in that case," Pao-y� rejoined with a smirking face, "where doesthis scent come from?"
"I myself don't know," Tai-y� replied; "I presume it must be, there's nosaying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes."
"It doesn't follow," Pao-y� added, as he shook his head; "the fumes ofthis smell are very peculiar, and don't resemble the perfume ofscent-bottles, scent-balls, or scented satchets!"
"Is it likely that I have, like others, Buddhistic disciples," Tai-y�asked laughing ironically, "or worthies to give me novel kinds ofscents? But supposing there is about me some peculiar scent, I haven't,at all events, any older or younger brothers to get the flowers, buds,dew, and snow, and concoct any for me; all I have are those commonscents, that's all."
"Whenever I utter any single remark," Pao-y� urged with a grin, "you atonce bring up all these insinuations; but unless I deal with youseverely, you'll never know what stuff I'm made of; but from henceforthI'll no more show you any grace!"
As he spoke, he turned himself over, and raising himself, he puffed acouple of breaths into both his hands, and hastily stretching them out,he tickled Tai-y� promiscuously under her armpits, and along both sides.Tai-y� had never been able to stand tickling, so that when Pao-y� putout his two hands and tickled her violently, she forthwith giggled tosuch an extent that she could scarcely gasp for breath. "If you still goon teasing me," she shouted, "I'll get angry with you!"
Pao-y� then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, "Tell me," he asked,"will you again come out with all those words or not?"
"I daren't do it again," Tai-y� smiled and adjusted her hair; addingwith another laugh: "I may have peculiar scents, but have you any 'warm'scents?"
Pao-y� at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: "What'warm' scent?" he therefore asked.
Tai-y� nodded her head and smiled deridingly. "How stupid! what a fool!"she sighed; "you have jade, and another person has gold to match withyou, and if some one has 'cold' scent, haven't you any 'warm' scent as aset-off?"
Pao-y� at this stage alone understood the import of her remark.
"A short while back you craved for mercy," Pao-y� observed smilingly,"and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;" and as he spokehe again put out his hands.
"Dear cousin," Tai-y� speedily implored with a smirk, "I won't ventureto do it again."
"As for letting you off," Pao-y� remarked laughing, "I'll readily letyou off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!" and whileuttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing itagainst his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon Tai-y� drewher hand away and urged: "You must be going now!"
"Though you may wish me to go, I can't," Pao-y� smiled, "so let us nowlie down with all propriety and have a chat," laying himself down again,as he spoke, while Tai-y� likewise reclined, and covered her face withher handkerchief. Pao-y� in a rambling way gave vent to a lot ofnonsense, which Tai-y� did not heed, and Pao-y� went on to inquire: "Howold she was when she came to the capital? what sights and antiquitiesshe saw on the journey? what relics and curiosities there were at YangChou? what were the local customs and the habits of the people?"
Tai-y� made no reply; and Pao-y� fearing lest she should go to sleep,and get ill, readily set to work to beguile her to keep awake. "Ai yah!"he exclaimed, "at Yang Chou, where your official residence is, hasoccurred a remarkable affair; have you heard about it?"
Tai-y� perceiving that he spoke in earnest, that his words were correctand his face serious, imagined that what he referred to was a truestory, and she therefore inquired what it was?
Pao-y� upon hearing her ask this question, forthwith suppressed a laugh,and, with a glib tongue, he began to spin a yarn. "At Yang Chou," hesaid, "there's a hill called the Tai hill; and on this hill stands acave called the Lin Tzu."
"This must all be lies," Tai-y� answered sneeringly, "as I've neverbefore heard of such a hill."
"Under the heavens many are the hills and rivers," Pao-y� rejoined, "andhow could you know them all? Wait until I've done speaking, when youwill be free to express your opinion!"
"Go on then," Tai-y� suggested, whereupon Pao-y� prosecuted hisraillery. "In this Lin Tzu cave," he said, "there was once upon a time awhole swarm of rat-elves. In some year or other and on the seventh dayof the twelfth moon, an old rat ascended the throne to discuss matters.'Tomorrow,' he argued, 'is the eighth of the twelfth moon, and men inthe world will all be cooking the congee of the eighth of the twelfthmoon. We have now in our cave a short supply of fruits of all kinds, andit would be well that we should seize this opportunity to steal a fewand bring them over.' Drawing a mandatory arrow, he handed it to asmall rat, full of aptitude, to go forward on a tour of inspection. Theyoung rat on his return reported that he had already concluded hissearch and inquiries in every place and corner, and that in the templeat the bottom of the hill alone was the largest stock of fruits andrice. 'How many kinds of rice are there?' the old rat ascertained, 'andhow many species of fruits?' 'Rice and beans,' the young rat rejoined,'how many barns-full there are, I can't remember; but in the way offruits there are five kinds: 1st, red dates; 2nd, chestnuts; 3rd, groundnuts; 4th, water caltrops, and 5th, scented taros.' At this report theold rat was so much elated that he promptly detailed rats to go forth;and as he drew the mandatory arrow, and inquired who would go and stealthe rice, a rat readily received the order and went off to rob the rice.Drawing another mandatory arrow, he asked who would go and abstract thebeans, when once more a rat took over the arrow and started to steal thebeans; and one by one subsequently received each an arrow and started onhis errand. There only remained the scented taros, so that picking againa mandatory arrow, he ascertained who would go and carry away the taros:whereupon a very puny and very delicate rat was heard to assent. 'Iwould like,' he said, 'to go and steal the scented taros.' The old ratand all the swarm of rats, upon noticing his state, feared that he wouldnot be sufficiently expert, and apprehending at the same time that hewas too weakly and too devoid of energy, they one and all would notallow him to proceed. 'Though I be young in years and though my frame bedelicate,' the wee rat expostulated, 'my devices are unlimited, my talkis glib and my designs deep and farseeing; and I feel convinced that, onthis errand, I shall be more ingenious in pilfering than any of them.''How could you be more ingenious than they?' the whole company of ratsasked. 'I won't,' explained the young rat, 'follow their example, and gostraight to work and steal, but by simply shaking my body, andtransforming myself, I shall metamorphose myself into a taro, and rollmyself among the heap of taros, so that people will not be able todetect me, and to hear me; whereupon I shall stealthily, by means of themagic art of dividing my body into many, begin the removal, and littleby little transfer the whole lot away, and will not this be far moreingenious than any direct pilfering or forcible abstraction?' After thewhole swarm of rats had listened to what he had to say, they, with onevoice, exclaimed: 'Excellent it is indeed, but what is this art ofmetamorphosis we wonder? Go forth you may, but first transform yourselfand let us see you.' At these words the young rat laughed. 'This isn't ahard task!' he observed, 'wait till I transform myself.'
"Having done speaking, he shook his body and shouted out 'transform,'when he was converted into a young girl, most beauteous and with a mostlovely face.
"'You've transformed yourself into the wrong thing,' all the ratspromptly added deridingly; 'you said that you were to become a fruit,and how is it that you've turned into a young lady?'
"The young rat in its original form rejoined with a sneering smile: 'Youall lack, I maintain, experience of the world; what you simply are awareof is that this fruit is the scented taro, but have no idea that theyoung daughter of Mr. Lin, of the salt tax, is, in real truth, a genuinescented taro.'"
Tai-y� having listened to this story, turned herself round and raisingherself, she observed laughing, while she pushed Pao-y�: "I'll take thatmouth of yours and pull it to pieces! Now I see that you've beenimposing upon me."
With these words on her lips, she readily gave him a pinch, and Pao-y�hastened to plead for mercy. "My dear cousin," he said, "spare me; Iwon't presume to do it again; and it's when I came to perceive thisperfume of yours, that I suddenly bethought myself of this old story."
"You freely indulge in abusing people," Tai-y� added with a smile, "andthen go on to say that it's an old story."
But hardly had she concluded this remark before they caught sight ofPao-ch'ai walk in. "Who has been telling old stories?" she asked with abeaming face; "do let me also hear them."
Tai-y� pressed her at once into a seat. "Just see for yourself who elsebesides is here!" she smiled; "he goes in for profuse abuses and thenmaintains that it's an old story!"
"Is it indeed cousin Pao-y�?" Pao-ch'ai remarked. "Well, one can't feelsurprised at his doing it; for many have ever been the stories stored upin his brain. The only pity is that when he should make use of oldstories, he invariably forgets them! To-day, he can easily enough recallthem to mind, but in the stanza of the other night on the banana leaves,when he should have remembered them, he couldn't after all recollectwhat really stared him in the face! and while every one else seemed socool, he was in such a flurry that he actually perspired! And yet, atthis moment, he happens once again to have a memory!"
At these words, Tai-y� laughed. "O-mi-to-fu!" she exclaimed. "You areindeed my very good cousin! But you've also (to Pao-y�) come across yourmatch. And this makes it clear that requital and retribution never failor err."
She had just reached this part of her sentence, when in Pao-y�'s roomswas heard a continuous sound of wrangling; but as what transpired is notyet known, the ensuing chapter will explain.

CHAPTER XX.
  Wang Hsi-feng with earnest words upbraids Mrs. Chao's jealous notions.  Lin Tai-y� uses specious language to make sport of Shih Hsiang-y�n's      querulous tone of voice.
But to continue. Pao-y� was in Tai y�'s apartments relating about therat-elves, when Pao-ch'ai entered unannounced, and began to gibe Pao-y�,with trenchant irony: how that on the fifteenth of the first moon, hehad shown ignorance of the allusion to the green wax; and the three ofthem then indulged in that room in mutual poignant satire, for the sakeof fun. Pao-y� had been giving way to solicitude lest Tai-y� should, bybeing bent upon napping soon after her meal, be shortly getting anindigestion, or lest sleep should, at night, be completely dispelled, asneither of these things were conducive to the preservation of goodhealth, when luckily Pao-ch'ai walked in, and they chatted and laughedtogether; and when Lin Tai-y� at length lost all inclination to dose, hehimself then felt composed in his mind. But suddenly they heardclamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear andlistened, Lin Tai-y� was the first to smile and make a remark. "It'syour nurse having a row with Hsi Jen!" she said. "Hsi Jen treats herwell enough, but that nurse of yours would also like to keep her wellunder her thumb; she's indeed an old dotard;" and Pao-y� was anxious togo over at once, but Pao-ch'ai laid hold of him and kept him back,suggesting: "It's as well that you shouldn't wrangle with your nurse,for she's quite stupid from old age; and it's but fair, on the contrary,that you should bear with her a little."
"I know all about that!" Pao-y� rejoined. But having concluded thisremark, he walked into his room, where he discovered nurse Li, leaningon her staff, standing in the centre of the floor, abusing Hsi Jen,saying: "You young wench! how utterly unmindful you are of your origin!It's I who've raised you up, and yet, when I came just now, you put onhigh airs and mighty side, and remained reclining on the stove-couch!You saw me well enough, but you paid not the least heed to me! Yourwhole heart is set upon acting like a wily enchantress to befool Pao-y�;and you so impose upon Pao-y� that he doesn't notice me, but merelylends an ear to what you people have to say! You're no more than a lowgirl bought for a few taels and brought in here; and will it ever dothat you should be up to your mischievous tricks in this room? Butwhether you like it or not, I'll drag you out from this, and give you tosome mean fellow, and we'll see whether you will still behave like avery imp, and cajole people or not?"
Hsi Jen was, at first, under the simple impression that the nurse waswrath for no other reason than because she remained lying down, and shefelt constrained to explain that "she was unwell, that she had justsucceeded in perspiring, and that having had her head covered, shehadn't really perceived the old lady;" but when she came subsequently tohear her mention that she imposed upon Pao-y�, and also go so far as toadd that she would be given to some mean fellow, she unavoidablyexperienced both a sense of shame and injury, and found it impossible torestrain herself from beginning to cry.
Pao-y� had, it is true, caught all that had been said, but unable withany propriety to take notice of it, he thought it his duty to explainmatters for her. "She's ill," he observed, "and is taking medicines; andif you don't believe it," he went on, "well then ask the rest of theservant-girls."
Nurse Li at these words flew into a more violent dudgeon. "Your soledelight is to screen that lot of sly foxes!" she remarked, "and do youpay any notice to me? No, none at all! and whom would you like me to goand ask; who's it that doesn't back you? and who hasn't been dismountedfrom her horse by Hsi Jen? I know all about it; but I'll go with you andexplain all these matters to our old mistress and my lady; for I'venursed you till I've brought you to this age, and now that you don'tfeed on milk, you thrust me on one side, and avail yourself of theservant-girls, in your wish to browbeat me."
As she uttered this remark, she too gave way to tears, but by this time,Tai-y� and Pao-ch'ai had also come over, and they set to work toreassure her. "You, old lady," they urged, "should bear with them alittle, and everything will be right!" And when nurse Li saw these twoarrive, she hastened to lay bare her grievances to them; and taking upthe question of the dismissal in days gone by, of Hsi Hs�eh, for havingdrunk some tea, of the cream eaten on the previous day, and othersimilar matters, she spun a long, interminable yarn.
By a strange coincidence lady Feng was at this moment in the upperrooms, where she had been making up the account of losses and winnings,and upon hearing at the back a continuous sound of shouting andbustling, she readily concluded that nurse Li's old complaint wasbreaking forth, and that she was finding fault with Pao-y�'s servants.But she had, as luck would have it, lost money in gambling on thisoccasion, so that she was ready to visit her resentment upon others.With hurried step, she forthwith came over, and laying hold of nurse Li,"Nurse," she said smiling, "don't lose your temper, on a great festivallike this, and after our venerable lady has just gone through a day inexcellent spirits! You're an old dame, and should, when others get up arow, still do what is right and keep them in proper order; and aren'tyou, instead of that, aware what good manners imply, that you will startvociferating in this place, and make our dowager lady full ofdispleasure? Tell me who's not good, and I'll beat her for you; but bequick and come along with me over to my quarters, where a pheasant whichthey have roasted is scalding hot, and let us go and have a glass ofwine!" And as she spoke, she dragged her along and went on her way."Feng Erh," she also called, "hold the staff for your old lady Li, andthe handkerchief to wipe her tears with!" While nurse Li walked alongwith lady Feng, her feet scarcely touched the ground, as she kept onsaying: "I don't really attach any value to this decrepid existence ofmine! and I had rather disregard good manners, have a row and lose face,as it's better, it seems to me, than to put up with the temper of thatwench!"
Behind followed Pao-ch'ai and Tai-y�, and at the sight of the way inwhich lady Feng dealt with her, they both clapped their hands, andexclaimed, laughing, "What piece of luck that this gust of wind hascome, and dragged away this old matron!" while Pao-y� nodded his head toand fro and soliloquised with a sigh: "One can neither know whenceoriginates this score; for she will choose the weak one to maltreat; norcan one see what girl has given her offence that she has come to be putin her black books!"
Scarcely had he ended this remark, before Ch'ing Wen, who stood by, putin her word. "Who's gone mad again?" she interposed, "and what goodwould come by hurting her feelings? But did even any one happen to hurther, she would have pluck enough to bear the brunt, and wouldn't act soimproperly as to involve others!"
Hsi Jen wept, and as she, did so, she drew Pao-y� towards her: "Allthrough my having aggrieved an old nurse," she urged, "you've now againgiven umbrage, entirely on my account, to this crowd of people; andisn't this still enough for me to bear but must you also go and drag inthird parties?"
When Pao-y� realised that to this sickness of hers, had also beensuperadded all these annoyances, he promptly stifled his resentment,suppressed his voice and consoled her so far as to induce her to liedown again to perspire. And when he further noticed how scalding likesoup and burning like fire she was, he himself watched by her, andreclining by her side, he tried to cheer her, saying: "All you must dois to take good care of your ailment; and don't give your mind to thosetrifling matters, and get angry."
"Were I," Hsi Jen smiled sardonically, "to lose my temper over suchconcerns, would I be able to stand one moment longer in this room? Theonly thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing elsethan clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? But yourashly go and hurt people's feelings for our sakes; but they'll bear itin mind, and when they find an opportunity, they'll come out with what'seasy enough to say, but what's not pleasant to hear, and how will we allfeel then?"
While her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop hertears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest Pao-y� shouldbe annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repressthem. But in a short while, the old matrons employed for all sorts ofduties, brought in some mixture of two drugs; and, as Pao-y� noticedthat she was just on the point of perspiring, he did not allow her toget up, but readily taking it up to her, she immediately swallowed it,with her head still on her pillow; whereupon he gave speedy directionsto the young servant-maids to lay her stove-couch in order.
"Whether you mean to have anything to eat or not," Hsi Jen advised, "youshould after all sit for a time with our old mistress and our lady, andhave a romp with the young ladies; after which you can come back again;while I, by quietly keeping lying down, will also feel the better."
When Pao-y� heard this suggestion, he had no help but to accede, and,after she had divested herself of her hair-pins and earrings, and he sawher lie down, he betook himself into the drawing-rooms, where he had hisrepast with old lady Chia. But the meal over, her ladyship felt stilldisposed to play at cards with the nurses, who had looked after thehousehold for many years; and Pao-y�, bethinking himself of Hsi Jen,hastened to return to his apartments; where seeing that Hsi Jen wasdrowsily falling asleep, he himself would have wished to go to bed, butthe hour was yet early. And as about this time Ch'ing Wen, I Hsia, Ch'inWen, Pi Hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, startedin search of Y�an Yang, Hu Po and their companions, to have a romp withthem, and he espied She Y�eh alone in the outer room, having a game ofdominoes by lamp-light, Pao-y� inquired full of smiles: "How is it youdon't go with them?"
"I've no money," She Y�eh replied.
"Under the bed," continued Pao-y�, "is heaped up all that money, andisn't it enough yet for you to lose from?"
"Had we all gone to play," She Y�eh added, "to whom would the charge ofthis apartment have been handed over? That other one is sick again, andthe whole room is above, one mass of lamps, and below, full of fire; andall those old matrons, ancient as the heavens, should, after all theirexertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowedsome rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, havelikewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn't they even atthis hour be left to go and have some distraction? and that's why I amin here on watch."
When Pao-y� heard these words, which demonstrated distinctly that shewas another Hsi Jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: "I'llsit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!"
"Since you remain in here, there's less need for me to go," resumed SheY�eh, "for we two can chat and play and laugh; and won't that be nice?"
"What can we two do? it will be awfully dull! but never mind," Pao-y�rejoined; "this morning you said that your head itched, and now that youhave nothing to do, I may as well comb it for you."
"Yes! do so!" readily assented She Y�eh, upon catching what hesuggested; and while still speaking, she brought over the dressing-casecontaining a set of small drawers and looking-glass, and taking off herornaments, she dishevelled her hair; whereupon Pao-y� picked up the finecomb and passed it repeatedly through her hair; but he had only combedit three or five times, when he perceived Ch'ing Wen hurriedly walk into fetch some money. As soon as she caught sight of them both: "Youhaven't as yet drunk from the marriage cup," she said with a smile fullof irony, "and have you already put up your hair?"
"Now that you've come, let me also comb yours for you," Pao-y�continued.
"I'm not blessed with such excessive good fortune!" Ch'ing Wen retorted,and as she uttered these words, she took the money, and forthwithdashing the portiere after her, she quitted the room.
Pao-y� stood at the back of She Y�eh, and She Y�eh sat opposite theglass, so that the two of them faced each other in it, and Pao-y�readily observed as he gazed in the glass, "In the whole number of roomsshe's the only one who has a glib tongue!"
She Y�eh at these words hastily waved her hand towards the inside of theglass, and Pao-y� understood the hint; and suddenly a sound of "hu" washeard from the portiere, and Ch'ing Wen ran in once again.
"How have I got a glib tongue?" she inquired; "it would be well for usto explain ourselves."
"Go after your business, and have done," She Y�eh interposed laughingly;"what's the use of your coming and asking questions of people?"
"Will you also screen him?" Ch'ing Wen smiled significantly; "I know allabout your secret doings, but wait until I've got back my capital, andwe'll then talk matters over!"
With this remark still on her lips, she straightway quitted the room,and during this while, Pao-y� having finished combing her hair, askedShe Y�eh to quietly wait upon him, while he went to sleep, as he wouldnot like to disturb Hsi Jen.
Of the whole night there is nothing to record. But the next day, when hegot up at early dawn, Hsi Jen had already perspired, during the night,so that she felt considerably lighter and better; but limiting her dietto a little rice soup, she remained quiet and nursed herself, and Pao-y�was so relieved in mind that he came, after his meal, over on this sideto his aunt Hs�eh's on a saunter. The season was the course of the firstmoon, and the school was shut up for the new year holidays; while in theinner chambers the girls had put by their needlework, and were allhaving a time of leisure, and hence it was that when Chia Huan too cameover in search of distraction, he discovered Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang Ling,Ying Erh, the three of them, in the act of recreating themselves byplaying at chess. Chia Huan, at the sight of them, also wished to joinin their games; and Pao-ch'ai, who had always looked upon him with, infact, the same eye as she did Pao-y�, and with no different sentiment ofany kind, pressed him to come up, upon hearing that he was on thisoccasion desirous to play; and, when he had seated himself together withthem, they began to gamble, staking each time a pile of ten cash. Thefirst time, he was the winner, and he felt supremely elated at heart,but as it happened that he subsequently lost in several consecutivegames he soon became a prey to considerable distress. But in due coursecame the game in which it was his turn to cast the dice, and, if inthrowing, he got seven spots, he stood to win, but he was likewise boundto be a winner were he to turn up six; and when Ying Erh had turned upthree spots and lost, he consequently took up the dice, and dashing themwith spite, one of them settled at five; and, as the other reeled wildlyabout, Ying Erh clapped her hands, and kept on shouting, "one spot;"while Chia Huan at once gazed with fixed eye and cried at random: "It'ssix, it's seven, it's eight!" But the dice, as it happened, turned up atone spot, and Chia Huan was so exasperated that putting out his hand, hespeedily made a snatch at the dice, and eventually was about to lay holdof the money, arguing that it was six spot. But Ying Erh expostulated,"It was distinctly an ace," she said. And as Pao-ch'ai noticed howdistressed Chia Huan was, she forthwith cast a glance at Ying Erh andobserved: "The older you get, the less manners you have! Is it likelythat gentlemen will cheat you? and don't you yet put down the money?"
Ying Erh felt her whole heart much aggrieved, but as she heard Pao-ch'aimake these remarks, she did not presume to utter a sound, and as she wasunder the necessity of laying down the cash, she muttered to herself:"This one calls himself a gentleman, and yet cheats us of these fewcash, for which I myself even have no eye! The other day when I playedwith Mr. Pao-y�, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distresshimself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by afew servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that's all!"
Pao-ch'ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, butthere and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon ChiaHuan exclaimed: "How can I compare with Pao-y�; you all fear him, andkeep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for notbeing the child of my lady." And as he uttered these words, he at oncegave way to tears.
"My dear cousin," Pao-ch'ai hastened to advise him, "leave off at oncelanguage of this kind, for people will laugh at you;" and then went onto scold Ying Erh, when Pao-y� just happened to come in. Perceiving himin this plight, "What is the matter?" he asked; but Chia Huan had notthe courage to say anything.
Pao-ch'ai was well aware of the custom, which prevailed in their family,that younger brothers lived in respect of the elder brothers, but shewas not however cognisant of the fact that Pao-y� would not that any oneshould entertain any fear of him. His idea being that elder as well asyounger brothers had, all alike, father and mother to admonish them, andthat there was no need for any of that officiousness, which, instead ofdoing good gave, on the contrary, rise to estrangement. "Besides," (hereasoned,) "I'm the offspring of the primary wife, while he's the son ofthe secondary wife, and, if by treating him as leniently as I have done,there are still those to talk about me, behind my back, how could Iexercise any control over him?" But besides these, there were otherstill more foolish notions, which he fostered in his mind; but whatfoolish notions they were can you, reader, guess? As a result of hisgrowing up, from his early youth, among a crowd of girls, of whom, inthe way of sister, there was Y�an Ch'un, of cousins, from his paternaluncle's side, there were Ying Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, and of relativesalso there were Shih Hsiang-y�n, Lin Tai-y�, Hs�eh Pao-ch'ai and therest, he, in due course, resolved in his mind that the divine andunsullied virtue of Heaven and earth was only implanted in womankind,and that men were no more than feculent dregs and foul dirt. And forthis reason it was that men were without discrimination, considered byhim as so many filthy objects, which might or might not exist; while therelationships of father, paternal uncles, and brothers, he did nothowever presume to disregard, as these were among the injunctionsbequeathed by the holy man, and he felt bound to listen to a few oftheir precepts. But to the above causes must be assigned the fact that,among his brothers, he did no more than accomplish the general purportof the principle of human affections; bearing in mind no thoughtwhatever that he himself was a human being of the male sex, and that itwas his duty to be an example to his younger brothers. And this is whyChia Huan and the others entertained no respect for him, though in theirveneration for dowager lady Chia, they yielded to him to a certaindegree.
Pao-ch'ai harboured fears lest, on this occasion, Pao-y� should call himto book, and put him out of face, and she there and then lost no time intaking Chia Huan's part with a view to screening him.
"In this felicitous first moon what are you blubbering for?" Pao-y�inquired, "if this place isn't nice, why then go somewhere else to play.But from reading books, day after day, you've studied so much thatyou've become quite a dunce. If this thing, for instance, isn't good,that must, of course, be good, so then discard this and take up that,but is it likely that by sticking to this thing and crying for a whilethat it will become good? You came originally with the idea of reapingsome fun, and you've instead provoked yourself to displeasure, and isn'tit better then that you should be off at once."
Chia Huan upon hearing these words could not but come back to hisquarters; and Mrs. Chao noticing the frame of mind in which he was feltconstrained to inquire: "Where is it that you've been looked down uponby being made to fill up a hole, and being trodden under foot?"
"I was playing with cousin Pao-ch'ai," Chia Huan readily replied, "whenYing Erh insulted me, and deprived me of my money, and brother Pao-y�drove me away."
"Ts'ui!" exclaimed Mrs. Chao, "who bade you (presume so high) as to getup into that lofty tray? You low and barefaced thing! What place isthere that you can't go to and play; and who told you to run over thereand bring upon yourself all this shame?"
As she spoke, lady Feng was, by a strange coincidence, passing outsideunder the window; so that every word reached her ear, and she speedilyasked from outside the window: "What are you up to in this happy firstmoon? These brothers are, really, but mere children, and will you justfor a slight mistake, go on preaching to him! what's the use of comingout with all you've said? Let him go wherever he pleases; for there arestill our lady and Mr. Chia Cheng to keep him in order. But you go andsputter him with your gigantic mouth; he's at present a master, and ifthere be anything wrong about him, there are, after all, those to ratehim; and what business is that of yours? Brother Huan, come out withyou, and follow me and let us go and enjoy ourselves."
Chia Huan had ever been in greater fear and trembling of lady Feng, thanof madame Wang, so that when her summons reached his ear, he hurriedlywent out, while Mrs. Chao, on the other hand, did not venture to breathea single word.
"You too," resumed lady Feng, addressing Chia Huan; "are a thing devoidof all natural spirit! I've often told you that if you want to eat,drink, play, or laugh, you were quite free to go and play with whateverfemale cousin, male cousin, or sister-in-law you choose to disportyourself with; but you won't listen to my words. On the contrary, youlet all these persons teach you to be depraved in your heart, perversein your mind, to be sly, artful, and domineering; and you've, besides,no respect for your own self, but will go with that low-bred lot! andyour perverse purpose is to begrudge people's preferences! But whatyou've lost are simply a few cash, and do you behave in this manner? Howmuch did you lose?" she proceeded to ask Chia Huan; and Chia Huan, uponhearing this question, felt constrained to obey, by saying something inthe way of a reply. "I've lost," he explained, "some hundred or twohundred cash."
"You have," rejoined lady Feng, "the good fortune of being a gentleman,and do you make such a fuss for the loss of a hundred or two hundredcash!" and turning her head round, "Feng Erh," she added, "go and fetcha thousand cash; and as the girls are all playing at the back, take himalong to go and play. And if again by and by, you're so mean anddeceitful, I shall, first of all, beat you, and then tell some one toreport it at school, and won't your skin be flayed for you? All becauseof this want of respect of yours, your elder cousin is so angry with youthat his teeth itch; and were it not that I prevent him, he would hityou with his foot in the stomach and kick all your intestines out! Getaway," she then cried; whereupon Chia Huan obediently followed Feng Erh,and taking the money he went all by himself to play with Ying Ch'un andthe rest; where we shall leave him without another word.
But to return to Pao-y�. He was just amusing himself and laughing withPao-ch'ai, when at an unexpected moment, he heard some one announce thatMiss Shih had come. At these words, Pao-y� rose, and was at once goingoff when "Wait," shouted Pao-ch'ai with a smile, "and we'll go overtogether and see her."
Saying this, she descended from the stove-couch, and came, in companywith Pao-y�, to dowager lady Chia's on this side, where they saw ShihHsiang-y�n laughing aloud, and talking immoderately; and upon catchingsight of them both, she promptly inquired after their healths, andexchanged salutations.
Lin Tai-y� just happened to be standing by, and having set the questionto Pao-y� "Where do you come from?" "I come from cousin Pao-ch'ai'srooms," Pao-y� readily replied.
Tai-y� gave a sardonic smile. "What I maintain is this," she rejoined,"that lucky enough for you, you were detained over there; otherwise, youwould long ago have, at once, come flying in here!"
"Am I only free to play with you?" Pao-y� inquired, "and to dispel yourennui! I simply went over to her place for a run, and that quitecasually, and will you insinuate all these things?"
"Your words are quite devoid of sense," Tai-y� added; "whether you go ornot what's that to me? neither did I tell you to give me anydistraction; you're quite at liberty from this time forth not to pay anynotice to me!"
Saying this, she flew into a high dudgeon and rushed back into her room;but Pao-y� promptly followed in her footsteps: "Here you are again in ahuff," he urged, "and all for no reason! Had I even passed any remarkthat I shouldn't, you should anyhow have still sat in there, and chattedand laughed with the others for a while; instead of that, you come againto sit and mope all alone!"
"Are you my keeper?" Tai-y� expostulated.
"I couldn't, of course," Pao-y� smiled, "presume to exercise anyinfluence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your ownhealth harm!"
"If I do ruin my health," Tai-y� rejoined, "and I die, it's my ownlookout! what's that to do with you?"
"What's the good," protested Pao-y�, "of talking in this happy firstmoon of dying and of living?"
"I _will_ say die," insisted Tai-y�, "die now, at this very moment!but you're afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundredyears, but what good will that be!"
"If all we do is to go on nagging in this way," Pao-y� remarked smiling,"will I any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be betterto die, and be free!"
"Quite so!" continued Tai-y� with alacrity, "if we go on nagging in thisway, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free ofme!"
"I speak of my own self dying," Pao-y� added, "so don't misunderstand mywords and accuse people wrongly."
While he was as yet speaking, Pao-ch'ai entered the room: "Cousin Shihis waiting for you;" she said; and with these words, she hastily pushedPao-y� on, and they walked away.
Tai-y�, meanwhile, became more and more a prey to resentment; anddisconsolate as she felt, she shed tears in front of the window. But nottime enough had transpired to allow two cups of tea to be drunk, beforePao-y� came back again. At the sight of him, Tai-y� sobbed still morefervently and incessantly, and Pao-y� realising the state she was in,and knowing well enough how arduous a task it would be to bring herround, began to join together a hundred, yea a thousand kinds of softphrases and tender words to console her. But at an unforeseen moment,and before he could himself open his mouth, he heard Tai-y� anticipatehim.
"What have you come back again for?" she asked. "Let me die or live, asI please, and have done! You've really got at present some one to playwith you, one who, compared with me, is able to read and able tocompose, able to write, to speak, as well as to joke, one too who forfear lest you should have ruffled your temper dragged you away: and whatdo you return here for now?"
Pao-y�, after listening to all she had to say, hastened to come up toher. "Is it likely," he observed in a low tone of voice, "that anintelligent person like you isn't so much as aware that near relativescan't be separated by a distant relative, and a remote friend set asidean old friend! I'm stupid, there's no gainsaying, but I do anyhowunderstand what these two sentiments imply. You and I are, in the firstplace, cousins on my father's sister's side; while sister Pao-ch'ai andI are two cousins on mother's sides, so that, according to the degreesof relationship, she's more distant than yourself. In the second place,you came here first, and we two have our meals at one table and sleep inone bed, having ever since our youth grown up together; while she hasonly recently come, and how could I ever distance you on her account?"
"Ts'ui!" Tai-y� exclaimed. "Will I forsooth ever make you distance her!who and what kind of person have I become to do such a thing? What (Isaid) was prompted by my own motives."
"I too," Pao-y� urged, "made those remarks prompted by my own heart'smotives, and do you mean to say that your heart can only read thefeelings of your own heart, and has no idea whatsoever of my own?"
Tai-y� at these words, lowered her head and said not a word. But after along interval, "You only know," she continued, "how to feel bitteragainst people for their action in censuring you: but you don't, afterall, know that you yourself provoke people to such a degree, that it'shard for them to put up with it! Take for instance the weather of to-dayas an example. It's distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is itthat you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelissewith the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?"
"Why say I didn't wear it?" Pao-y� smilingly observed. "I did, butseeing you get angry I felt suddenly in such a terrible blaze, that I atonce took it off!"
Tai-y� heaved a sigh. "You'll by and by catch a cold," she remarked,"and then you'll again have to starve, and vociferate for something toeat!"
While these two were having this colloquy, Hsiang-y�n was seen to walkin! "You two, Ai cousin and cousin Lin," she ventured jokingly, "aretogether playing every day, and though I've managed to come after everso much trouble, you pay no heed to me at all!"
"It's invariably the rule," Tai-y� retorted smilingly, "that those whohave a defect in their speech will insist upon talking; she can't evencome out correctly with 'Erh' (secundus) cousin, and keeps on callinghim 'Ai' cousin, 'Ai' cousin! And by and by when you play 'Wei Ch'i'you're sure also to shout out yao, ai, (instead of erh), san; (one, two,three)."
Pao-y� laughed. "If you imitate her," he interposed, "and get into thathabit, you'll also begin to bite your tongue when you talk."
"She won't make even the slightest allowance for any one," Hsiang-y�nrejoined; "her sole idea being to pick out others' faults. You mayreadily be superior to any mortal being, but you shouldn't, after all,offend against what's right and make fun of every person you comeacross! But I'll point out some one, and if you venture to jeer her,I'll at once submit to you."
"Who is it?" Tai-y� vehemently inquired.
"If you do have the courage," Hsiang-y�n answered, "to pick out cousinPao-ch'ai's faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!"
Tai-y� after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile. "I waswondering," she observed, "who it was. Is it indeed she? How could Iever presume to pick out hers?"
Pao-y� allowed her no time to finish, but hastened to say something tointerrupt the conversation.
"I couldn't, of course, during the whole of this my lifetime,"Hsiang-y�n laughed, "attain your standard! but my earnest wish is thatby and by should be found for you, cousin Lin, a husband, who bites histongue when he speaks, so that you should every minute and second listento 'ai-ya-os!' O-mi-to-fu, won't then your reward be manifest to myeyes!"
As she made this remark, they all burst out laughing heartily, andHsiang-y�n speedily turned herself round and ran away.
But reader, do you want to know the sequel? Well, then listen to theexplanation given in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XXI.
  The eminent Hsi Jen, with winsome ways, rails at Pao-y�, with a view      to exhortation.  The beauteous P'ing Erh, with soft words, screens Chia Lien.
But to resume our story. When Shih Hsiang-y�n ran out of the room, shewas all in a flutter lest Lin Tai-y� should catch her up; but Pao-y�,who came after her, readily shouted out, "You'll trip and fall. How evercould she come up to you?"
Lin Tai-y� went in pursuit of her as far as the entrance, when she wasimpeded from making further progress by Pao-y�, who stretched his armsout against the posts of the door.
"Were I to spare Y�n Erh, I couldn't live!" Lin Tai-y� exclaimed, as shetugged at his arms. But Hsiang-y�n, perceiving that Pao-y� obstructedthe door, and surmising that Tai-y� could not come out, speedily stoodstill. "My dear cousin," she smilingly pleaded, "do let me off thistime!"
But it just happened that Pao-ch'ai, who was coming along, was at theback of Hsiang-y�n, and with a face also beaming with smiles: "I adviseyou both," she said, "to leave off out of respect for cousin Pao-y�, andhave done."
"I don't agree to that," Tai-y� rejoined; "are you people, pray, all ofone mind to do nothing but make fun of me?"
"Who ventures to make fun of you?" Pao-y� observed advisingly; "andhadn't you made sport of her, would she have presumed to have saidanything about you?"
While this quartet were finding it an arduous task to understand oneanother, a servant came to invite them to have their repast, and theyeventually crossed over to the front side, and as it was already timefor the lamps to be lit, madame Wang, widow Li Wan, lady Feng, YingCh'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and the other cousins, adjourned in a bodyto dowager lady Chia's apartments on this side, where the whole companyspent a while in a chat on irrelevant topics, after which they eachreturned to their rooms and retired to bed. Hsiang-y�n, as of old,betook herself to Tai-y�'s quarters to rest, and Pao-y� escorted themboth into their apartment, and it was after the hour had already pastthe second watch, and Hsi Jen had come and pressed him several times,that he at length returned to his own bedroom and went to sleep. Thenext morning, as soon as it was daylight, he threw his clothes over him,put on his low shoes and came over into Tai-y�'s room, where he howeversaw nothing of the two girls Tzu Ch�an and Ts'ui Lu, as there was no oneelse here in there besides his two cousins, still reclining under thecoverlets. Tai-y� was closely wrapped in a quilt of almond-red silk, andlying quietly, with closed eyes fast asleep; while Shih Hsiang-y�n, withher handful of shiny hair draggling along the edge of the pillow, wascovered only up to the chest, and outside the coverlet rested her curvedsnow-white arm, with the gold bracelets, which she had on.
At the sight of her, Pao-y� heaved a sigh. "Even when asleep," hesoliloquised, "she can't be quiet! but by and by, when the wind willhave blown on her, she'll again shout that her shoulder is sore!" Withthese words, he gently covered her, but Lin Tai-y� had already awoke outof her sleep, and becoming aware that there was some one about, shepromptly concluded that it must, for a certainty, be Pao-y�, and turningherself accordingly round, and discovering at a glance that the truthwas not beyond her conjectures, she observed: "What have you run over todo at this early hour?" to which question Pao-y� replied: "Do you callthis early? but get up and see for yourself!"
"First quit the room," Tai-y� suggested, "and let us get up!"
Pao-y� thereupon made his exit into the ante-chamber, and Tai-y� jumpedout of bed, and awoke Hsiang-y�n. When both of them had put on theirclothes, Pao-y� re-entered and took a seat by the side of the toilettable; whence he beheld Tzu-ch�an and Hs�eh Yen walk in and wait uponthem, as they dressed their hair and performed their ablutions.Hsiang-y�n had done washing her face, and Ts'�i L� at once took theremaining water and was about to throw it away, when Pao-y� interposed,saying: "Wait, I'll avail myself of this opportunity to wash too andfinish with it, and thus save myself the trouble of having again to goover!" Speaking the while, he hastily came forward, and bending hiswaist, he washed his face twice with two handfuls of water, and when TzuCh�an went over to give him the scented soap, Pao-y� added: "In thisbasin, there's a good deal of it, and there's no need of rubbing anymore!" He then washed his face with two more handfuls, and forthwithasked for a towel, and Ts'�i L� exclaimed: "What! have you still gotthis failing? when will you turn a new leaf?" But Pao-y� paid not somuch as any heed to her, and there and then called for some salt, withwhich he rubbed his teeth, and rinsed his mouth. When he had done, heperceived that Hsiang-y�n had already finished combing her hair, andspeedily coming up to her, he put on a smile, and said: "My dear cousin,comb my hair for me!"
"This can't be done!" Hsiang-y�n objected.
"My dear cousin," Pao-y� continued smirkingly, "how is it that youcombed it for me in former times?"
"I've forgotten now how to comb it!" Hsiang-y�n replied.
"I'm not, after all, going out of doors," Pao-y� observed, "nor will Iwear a hat or frontlet, so that all that need be done is to plait a fewqueues, that's all!" Saying this, he went on to appeal to her in athousand and one endearing terms, so that Hsiang-y�n had no alternative,but to draw his head nearer to her and to comb one queue after another,and as when he stayed at home he wore no hat, nor had, in fact, anytufted horns, she merely took the short surrounding hair from all foursides, and twisting it into small tufts, she collected it together overthe hair on the crown of the head, and plaited a large queue, binding itfast with red ribbon; while from the root of the hair to the end of thequeue, were four pearls in a row, below which, in the way of a tip, wassuspended a golden pendant.
"Of these pearls there are only three," Hsiang-y�n remarked as she wenton plaiting; "this isn't one like them; I remember these were all of onekind, and how is it that there's one short?"
"I've lost one," Pao-y� rejoined.
"It must have dropped," Hsiang-y�n added, "when you went out of doors,and been picked up by some one when you were off your guard; and he'snow, instead of you, the richer for it."
"One can neither tell whether it has been really lost," Tai-y�, whostood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; "nor could onesay whether it hasn't been given away to some one to be mounted in sometrinket or other and worn!"
Pao-y� made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of thedressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles,taking up those that came under his hand and examining them. Graspingunawares a box of cosmetic, which was within his reach, he would haveliked to have brought it to his lips, but he feared again lestHsiang-y�n should chide him. While he was hesitating whether to do so ornot, Hsiang-y�n, from behind, stretched forth her arm and gave him asmack, which sent the cosmetic flying from his hand, as she cried out:"You good-for-nothing! when will you mend those weaknesses of yours!"But hardly had she had time to complete this remark, when she caughtsight of Hsi Jen walk in, who upon perceiving this state of things,became aware that he was already combed and washed, and she feltconstrained to go back and attend to her own coiffure and ablutions. Butsuddenly, she saw Pao-ch'ai come in and inquire: "Where's cousin Pao-y�gone?"
"Do you mean to say," Hsi Jen insinuated with a sardonic smile, "thatyour cousin Pao-y� has leisure to stay at home?"
When Pao-ch'ai heard these words, she inwardly comprehended her meaning,and when she further heard Hsi Jen remark with a sigh: "Cousins may wellbe on intimate terms, but they should also observe some sort ofpropriety; and they shouldn't night and day romp together; and no matterhow people may tender advice it's all like so much wind blowing past theears." Pao-ch'ai began, at these remarks, to cogitate within her mind:"May I not, possibly, have been mistaken in my estimation of this girl;for to listen to her words, she would really seem to have a certainamount of _savoir faire_!"
Pao-ch'ai thereupon took a seat on the stove-couch, and quietly, in thecourse of their conversation on one thing and another, she managed toascertain her age, her native village and other such particulars, andthen setting her mind diligently to put, on the sly, her conversationand mental capacity to the test, she discovered how deeply worthy shewas to be respected and loved. But in a while Pao-y� arrived, andPao-ch'ai at once quitted the apartment.
"How is it," Pao-y� at once inquired, "that cousin Pao-ch'ai waschatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw meenter, she promptly ran away?"
Hsi Jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was onlywhen he had repeated it that Hsi Jen remarked: "Do you ask me? How can Iknow what goes on between you two?"
When Pao-y� heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her facewas so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smileand asking: "Why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?"
"How could I presume to get angry!" Hsi Jen rejoined smilingindifferently; "but you mustn't, from this day forth, put your foot intothis room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn'tcome again to make use of my services, for I mean to go and attend toour old mistress, as in days of old."
With this remark still on her lips, she lay herself down on thestove-couch and closed her eyes. When Pao-y� perceived the state of mindshe was in, he felt deeply surprised and could not refrain from comingforward and trying to cheer her up. But Hsi Jen kept her eyes closed andpaid no heed to him, so that Pao-y� was quite at a loss how to act. Butespying She Y�eh enter the room, he said with alacrity: "What's up withyour sister?"
"Do I know?" answered She Y�eh, "examine your own self and you'llreadily know!"
After these words had been heard by Pao-y�, he gazed vacantly for sometime, feeling the while very unhappy; but raising himself impetuously:"Well!" he exclaimed, "if you don't notice me, all right, I too will goto sleep," and as he spoke he got up, and, descending from the couch, hebetook himself to his own bed and went to sleep. Hsi Jen noticing thathe had not budged for ever so long, and that he faintly snored, presumedthat he must have fallen fast asleep, so she speedily rose to her feet,and, taking a wrapper, came over and covered him. But a sound of "hu"reached her ear, as Pao-y� promptly threw it off and once again closedhis eyes and feigned sleep. Hsi Jen distinctly grasped his idea and,forthwith nodding her head, she smiled coldly. "You really needn't loseyour temper! but from this time forth, I'll become mute, and not say oneword to you; and what if I do?"
Pao-y� could not restrain himself from rising. "What have I been up toagain," he asked, "that you're once more at me with your advice? As faras your advice goes, it's all well and good; but just now without oneword of counsel, you paid no heed to me when I came in, but, flying intoa huff, you went to sleep. Nor could I make out what it was all about,and now here you are again maintaining that I'm angry. But when did Ihear you, pray, give me a word of advice of any kind?"
"Doesn't your mind yet see for itself?" Hsi Jen replied; "and do youstill expect me to tell you?"
While they were disputing, dowager lady Chia sent a servant to call himto his repast, and he thereupon crossed over to the front; but after hehad hurriedly swallowed a few bowls of rice, he returned to his ownapartment, where he discovered Hsi Jen reclining on the outerstove-couch, while She Y�eh was playing with the dominoes by her side.Pao-y� had been ever aware of the intimacy which existed between SheY�eh and Hsi Jen, so that paying not the slightest notice to even SheY�eh, he raised the soft portiere and straightway walked all alone intothe inner apartment. She Y�eh felt constrained to follow him in, butPao-y� at once pushed her out, saying: "I don't venture to disturb youtwo;" so that She Y�eh had no alternative but to leave the room with asmiling countenance, and to bid two young waiting-maids go in. Pao-y�took hold of a book and read for a considerable time in a recliningposition; but upon raising his head to ask for some tea, he caught sightof a couple of waiting-maids, standing below; the one of whom, slightlyolder than the other, was exceedingly winsome.
"What's your name?" Pao-y� eagerly inquired.
"I'm called Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)," that waiting-maid rejoinedsimperingly.
"Who gave you this name?" Pao-y� went on to ask.
"I went originally under the name of Y�n Hsiang (Gum Sandarac)," addedHui Hsiang, "but Miss Hua it was who changed it."
"You should really be called Hui Ch'i, (latent fragrance), that would beproper; and why such stuff as Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)?"
"How many sisters have you got?" he further went on to ask of her.
"Four," replied Hui Hsiang.
"Which of them are you?" Pao-y� asked.
"The fourth," answered Hui Hsiang.
"By and by you must be called Ssu Erh, (fourth child)," Pao-y�suggested, "for there's no need for any such nonsense as Hui Hsiang(orchid fragrance) or Lan Ch'i (epidendrum perfume.) Which single girldeserves to be compared to all these flowers, without profaning prettynames and fine surnames!"
As he uttered these words, he bade her give him some tea, which hedrank; while Hsi Jen and She Y�eh, who were in the outer apartment, hadbeen listening for a long time and laughing with compressed lips.
Pao-y� did not, on this day, so much as put his foot outside the door ofhis room, but sat all alone sad and dejected, simply taking up hisbooks, in order to dispel his melancholy fit, or diverting himself withhis writing materials; while he did not even avail himself of theservices of any of the family servants, but simply bade Ssu Erh answerhis calls.
This Ssu Erh was, who would have thought it, a girl gifted withmatchless artfulness, and perceiving that Pao-y� had requisitioned herservices, she speedily began to devise extreme ways and means toinveigle him. When evening came, and dinner was over, Pao-y�'s eyes werescorching hot and his ears burning from the effects of two cups of winethat he had taken. Had it been in past days, he would have now had HsiJen and her companions with him, and with all their good cheer andlaughter, he would have been enjoying himself. But here was he, on thisoccasion, dull and forlorn, a solitary being, gazing at the lamp with anabsolute lack of pleasure. By and by he felt a certain wish to go afterthem, but dreading that if they carried their point, they would, in thefuture, come and tender advice still more immoderate, and that, were heto put on the airs of a superior to intimidate them, he would appear tobe too deeply devoid of all feeling, he therefore, needless to say,thwarted the wish of his heart, and treated them just as if they weredead. And as anyway he was constrained also to live, alone though hewas, he readily looked upon them, for the time being as departed, anddid not worry his mind in the least on their account. On the contrary,he was able to feel happy and contented with his own society. Hence itwas that bidding Ssu Erh trim the candles and brew the tea, he himselfperused for a time the "Nan Hua Ching," and upon reaching the precept:"On thieves," given on some additional pages, the burden of which was:"Therefore by exterminating intuitive wisdom, and by discardingknowledge, highway robbers will cease to exist, and by taking off thejade and by putting away the pearls, pilferers will not spring toexistence; by burning the slips and by breaking up the seals, bysmashing the measures, and snapping the scales, the result will be thatthe people will not wrangle; by abrogating, to the utmost degree, wiserules under the heavens, the people will, at length, be able to takepart in deliberation. By putting to confusion the musical scale, anddestroying fifes and lutes, by deafening the ears of the blind Kuang,then, at last, will the human race in the world constrain his sense ofhearing. By extinguishing literary compositions, by dispersing the fivecolours and by sticking the eyes of Li Chu, then, at length, mankindunder the whole sky, will restrain the perception of his eyes. Bydestroying and eliminating the hooks and lines, by discarding thecompasses and squares, and by amputating Kung Chui's fingers, the humanrace will ultimately succeed in constraining his ingenuity,"--his highspirits, on perusal of this passage, were so exultant that takingadvantage of the exuberance caused by the wine, he picked up his pen,for he could not repress himself, and continued the text in this wise:"By burning the flower, (Hua-Hsi Jen) and dispersing the musk, (SheY�eh), the consequence will be that the inmates of the inner chamberswill, eventually, keep advice to themselves. By obliterating Pao-ch'ai'ssupernatural beauty, by reducing to ashes Tai-y�'s spiritual perception,and by destroying and extinguishing my affectionate preferences, thebeautiful in the inner chambers as well as the plain will then, atlength, be put on the same footing. And as they will keep advice tothemselves, there will be no fear of any disagreement. By obliteratingher supernatural beauty, I shall then have no incentive for any violentaffection; by dissolving her spiritual perception, I will have nofeelings with which to foster the memory of her talents. The hair-pin,jade, flower and musk (Pao-ch'ai, Tai-y�, Hsi Jen and She Y�eh) do eachand all spread out their snares and dig mines, and thus succeed ininveigling and entrapping every one in the world."
At the conclusion of this annex, he flung the pen away, and lay himselfdown to sleep. His head had barely reached the pillow before he at oncefell fast asleep, remaining the whole night long perfectly unconsciousof everything straight up to the break of day, when upon waking andturning himself round, he, at a glance, caught sight of no one else thanHsi Jen, sleeping in her clothes over the coverlet.
Pao-y� had already banished from his mind every thought of what hadtranspired the previous day, so that forthwith giving Hsi Jen a push:"Get up!" he said, "and be careful where you sleep, as you may catchcold."
The fact is that Hsi Jen was aware that he was, without regard to day ornight, ever up to mischief with his female cousins; but presuming thatif she earnestly called him to account, he would not mend his ways, shehad, for this reason, had recourse to tender language to exhort him, inthe hope that, in a short while, he would come round again to his betterself. But against all her expectations Pao-y� had, after the lapse of awhole day and night, not changed the least in his manner, and as shereally was in her heart quite at a loss what to do, she failed to findthroughout the whole night any proper sleep. But when on this day, sheunexpectedly perceived Pao-y� in this mood, she flattered herself thathe had made up his mind to effect a change, and readily thought it bestnot to notice him. Pao-y�, seeing that she made no reply, forthwithstretched out his hand and undid her jacket; but he had just unclaspedthe button, when his arm was pushed away by Hsi Jen, who again made itfast herself.
Pao-y� was so much at his wit's ends that he had no alternative but totake her hand and smilingly ask: "What's the matter with you, after all,that I've had to ask you something time after time?"
Hsi Jen opened her eyes wide. "There's nothing really the matter withme!" she observed; "but as you're awake, you surely had better be goingover into the opposite room to comb your hair and wash; for if youdilly-dally any longer, you won't be in time."
"Where shall I go over to?" Pao-y� inquired.
Hsi Jen gave a sarcastic grin. "Do you ask me?" she rejoined; "do Iknow? you're at perfect liberty to go over wherever you like; from thisday forth you and I must part company so as to avoid fighting like cocksor brawling like geese, to the amusement of third parties. Indeed, whenyou get surfeited on that side, you come over to this, where there are,after all, such girls as Fours and Fives (Ssu Erh and Wu Erh) to danceattendance upon you. But such kind of things as ourselves uselesslydefile fine names and fine surnames."
"Do you still remember this to-day!" Pao-y� asked with a smirk.
"Hundred years hence I shall still bear it in mind," Hsi Jen protested;"I'm not like you, who treat my words as so much wind blowing by theside of your ears, that what I've said at night, you've forgotten earlyin the morning."
Pao-y� perceiving what a seductive though angry air pervaded her facefound it difficult to repress his feelings, and speedily taking up, fromthe side of the pillow, a hair-pin made of jade, he dashed it downbreaking it into two exclaiming: "If I again don't listen to your words,may I fare like this hair-pin."
Hsi Jen immediately picked up the hair-pin, as she remarked: "What's upwith you at this early hour of the morning? Whether you listen or not isof no consequence; and is it worth while that you should behave as youdo?"
"How can you know," Pao-y� answered, "the anguish in my heart!"
"Do you also know what anguish means?" Hsi Jen observed laughing; "ifyou do, then you can judge what the state of my heart is! But be quickand get up, and wash your face and be off!"
As she spoke, they both got out of bed and performed their toilette; butafter Pao-y� had gone to the drawing rooms, and at a moment leastexpected by any one, Tai-y� walked into his apartment. Noticing thatPao-y� was not in, she was fumbling with the books on the table andexamining them, when, as luck would have it, she turned up the ChuangTzu of the previous day. Upon perusing the passage tagged on by Pao-y�,she could not help feeling both incensed and amused. Nor could sherestrain herself from taking up the pen and appending a stanza to thiseffect:
  Who is that man, who of his pen, without good rhyme, made use,  A toilsome task to do into the Chuang-tzu text to steal,  Who for the knowledge he doth lack no sense of shame doth feel,  But language vile and foul employs third parties to abuse?
At the conclusion of what she had to write, she too came into thedrawing room; but after paying her respects to dowager lady Chia, shewalked over to madame Wang's quarters.
Contrary to everybody's expectations, lady Feng's daughter, Ta ChiehErh, had fallen ill, and a great fuss was just going on as the doctorhad been sent for to diagnose her ailment.
"My congratulations to you, ladies," the doctor explained; "this younglady has fever, as she has small-pox; indeed it's no other complaint!"
As soon as madame Wang and lady Feng heard the tidings, they lost notime in sending round to ascertain whether she was getting on all rightor not, and the doctor replied: "The symptoms are, it is true, serious,but favourable; but though after all importing no danger, it's necessaryto get ready the silkworms and pigs' tails."
When lady Feng received this report, she, there and then, hastened tomake the necessary preparations, and while she had the rooms swept andoblations offered to the goddess of small-pox, she, at the same time,transmitted orders to her household to avoid viands fried or roasted infat, or other such heating things; and also bade P'ing Erh get ready thebedding and clothes for Chia Lien in a separate room, and taking piecesof deep red cotton material, she distributed them to the nurses,waiting-maids and all the servants, who were in close attendance, to cutout clothes for themselves. And having had likewise some apartmentsoutside swept clean, she detained two doctors to alternately deliberateon the treatment, feel the pulse and administer the medicines; and fortwelve days, they were not at liberty to return to their homes; whileChia Lien had no help but to move his quarters temporarily into theouter library, and lady Feng and P'ing Erh remained both in dailyattendance upon madame Wang in her devotions to the goddess.
Chia Lien, now that he was separated from lady Feng, soon felt disposedto look round for a flame. He had only slept alone for a couple ofnights, but these nights had been so intensely intolerable that he hadno option than to choose, for the time being, from among the youngpages, those who were of handsome appearance, and bring them over torelieve his monotony. In the Jung Kuo mansion, there was, it happened, acook, a most useless, good-for-nothing drunkard, whose name was To Kuan,in whom people recognised an infirm and a useless husband so that theyall dubbed him with the name of To Hun Ch'ung, the stupid worm To. Asthe wife given to him in marriage by his father and mother was this yearjust twenty, and possessed further several traits of beauty, and wasalso naturally of a flighty and frivolous disposition, she had anextreme penchant for violent flirtations. But To Hun-ch'ung, on theother hand, did not concern himself (with her deportment), and as longas he had wine, meat and money he paid no heed whatever to anything. Andfor this reason it was that all the men in the two mansions of Ning andJung had been successful in their attentions; and as this woman wasexceptionally fascinating and incomparably giddy, she was generallyknown by all by the name To Ku Ning (Miss To).
Chia Lien, now that he had his quarters outside, chafed under the pangsof irksome ennui, yet he too, in days gone by, had set his eyes uponthis woman, and had for long, watered in the mouth with admiration; butas, inside, he feared his winsome wife, and outside, he dreaded hisbeloved lads, he had not made any advances. But this To Ku Niang hadlikewise a liking for Chia Lien, and was full of resentment at theabsence of a favourable opportunity; but she had recently come to hearthat Chia Lien had shifted his quarters into the outer library, and herwont was, even in the absence of any legitimate purpose, to go overthree and four times to entice him on; but though Chia Lien was, inevery respect, like a rat smitten with hunger, he could not dispensewith holding consultation with the young friends who enjoyed hisconfidence; and as he struck a bargain with them for a large amount ofmoney and silks, how could they ever not have come to terms (with him tospeak on his behalf)? Besides, they were all old friends of this woman,so that, as soon as they conveyed the proposal, she willingly acceptedit. When night came To Hun Ch'ung was lying on the couch in a state ofdrunkenness, and at the second watch, when every one was quiet, ChiaLien at once slipped in, and they had their assignation. As soon as hegazed upon her face, he lost control over his senses, and without evenone word of ordinary greeting or commonplace remark, they forthwith,fervently indulged in a most endearing t�te-�-t�te.
This woman possessed, who could have thought it, a strange naturalcharm; for, as soon as any one of her lovers came within any closedistance of her, he speedily could not but notice that her very tendonsand bones mollified, paralysed-like from feeling, so that his was thesensation of basking in a soft bower of love. What is more, herdemonstrative ways and free-and-easy talk put even those of a borncoquette to shame, with the result that while Chia Lien, at this time,longed to become heart and soul one with her, the woman designedlyindulged in immodest innuendoes.
"Your daughter is at home," she insinuated in her recumbent position,"ill with the small-pox, and prayers are being offered to the goddess;and your duty too should be to abstain from love affairs for a couple ofdays, but on the contrary, by flirting with me, you've contaminatedyourself! but, you'd better be off at once from me here!"
"You're my goddess!" gaspingly protested Chia Lien, as he gave way todemonstrativeness; "what do I care about any other goddess!"
The woman began to be still more indelicate in her manner, so that ChiaLien could not refrain himself from making a full exhibition of his warmsentiments. When their t�te-�-t�te had come to a close, they both wenton again to vow by the mountains and swear by the seas, and though theyfound it difficult to part company and hard to tear themselves away,they, in due course, became, after this occasion, mutual sworn friends.But by a certain day the virus in Ta Chieh's system had becomeexhausted, and the spots subsided, and at the expiry of twelve days thegoddess was removed, and the whole household offered sacrifices toheaven, worshipped the ancestors, paid their vows, burnt incense,exchanged congratulations, and distributed presents. And theseformalities observed, Chia Lien once more moved back into his ownbedroom and was reunited with lady Feng. The proverb is indeed truewhich says: "That a new marriage is not equal to a long separation," forthere ensued between them demonstrations of loving affection still morenumerous than heretofore, to which we need not, of course, refer withany minuteness.
The next day, at an early hour, after lady Feng had gone into the upperrooms, P'ing Erh set to work to put in order the clothes and bedding,which had been brought from outside, when, contrary to her expectation,a tress of hair fell out from inside the pillow-case, as she was intentupon shaking it. P'ing Erh understood its import, and taking at once thehair, she concealed it in her sleeve, and there and then came over intothe room on this side, where she produced the hair, and smirkingly askedChia Lien, "What's this?"
Chia Lien, at the sight of it, lost no time in making a snatch with theidea of depriving her of it; and when P'ing Erh speedily endeavoured torun away, she was clutched by Chia Lien, who put her down on thestove-couch, and came up to take it from her hand.
"You heartless fellow!" P'ing Erh laughingly exclaimed, "I conceal this,with every good purpose, from her knowledge, and come to ask you aboutit, and you, on the contrary, fly into a rage! But wait till she comesback, and I'll tell her, and we'll see what will happen."
At these words, Chia Lien hastily forced a smile. "Dear girl!" heentreated, "give it to me, and I won't venture again to fly into apassion."
But hardly was this remark finished, when they heard the voice of ladyFeng penetrate into the room. As soon as it reached the ear of ChiaLien, he was at a loss whether it was better to let her go or to snatchit away, and kept on shouting, "My dear girl! don't let her know."
P'ing Erh at once rose to her feet; but lady Feng had already enteredthe room; and she went on to bid P'ing Erh be quick and open a box andfind a pattern for madame Wang. P'ing Erh expressed her obedience withalacrity; but while in search of it, lady Feng caught sight of ChiaLien; and suddenly remembering something, she hastened to ask P'ing Erhabout it.
"The other day," she observed, "some things were taken out, and have youbrought them all in or not?"
"I have!" P'ing Erh assented.
"Is there anything short or not?" lady Feng inquired.
"I've carefully looked at them," P'ing Erh added, "and haven't foundeven one single thing short."
"Is there anything in excess?" lady Feng went on to ascertain.
P'ing Erh laughed. "It's enough," she rejoined, "that there's nothingshort; and how could there really turn out to be anything over andabove?"
"That this half month," lady Feng continued still smiling, "things havegone on immaculately it would be hard to vouch; for some intimate friendthere may have been, who possibly has left something behind, in theshape of a ring, handkerchief or other such object, there's no sayingfor certain!"
While these words were being spoken, Chia Lien's face turned perfectlysallow, and, as he stood behind lady Feng, he was intent upon gazing atP'ing Erh, making signs to her (that he was going) to cut her throat asa chicken is killed, (threatening her not to utter a sound) andentreating her to screen him; but P'ing Erh pretended not to notice him,and consequently observed smiling: "How is it that my ideas shouldcoincide with those of yours, my lady; and as I suspected that there mayhave been something of the kind, I carefully searched all over, but Ididn't find even so much as the slightest thing wrong; and if you don'tbelieve me, my lady, you can search for your own self."
"You fool!" lady Feng laughed, "had he any things of the sort, would hebe likely to let you and I discover them!"
With these words still on her lips, she took the patterns and went herway; whereupon P'ing Erh pointed at her nose, and shook her head to andfro. "In this matter," she smiled, "how much you should be grateful tome!" A remark which so delighted Chia Lien that his eyebrows distended,and his eyes smiled, and running over, he clasped her in his embrace,and called her promiscuously: "My darling, my pet, my own treasure!"
"This," observed P'ing Erh, with the tress in her hand, "will be mysource of power, during all my lifetime! if you treat me kindly, thenwell and good! but if you behave unkindly, then we'll at once producethis thing!"
"Do put it away, please," Chia Lien entreated smirkingly, "and don't, onan any account, let her know about it!" and as he uttered these words,he noticed that she was off her guard, and, with a snatch, readilygrabbed it adding laughingly: "In your hands, it would be a source ofwoe, so that it's better that I should burn it, and have done with it!"Saying this he simultaneously shoved it down the sides of his boot,while P'ing Erh shouted as she set her teeth close: "You wicked man! youcross the river and then demolish the bridge! but do you imagine thatI'll by and by again tell lies on your behalf!"
Chia Lien perceiving how heart-stirring her seductive charms were,forthwith clasped her in his arms, and begged her to be his; but P'ingErh snatched her hands out of his grasp and ran away out of the room;which so exasperated Chia Lien that as he bent his body, he exclaimed,full of indignation: "What a dreadful niggardly young wench! sheactually sets her mind to stir up people's affections with her wantonblandishments, and then, after all, she runs away!"
"If I be wanton, it's my own look-out;" P'ing Erh answered, from outsidethe window, with a grin, "and who told you to arouse your affections? Doyou forsooth mean to imply that my wish is to become your tool? And didshe come to know about it would she again ever forgive me?"
"You needn't dread her!" Chia Lien urged; "wait till my monkey is up,and I'll take this jealous woman, and beat her to atoms; and she'll thenknow what stuff I'm made of. She watches me just as she would watch athief! and she's only to hobnob with men, and I'm not to say a word toany girl! and if I do say aught to a girl, or get anywhere near one, shemust at once give way to suspicion. But with no regard to youngerbrothers or nephews, to young and old, she prattles and giggles withthem, and doesn't entertain any fear that I may be jealous; buthenceforward I too won't allow her to set eyes upon any man."
"If she be jealous, there's every reason," P'ing Erh answered, "but foryou to be jealous on her account isn't right. Her conduct is reallystraightforward, and her deportment upright, but your conduct isactuated by an evil heart, so much so that even I don't feel my heart atease, not to say anything of her."
"You two," continued Chia Lien, "have a mouth full of malicious breath!Everything the couple of you do is invariably proper, while whatever Ido is all from an evil heart! But some time or other I shall bring youboth to your end with my own hands!"
This sentence was scarcely at an end, when lady Feng walked into thecourt. "If you're bent upon chatting," she urgently inquired, uponseeing P'ing Erh outside the window, "why don't you go into the room?and what do you mean, instead, by running out, and speaking with thewindow between?"
Chia Lien from inside took up the string of the conversation. "Youshould ask her," he said. "It would verily seem as if there were a tigerin the room to eat her up."
"There's not a single person in the room," P'ing Erh rejoined, "and whatshall I stay and do with him?"
"It's just the proper thing that there should be no one else! Isn't it?"lady Feng remarked grinning sarcastically.
"Do these words allude to me?" P'ing Erh hastily asked, as soon as shehad heard what she said.
Lady Feng forthwith laughed. "If they don't allude to you," shecontinued, "to whom do they?"
"Don't press me to come out with some nice things!" P'ing Erhinsinuated, and, as she spoke, she did not even raise the portiere (forlady Feng to enter), but straightway betook herself to the oppositeside.
Lady Feng lifted the portiere with her own hands, and walked into theroom. "That girl P'ing Erh," she exclaimed, "has gone mad, and if thishussey does in real earnest wish to try and get the upper hand of me, itwould be well for you to mind your skin."
Chia Lien listened to her, as he kept reclining on the couch. "I neverin the least knew," he ventured, clapping his hands and laughing, "thatP'ing Erh was so dreadful; and I must, after all, from henceforth lookup to her with respect!"
"It's all through your humouring her," lady Feng rejoined; "so I'llsimply settle scores with you and finish with it."
"Ts'ui!" ejaculated Chia Lien at these words, "because you two can'tagree, must you again make a scapegoat of me! Well then, I'll get out ofthe way of both of you!"
"I'll see where you'll go and hide," lady Feng observed.
"I've got somewhere to go!" Chia Lien added; and with these words, hewas about to go, when lady Feng urged: "Don't be off! I have somethingto tell you."
What it is, is not yet known, but, reader, listen to the account givenin the next chapter.

CHAPTER XXII.
  Upon hearing the text of the stanza, Pao-y� comprehends the Buddhistic      spells.  While the enigmas for the lanterns are being devised, Chia Cheng is      grieved by a prognostic.
Chia Lien, for we must now prosecute our story, upon hearing lady Fengobserve that she had something to consult about with him, feltconstrained to halt and to inquire what it was about.
"On the 21st," lady Feng explained, "is cousin Hs�eh's birthday, andwhat do you, after all, purpose doing?"
"Do I know what to do?" exclaimed Chia Lien; "you have made, time andagain, arrangements for ever so many birthdays of grown-up people, anddo you, really, find yourself on this occasion without any resources?"
"Birthdays of grown-up people are subject to prescribed rules," ladyFeng expostulated; "but her present birthday is neither one of an adultnor that of an infant, and that's why I would like to deliberate withyou!"
Chia Lien upon hearing this remark, lowered his head and gave himself toprotracted reflection. "You're indeed grown dull!" he cried; "why you'vea precedent ready at hand to suit your case! Cousin Lin's birthdayaffords a precedent, and what you did in former years for cousin Lin,you can in this instance likewise do for cousin Hs�eh, and it will beall right."
At these words lady Feng gave a sarcastic smile. "Do you, pray, mean toinsinuate," she added, "that I'm not aware of even this! I too hadpreviously come, after some thought, to this conclusion; but old ladyChia explained, in my hearing yesterday, that having made inquiriesabout all their ages and their birthdays, she learnt that cousin Hs�ehwould this year be fifteen, and that though this was not the birthday,which made her of age, she could anyhow well be regarded as being on thedawn of the year, in which she would gather up her hair, so that ourdowager lady enjoined that her anniversary should, as a matter ofcourse, be celebrated, unlike that of cousin Lin."
"Well, in that case," Chia Lien suggested, "you had better make a fewadditions to what was done for cousin Lin!"
"That's what I too am thinking of," lady Feng replied, "and that's whyI'm asking your views; for were I, on my own hook, to add anything youwould again feel hurt for my not have explained things to you."
"That will do, that will do!" Chia Lien rejoined laughing, "none ofthese sham attentions for me! So long as you don't pry into my doings itwill be enough; and will I go so far as to bear you a grudge?"
With these words still in his mouth, he forthwith went off. But leavinghim alone we shall now return to Shih Hsiang-y�n. After a stay of acouple of days, her intention was to go back, but dowager lady Chiasaid: "Wait until after you have seen the theatrical performance, whenyou can return home."
At this proposal, Shih Hsiang-y�n felt constrained to remain, but she,at the same time, despatched a servant to her home to fetch two piecesof needlework, which she had in former days worked with her own hands,for a birthday present for Pao-ch'ai.
Contrary to all expectations old lady Chia had, since the arrival ofPao-ch'ai, taken quite a fancy to her, for her sedateness and goodnature, and as this happened to be the first birthday which she wasabout to celebrate (in the family) she herself readily contributedtwenty taels which, after sending for lady Feng, she handed over to her,to make arrangements for a banquet and performance.
"A venerable senior like yourself," lady Feng thereupon smiled andventured, with a view to enhancing her good cheer, "is at liberty tocelebrate the birthday of a child in any way agreeable to you, withoutany one presuming to raise any objection; but what's the use again ofgiving a banquet? But since it be your good pleasure and your purpose tohave it celebrated with �clat, you could, needless to say, your own selfhave spent several taels from the private funds in that old treasury ofyours! But you now produce those twenty taels, spoiled by damp andmould, to play the hostess with, with the view indeed of compelling usto supply what's wanted! But hadn't you really been able to contributeany more, no one would have a word to say; but the gold and silver,round as well as flat, have with their heavy weight pressed down thebottom of the box! and your sole object is to harass us and to extortfrom us. But raise your eyes and look about you; who isn't yourvenerable ladyship's son and daughter? and is it likely, pray, that inthe future there will only be cousin Pao-y� to carry you, our old lady,on his head, up the Wu T'ai Shan? You may keep all these things for himalone! but though we mayn't at present, deserve that anything should bespent upon us, you shouldn't go so far as to place us in anyperplexities (by compelling us to subscribe). And is this now enough forwines, and enough for the theatricals?"
As she bandied these words, every one in the whole room burst outlaughing, and even dowager lady Chia broke out in laughter while sheobserved: "Do you listen to that mouth? I myself am looked upon ashaving the gift of the gab, but why is it that I can't talk in such awise as to put down this monkey? Your mother-in-law herself doesn't dareto be so overbearing in her speech; and here you are jabber, jabber withme!"
"My mother-in-law," explained lady Feng, "is also as fond of Pao-y� asyou are, so much so that I haven't anywhere I could go and give vent tomy grievances; and instead of (showing me some regard) you say that I'moverbearing in my speech!"
With these words, she again enticed dowager lady Chia to laugh for awhile. The old lady continued in the highest of spirits, and, whenevening came, and they all appeared in her presence to pay theirobeisance, her ladyship made it a point, while the whole company ofladies and young ladies were engaged in chatting, to ascertain ofPao-ch'ai what play she liked to hear, and what things she fancied toeat.
Pao-ch'ai was well aware that dowager lady Chia, well up in years thoughshe was, delighted in sensational performances, and was partial to sweetand tender viands, so that she readily deferred, in every respect, tothose things, which were to the taste of her ladyship, and enumerated awhole number of them, which made the old lady become the more exuberant.And the next day, she was the first to send over clothes, nicknacks andsuch presents, while madame Wang and lady Feng, Tai-y� and the othergirls, as well as the whole number of inmates had all presents for her,regulated by their degree of relationship, to which we need not alludein detail.
When the 21st arrived, a stage of an ordinary kind, small but yet handy,was improvised in dowager lady Chia's inner court, and a troupe of youngactors, who had newly made their d�but, was retained for the nonce,among whom were both those who could sing tunes, slow as well as fast.In the drawing rooms of the old lady were then laid out several tablesfor a family banquet and entertainment, at which there was not a singleoutside guest; and with the exception of Mrs. Hs�eh, Shih Hsiang-y�n,and Pao-ch'ai, who were visitors, the rest were all inmates of herhousehold.
On this day, Pao-y� failed, at any early hour, to see anything of LinTai-y�, and coming at once to her rooms in search of her, he discoveredher reclining on the stove-couch. "Get up," Pao-y� pressed her with asmile, "and come and have breakfast, for the plays will commenceshortly; but whichever plays you would like to listen to, do tell me sothat I may be able to choose them."
Tai-y� smiled sarcastically. "In that case," she rejoined, "you hadbetter specially engage a troupe and select those I like sung for mybenefit; for on this occasion you can't be so impertinent as to make useof their expense to ask me what I like!"
"What's there impossible about this?" Pao-y� answered smiling; "well,to-morrow I'll readily do as you wish, and ask them too to make use ofwhat is yours and mine."
As he passed this remark, he pulled her up, and taking her hand in hisown, they walked out of the room and came and had breakfast. When thetime arrived to make a selection of the plays, dowager lady Chia of herown motion first asked Pao-ch'ai to mark off those she liked; and thoughfor a time Pao-ch'ai declined, yielding the choice to others, she had noalternative but to decide, fixing upon a play called, "the Record of theWestern Tour," a play of which the old lady was herself very fond. Nextin order, she bade lady Feng choose, and lady Feng, had, after all, inspite of madame Wang ranking before her in precedence, to consider oldlady Chia's request, and not to presume to show obstinacy by anydisobedience. But as she knew well enough that her ladyship had apenchant for what was exciting, and that she was still more partial tojests, jokes, epigrams, and buffoonery, she therefore hastened toprecede (madame Wang) and to choose a play, which was in fact no otherthan "Liu Erh pawns his clothes."
Dowager lady Chia was, of course, still more elated. And after this shespeedily went on to ask Tai-y� to choose. Tai-y� likewise concedinglyyielded her turn in favour of madame Wang and the other seniors, to maketheir selections before her, but the old lady expostulated. "To-day,"she said, "is primarily an occasion, on which I've brought all of youhere for your special recreation; and we had better look after our ownselves and not heed them! For have I, do you imagine, gone to thetrouble of having a performance and laying a feast for their specialbenefit? they're already reaping benefit enough by being in here,listening to the plays and partaking of the banquet, when they have noright to either; and are they to be pressed further to make a choice ofplays?"
At these words, the whole company had a hearty laugh; after which,Tai-y�, at length, marked off a play; next in order following Pao-y�,Shih Hsiang-y�n, Ying-ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un, widow Li Wan, andthe rest, each and all of whom made a choice of plays, which were sungin the costumes necessary for each. When the time came to take theirplaces at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch'ai make anotherselection, and Pao-ch'ai cast her choice upon the play: "Lu Chih-shen,in a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T'ai mountain;"whereupon Pao-y� interposed, with the remark: "All you fancy is tochoose plays of this kind;" to which Pao-ch'ai rejoined, "You'velistened to plays all these years to no avail! How could you know thebeauties of this play? the stage effect is grand, but what is stillbetter are the apt and elegant passages in it."
"I've always had a dread of such sensational plays as these!" Pao-y�retorted.
"If you call this play sensational," Pao-ch'ai smilingly expostulated,"well then you may fitly be looked upon as being no connoisseur ofplays. But come over and I'll tell you. This play constitutes one of aset of books, entitled the 'Pei Tien Peng Ch'un,' which, as far asharmony, musical rests and closes, and tune go, is, it goes withoutsaying, perfect; but there's among the elegant compositions a balladentitled: 'the Parasitic Plant,' written in a most excellent style; buthow could you know anything about it?"
Pao-y�, upon hearing her speak of such points of beauty, hastily drewnear to her. "My dear cousin," he entreated, "recite it and let me hearit!" Whereupon Pao-ch'ai went on as follows:
  My manly tears I will not wipe away,  But from this place, the scholar's home, I'll stray.  The bonze for mercy I shall thank; under the lotus altar shave my      pate;  With Y�an to be the luck I lack; soon in a twinkle we shall separate,  And needy and forlorn I'll come and go, with none to care about my      fate.  Thither shall I a suppliant be for a fog wrapper and rain hat; my      warrant I shall roll,  And listless with straw shoes and broken bowl, wherever to convert my      fate may be, I'll stroll.
As soon as Pao-y� had listened to her recital, he was so full ofenthusiasm, that, clapping his knees with his hands, and shaking hishead, he gave vent to incessant praise; after which he went on to extolPao-ch'ai, saying: "There's no book that you don't know."
"Be quiet, and listen to the play," Lin Tai-y� urged; "they haven't yetsung about the mountain gate, and you already pretend to be mad!"
At these words, Hsiang-y�n also laughed. But, in due course, the wholeparty watched the performance until evening, when they broke up. Dowagerlady Chia was so very much taken with the young actor, who played therole of a lady, as well as with the one who acted the buffoon, that shegave orders that they should be brought in; and, as she looked at themclosely, she felt so much the more interest in them, that she went on toinquire what their ages were. And when the would-be lady (replied) thathe was just eleven, while the would-be buffoon (explained) that he wasjust nine, the whole company gave vent for a time to expressions ofsympathy with their lot; while dowager lady Chia bade servants bring afresh supply of meats and fruits for both of them, and also gave them,besides their wages, two tiaos as a present.
"This lad," lady Feng observed smiling, "is when dressed up (as a girl),a living likeness of a certain person; did you notice it just now?"
Pao-ch'ai was also aware of the fact, but she simply nodded her headassentingly and did not say who it was. Pao-y� likewise expressed hisassent by shaking his head, but he too did not presume to speak out.Shih Hsiang-y�n, however, readily took up the conversation. "Heresembles," she interposed, "cousin Lin's face!" When this remarkreached Pao-y�'s ear, he hastened to cast an angry scowl at Hsiang-y�n,and to make her a sign; while the whole party, upon hearing what hadbeen said, indulged in careful and minute scrutiny of (the lad); and asthey all began to laugh: "The resemblance is indeed striking!" theyexclaimed.
After a while, they parted; and when evening came Hsiang-y�n directedTs'ui L� to pack up her clothes.
"What's the hurry?" Ts'ui L� asked. "There will be ample time to packup, on the day on which we go!"
"We'll go to-morrow," Hsiang-y�n rejoined; "for what's the use ofremaining here any longer--to look at people's mouths and faces?"
Pao-y�, at these words, lost no time in pressing forward.
"My dear cousin," he urged; "you're wrong in bearing me a grudge! Mycousin Lin is a girl so very touchy, that though every one elsedistinctly knew (of the resemblance), they wouldn't speak out; and allbecause they were afraid that she would get angry; but unexpectedly outyou came with it, at a moment when off your guard; and how ever couldn'tshe but feel hurt? and it's because I was in dread that you would giveoffence to people that I then winked at you; and now here you are angrywith me; but isn't that being ungrateful to me? Had it been any oneelse, would I have cared whether she had given offence to even ten; thatwould have been none of my business!"
Hsiang-y�n waved her hand: "Don't," she added, "come and tell me theseflowery words and this specious talk, for I really can't come up to yourcousin Lin. If others poke fun at her, they all do so with impunity,while if I say anything, I at once incur blame. The fact is I shouldn'thave spoken of her, undeserving as I am; and as she's the daughter of amaster, while I'm a slave, a mere servant girl, I've heaped insult uponher!"
"And yet," pleaded Pao-y�, full of perplexity, "I had done it for yoursake; and through this, I've come in for reproach. But if it were withan evil heart I did so, may I at once become ashes, and be trampled uponby ten thousands of people!"
"In this felicitous firstmonth," Hsiang-y�n remonstrated, "you shouldn'ttalk so much reckless nonsense! All these worthless despicable oaths,disjointed words, and corrupt language, go and tell for the benefit ofthose mean sort of people, who in everything take pleasure in irritatingothers, and who keep you under their thumb! But mind don't drive me tospit contemptuously at you."
As she gave utterance to these words, she betook herself in the innerroom of dowager lady Chia's suite of apartments, where she lay down inhigh dudgeon, and, as Pao-y� was so heavy at heart, he could not helpcoming again in search of Tai-y�; but strange to say, as soon as he puthis foot inside the doorway, he was speedily hustled out of it byTai-y�, who shut the door in his face.
Pao-y� was once more unable to fathom her motives, and as he stoodoutside the window, he kept on calling out: "My dear cousin," in a lowtone of voice; but Tai-y� paid not the slightest notice to him so thatPao-y� became so melancholy that he drooped his head, and was plunged insilence. And though Hsi Jen had, at an early hour, come to know thecircumstances, she could not very well at this juncture tender anyadvice.
Pao-y� remained standing in such a vacant mood that Tai-y� imagined thathe had gone back; but when she came to open the door she caught sight ofPao-y� still waiting in there; and as Tai-y� did not feel justified toagain close the door, Pao-y� consequently followed her in.
"Every thing has," he observed, "a why and a wherefore; which, whenspoken out, don't even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage,and all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?"
"It's well enough, after all, for you to ask me," Tai-y� rejoined withan indifferent smile, "but I myself don't know why! But am I here toafford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, andmake the whole lot have a laugh at me?"
"I never did liken you to anything," Pao-y� protested, "neither did Iever laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?"
"Was it necessary that you should have done so much as made thecomparison," Tai-y� urged, "and was there any need of even any laughterfrom you? why, though you mayn't have likened me to anything, or had alaugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who didcompare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!"
Pao-y� could not find anything with which to refute the argument he hadjust heard, and Tai-y� went on to say. "This offence can, anyhow, becondoned; but, what is more, why did you also wink at Y�n Erh? What wasthis idea which you had resolved in your mind? wasn't it perhaps that ifshe played with me, she would be demeaning herself, and making herselfcheap? She's the daughter of a duke or a marquis, and we forsooth themean progeny of a poor plebeian family; so that, had she divertedherself with me, wouldn't she have exposed herself to being depreciated,had I, perchance, said anything in retaliation? This was your ideawasn't it? But though your purpose was, to be sure, honest enough, thatgirl wouldn't, however, receive any favours from you, but got angry withyou just as much as I did; and though she made me also a tool to do youa good turn, she, on the contrary, asserts that I'm mean by nature andtake pleasure in irritating people in everything! and you again wereafraid lest she should have hurt my feelings, but, had I had a row withher, what would that have been to you? and had she given me any offence,what concern would that too have been of yours?"
When Pao-y� heard these words, he at once became alive to the fact thatshe too had lent an ear to the private conversation he had had a shortwhile back with Hsiang-y�n: "All because of my, fears," he carefullymused within himself, "lest these two should have a misunderstanding, Iwas induced to come between them, and act as a mediator; but I myselfhave, contrary to my hopes, incurred blame and abuse on both sides! Thisjust accords with what I read the other day in the Nan Hua Ching. 'Theingenious toil, the wise are full of care; the good-for-nothing seek fornothing, they feed on vegetables, and roam where they list; they wanderpurposeless like a boat not made fast!' 'The mountain trees,' the textgoes on to say, 'lead to their own devastation; the spring (conduces) toits own plunder; and so on." And the more he therefore indulged inreflection, the more depressed he felt. "Now there are only these fewgirls," he proceeded to ponder minutely, "and yet, I'm unable to treatthem in such a way as to promote perfect harmony; and what will Iforsooth do by and by (when there will be more to deal with)!"
When he had reached this point in his cogitations, (he decided) that itwas really of no avail to agree with her, so that turning round, he wasmaking his way all alone into his apartments; but Lin Tai-y�, uponnoticing that he had left her side, readily concluded that reflectionhad marred his spirits and that he had so thoroughly lost his temper asto be going without even giving vent to a single word, and she could notrestrain herself from feeling inwardly more and more irritated. "Afteryou've gone this time," she hastily exclaimed, "don't come again, evenfor a whole lifetime; and I won't have you either so much as speak tome!"
Pao-y� paid no heed to her, but came back to his rooms, and layinghimself down on his bed, he kept on muttering in a state of chagrin; andthough Hsi Jen knew full well the reasons of his dejection, she found itdifficult to summon up courage to say anything to him at the moment, andshe had no alternative but to try and distract him by means ofirrelevant matters. "The theatricals which you've seen to-day," sheconsequently observed smiling, "will again lead to performances forseveral days, and Miss Pao-ch'ai will, I'm sure, give a return feast."
"Whether she gives a return feast or not," Pao-y� rejoined with anapathetic smirk, "is no concern of mine!"
When Hsi Jen perceived the tone, so unlike that of other days, withwhich these words were pronounced: "What's this that you're saying?" shetherefore remarked as she gave another smile. "In this pleasant andpropitious first moon, when all the ladies and young ladies are in highglee, how is it that you're again in a mood of this sort?"
"Whether the ladies and my cousins be in high spirits or not," Pao-y�replied forcing a grin, "is also perfectly immaterial to me."
"They are all," Hsi Jen added, smilingly, "pleasant and agreeable, andwere you also a little pleasant and agreeable, wouldn't it conduce tothe enjoyment of the whole company?"
"What about the whole company, and they and I?" Pao-y� urged. "They allhave their mutual friendships; while I, poor fellow, all forlorn, havenone to care a rap for me."
His remarks had reached this clause, when inadvertently the tearstrickled down; and Hsi Jen realising the state of mind he was in, didnot venture to say anything further. But as soon as Pao-y� had reflectedminutely over the sense and import of this sentence, he could notrefrain from bursting forth into a loud fit of crying, and, turninghimself round, he stood up, and, drawing near the table, he took up thepencil, and eagerly composed these enigmatical lines:
  If thou wert me to test, and I were thee to test,  Our hearts were we to test, and our minds to test,  When naught more there remains for us to test  That will yea very well be called a test,  And when there's naught to put, we could say, to the test,  We will a place set up on which our feet to rest.
After he had finished writing, he again gave way to fears that though hehimself could unfold their meaning, others, who came to peruse theselines, would not be able to fathom them, and he also went onconsequently to indite another stanza, in imitation of the "ParasiticPlant," which he inscribed at the close of the enigma; and when he hadread it over a second time, he felt his heart so free of all concernthat forthwith he got into his bed, and went to sleep.
But, who would have thought it, Tai-y�, upon seeing Pao-y� take hisdeparture in such an abrupt manner, designedly made use of the excusethat she was bent upon finding Hsi Jen, to come round and see what hewas up to.
"He's gone to sleep long ago!" Hsi Jen replied.
At these words, Tai-y� felt inclined to betake herself back at once; butHsi Jen smiled and said: "Please stop, miss. Here's a slip of paper, andsee what there is on it!" and speedily taking what Pao-y� had written ashort while back, she handed it over to Tai-y� to examine. Tai-y�, onperusal, discovered that Pao-y� had composed it, at the spur of themoment, when under the influence of resentment; and she could not helpthinking it both a matter of ridicule as well as of regret; but shehastily explained to Hsi Jen: "This is written for fun, and there'snothing of any consequence in it!" and having concluded this remark, shereadily took it along with her to her room, where she conned it over incompany with Hsiang-y�n; handing it also the next day to Pao-ch'ai toperuse. The burden of what Pao-ch'ai read was:
  In what was no concern of mine, I should to thee have paid no heed,  For while I humour this, that one to please I don't succeed!  Act as thy wish may be! go, come whene'er thou list; 'tis naught to      me.  Sorrow or joy, without limit or bound, to indulge thou art free!  What is this hazy notion about relatives distant or close?  For what purpose have I for all these days racked my heart with woes?  Even at this time when I look back and think, my mind no pleasure      knows.
After having finished its perusal, she went on to glance at theBuddhistic stanza, and smiling: "This being," she soliloquised; "hasawakened to a sense of perception; and all through my fault, for it'sthat ballad of mine yesterday which has incited this! But the subtledevices in all these rationalistic books have a most easy tendency tounsettle the natural disposition, and if to-morrow he does actually getup, and talk a lot of insane trash, won't his having fostered this ideaowe its origin to that ballad of mine; and shan't I have become theprime of all guilty people?"
Saying this, she promptly tore the paper, and, delivering the pieces tothe servant girls, she bade them go at once and burn them.
"You shouldn't have torn it!" Tai-y� remonstrated laughingly. "But waitand I'll ask him about it! so come along all of you, and I vouch I'llmake him abandon that idiotic frame of mind and that depraved language."
The three of them crossed over, in point of fact, into Pao-y�'s room,and Tai-y� was the first to smile and observe. "Pao-y�, may I ask yousomething? What is most valuable is a precious thing; and what is mostfirm is jade, but what value do you possess and what firmness is innatein you?"
But as Pao-y� could not, say anything by way of reply, two of themremarked sneeringly: "With all this doltish bluntness of his will heafter all absorb himself in abstraction?" While Hsiang-y�n also clappedher hands and laughed, "Cousin Pao has been discomfited."
"The latter part of that apothegm of yours," Tai-y� continued, "says:
 "We would then find some place on which our feet to rest.
"Which is certainly good; but in my view, its excellence is not as yetcomplete! and I should still tag on two lines at its close;" as sheproceeded to recite:
 "If we do not set up some place on which our feet to rest,  For peace and freedom then it will be best."
"There should, in very truth, be this adjunct to make it thoroughlyexplicit!" Pao-ch'ai added. "In days of yore, the sixth founder of theSouthern sect, Hui Neng, came, when he went first in search of hispatron, in the Shao Chou district; and upon hearing that the fifthfounder, Hung Jen, was at Huang Mei, he readily entered his service inthe capacity of Buddhist cook; and when the fifth founder, prompted by awish to select a Buddhistic successor, bade his neophytes and all thebonzes to each compose an enigmatical stanza, the one who occupied theupper seat, Shen Hsiu, recited:
 "A P'u T'i tree the body is, the heart so like a stand of mirror      bright,  On which must needs, by constant careful rubbing, not be left dust to      alight!
"And Hui Neng, who was at this time in the cook-house pounding rice,overheard this enigma. 'Excellent, it is excellent,' he ventured, 'butas far as completeness goes it isn't complete;' and having bethoughthimself of an apothegm: 'The P'u T'i, (an expression for Buddha orintelligence),' he proceeded, 'is really no tree; and the resplendentmirror, (Buddhistic term for heart), is likewise no stand; and as, infact, they do not constitute any tangible objects, how could they becontaminated by particles of dust?' Whereupon the fifth founder at oncetook his robe and clap-dish and handed them to him. Well, the text nowof this enigma presents too this identical idea, for the simple fact isthat those lines full of subtleties of a short while back are not, asyet, perfected or brought to an issue, and do you forsooth readily giveup the task in this manner?"
"He hasn't been able to make any reply," Tai-y� rejoined sneeringly,"and must therefore be held to be discomfited; but were he even to makesuitable answer now, there would be nothing out of the common about it!Anyhow, from this time forth you mustn't talk about Buddhistic spells,for what even we two know and are able to do, you don't as yet know andcan't do; and do you go and concern yourself with abstraction?"
Pao-y� had, in his own mind, been under the impression that he hadattained perception, but when he was unawares and all of a suddensubjected to this question by Tai-y�, he soon found it beyond his powerto give any ready answer. And when Pao-ch'ai furthermore came out with areligious disquisition, by way of illustration, and this on subjects, inall of which he had hitherto not seen them display any ability, hecommuned within himself: "If with their knowledge, which is indeed inadvance of that of mine, they haven't, as yet, attained perception, whatneed is there for me now to bring upon myself labour and vexation?"
"Who has, pray," he hastily inquired smilingly, after arriving at theend of his reflections, "indulged in Buddhistic mysteries? what I didamounts to nothing more than nonsensical trash, written, at the spur ofthe moment, and nothing else."
At the close of this remark all four came to be again on the same termsas of old; but suddenly a servant announced that the Empress (Y�anCh'un) had despatched a messenger to bring over a lantern-conundrum withthe directions that they should all go and guess it, and that after theyhad found it out, they should each also devise one and send it in. Atthese words, the four of them left the room with hasty step, andadjourned into dowager lady Chia's drawing room, where they discovered ayoung eunuch, holding a four-cornered, flat-topped lantern, of whitegauze, which had been specially fabricated for lantern riddles. On thefront side, there was already a conundrum, and the whole company werevying with each other in looking at it and making wild guesses; when theyoung eunuch went on to transmit his orders, saying: "Young ladies, youshould not speak out when you are guessing; but each one of you shouldsecretly write down the solutions for me to wrap them up, and take themall in together to await her Majesty's personal inspection as to whetherthey be correct or not."
Upon listening to these words, Pao-ch'ai drew near, and perceived at aglance, that it consisted of a stanza of four lines, with sevencharacters in each; but though there was no novelty or remarkablefeature about it, she felt constrained to outwardly give utterance towords of praise. "It's hard to guess!" she simply added, while shepretended to be plunged in thought, for the fact is that as soon as shehad cast her eye upon it, she had at once solved it. Pao-y�, Tai-y�,Hsiang-y�n, and T'an-ch'un, had all four also hit upon the answer, andeach had secretly put it in writing; and Chia Huan, Chia Lan and theothers were at the same time sent for, and every one of them set to workto exert the energies of his mind, and, when they arrived at a guess,they noted it down on paper; after which every individual member of thefamily made a choice of some object, and composed a riddle, which wastranscribed in a large round hand, and affixed on the lantern. Thisdone, the eunuch took his departure, and when evening drew near, he cameout and delivered the commands of the imperial consort. "The conundrum,"he said, "written by Her Highness, the other day, has been solved byevery one, with the exception of Miss Secunda and master Tertius, whomade a wrong guess. Those composed by you, young ladies, have likewiseall been guessed; but Her Majesty does not know whether her solutionsare right or not." While speaking, he again produced the riddles, whichhad been written by them, among which were those which had been solved,as well as those which had not been solved; and the eunuch, in likemanner, took the presents, conferred by the imperial consort, and handedthem over to those who had guessed right. To each person was assigned abamboo vase, inscribed with verses, which had been manufactured forpalace use, as well as articles of bamboo for tea; with the exception ofYing-ch'un and Chia Huan, who were the only two persons who did notreceive any. But as Ying-ch'un looked upon the whole thing as a joke anda trifle, she did not trouble her mind on that score, but Chia Huan atonce felt very disconsolate.
"This one devised by Mr. Tertius," the eunuch was further heard to say,"is not properly done; and as Her Majesty herself has been unable toguess it she commanded me to bring it back, and ask Mr. Tertius what itis about."
After the party had listened to these words, they all pressed forward tosee what had been written. The burden of it was this:
  The elder brother has horns only eight;  The second brother has horns only two;  The elder brother on the bed doth sit;  Inside the room the second likes to squat.
After perusal of these lines, they broke out, with one voice, into aloud fit of laughter; and Chia Huan had to explain to the eunuch thatthe one was a pillow, and the other the head of an animal. Havingcommitted the explanation to memory and accepted a cup of tea, theeunuch took his departure; and old lady Chia, noticing in what buoyantspirits Y�an Ch'un was, felt herself so much the more elated, thatissuing forthwith directions to devise, with every despatch, a small butingenious lantern of fine texture in the shape of a screen, and put itin the Hall, she bade each of her grandchildren secretly compose aconundrum, copy it out clean, and affix it on the frame of the lantern;and she had subsequently scented tea and fine fruits, as well as everykind of nicknacks, got ready, as prizes for those who guessed right.
And when Chia Cheng came from court and found the old lady in such highglee he also came over in the evening, as the season was furthermoreholiday time, to avail himself of her good cheer to reap some enjoyment.In the upper part of the room seated themselves, at one table dowagerlady Chia, Chia Cheng, and Pao-y�; madame Wang, Pao-ch'ai, Tai-y�,Hsiang-y�n sat round another table, and Ying-ch'un, Tan-ch'un and HsiCh'un the three of them, occupied a separate table, and both thesetables were laid in the lower part, while below, all over the floor,stood matrons and waiting-maids for Li Kung-ts'ai and Hsi-feng were bothseated in the inner section of the Hall, at another table.
Chia Chen failed to see Chia Lan, and he therefore inquired: "How is itI don't see brother Lan," whereupon the female servants, standing below,hastily entered the inner room and made inquiries of widow Li. "Hesays," Mrs. Li stood up and rejoined with a smile, "that as your masterdidn't go just then to ask him round, he has no wish to come!" and whena matron delivered the reply to Chia Cheng; the whole company exclaimedmuch amused: "How obstinate and perverse his natural disposition is!"But Chia Cheng lost no time in sending Chia Huan, together with twomatrons, to fetch Chia Lan; and, on his arrival, dowager lady Chia badehim sit by her side, and, taking a handful of fruits, she gave them tohim to eat; after which the party chatted, laughed, and enjoyedthemselves.
Ordinarily, there was no one but Pao-y� to say much or talk at anylength, but on this day, with Chia Cheng present, his remarks werelimited to assents. And as to the rest, Hsiang-y�n had, though a younggirl, and of delicate physique, nevertheless ever been very fond oftalking and discussing; but, on this instance, Chia Cheng was at thefeast, so that she also held her tongue and restrained her words. As forTai-y� she was naturally peevish and listless, and not very muchinclined to indulge in conversation; while Pao-ch'ai, who had never beenreckless in her words or frivolous in her deportment, likewise behavedon the present occasion in her usual dignified manner. Hence it was thatthis banquet, although a family party, given for the sake of relaxation,assumed contrariwise an appearance of restraint, and as old lady Chiawas herself too well aware that it was to be ascribed to the presence ofChia Cheng alone, she therefore, after the wine had gone round threetimes, forthwith hurried off Chia Cheng to retire to rest.
No less cognisant was Chia Cheng himself that the old lady's motives inpacking him off were to afford a favourable opportunity to the youngladies and young men to enjoy themselves, and that is why, forcing asmile, he observed: "Having to-day heard that your venerable ladyshiphad got up in here a large assortment of excellent riddles, on theoccasion of the spring festival of lanterns, I too consequently preparedprizes, as well as a banquet, and came with the express purpose ofjoining the company; and why don't you in some way confer a fraction ofthe fond love, which you cherish for your grandsons and granddaughters,upon me also, your son?"
"When you're here," old lady Chia replied smilingly, "they won't ventureto chat or laugh; and unless you go, you'll really fill me with intensedejection! But if you feel inclined to guess conundrums, well, I'll tellyou one for you to solve; but if you don't guess right, mind, you'll bemulcted!"
"Of course I'll submit to the penalty," Chia Cheng rejoined eagerly, ashe laughed, "but if I do guess right, I must in like manner receive areward!"
"This goes without saying!" dowager lady Chia added; whereupon she wenton to recite:
  The monkey's body gently rests on the tree top!
"This refers," she said, "to the name of a fruit."
Chia Cheng was already aware that it was a lichee, but he designedlymade a few guesses at random, and was fined several things; but hesubsequently gave, at length, the right answer, and also obtained apresent from her ladyship.
In due course he too set forth this conundrum for old lady Chia toguess:
  Correct its body is in appearance,  Both firm and solid is it in substance;  To words, it is true, it cannot give vent,  But spoken to, it always does assent.
When he had done reciting it, he communicated the answer in an undertoneto Pao-y�; and Pao-y� fathoming what his intention was, gently too toldhis grandmother Chia, and her ladyship finding, after some reflection,that there was really no mistake about it, readily remarked that it wasan inkslab.
"After all," Chia Cheng smiled; "Your venerable ladyship it is who canhit the right answer with one guess!" and turning his head round, "Bequick," he cried, "and bring the prizes and present them!" whereupon themarried women and waiting-maids below assented with one voice, and theysimultaneously handed up the large trays and small boxes.
Old lady Chia passed the things, one by one, under inspection; andfinding that they consisted of various kinds of articles, novel andingenious, of use and of ornament, in vogue during the lantern festival,her heart was so deeply elated that with alacrity she shouted, "Pour aglass of wine for your master!"
Pao-y� took hold of the decanter, while Ying Ch'un presented the cup ofwine.
"Look on that screen!" continued dowager lady Chia, "all those riddleshave been written by the young ladies; so go and guess them for mybenefit!"
Chia Cheng signified his obedience, and rising and walking up to thefront of the screen, he noticed the first riddle, which was one composedby the Imperial consort Y�an, in this strain:
  The pluck of devils to repress in influence it abounds,  Like bound silk is its frame, and like thunder its breath resounds.  But one report rattles, and men are lo! in fear and dread;  Transformed to ashes 'tis what time to see you turn the head.
"Is this a cracker?" Chia Cheng inquired.
"It is," Pao-y� assented.
Chia Cheng then went on to peruse that of Ying-Ch'un's, which referredto an article of use:
  Exhaustless is the principle of heavenly calculations and of human      skill;  Skill may exist, but without proper practice the result to find hard      yet  will be!  Whence cometh all this mixed confusion on a day so still?  Simply it is because the figures Yin and Yang do not agree.
"It's an abacus," Chia Cheng observed.
"Quite so!" replied Ying Ch'un smiling; after which they also conned theone below, by T'an-ch'un, which ran thus and had something to do with anobject:
  This is the time when 'neath the stairs the pages their heads raise!  The term of "pure brightness" is the meetest time this thing to make!  The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays!  The East wind don't begrudge because its farewell it did take!
"It would seem," Chia Cheng suggested, "as if that must be a kite!"
"It is," answered T'an C'h'un; whereupon Chia Cheng read the one below,which was written by Tai-y� to this effect and bore upon some thing:
  After the audience, his two sleeves who brings with fumes replete?  Both by the lute and in the quilt, it lacks luck to abide!  The dawn it marks; reports from cock and man renders effete!  At midnight, maids no trouble have a new one to provide!  The head, it glows during the day, as well as in the night!  Its heart, it burns from day to day and 'gain from year to year!  Time swiftly flies and mete it is that we should hold it dear!  Changes might come, but it defies wind, rain, days dark or bright!
"Isn't this a scented stick to show the watch?" Chia Cheng inquired.
"Yes!" assented Pao-y�, speaking on Tai-y�'s behalf; and Chia Chengthereupon prosecuted the perusal of a conundrum, which ran as follows,and referred to an object;
  With the South, it sits face to face,  And the North, the while, it doth face;  If the figure be sad, it also is sad,  If the figure be glad, it likewise is glad!
"Splendid! splendid!" exclaimed Chia Cheng, "my guess is that it's alooking-glass. It's excellently done!"
Pao-y� smiled. "It is a looking glass!" he rejoined.
"This is, however, anonymous; whose work is it?" Chia Cheng went on toask, and dowager lady Chia interposed: "This, I fancy, must have beencomposed by Pao-y�," and Chia Cheng then said not a word, but continuedreading the following conundrum, which was that devised by Pao-ch'ai, onsome article or other:
  Eyes though it has; eyeballs it has none, and empty 'tis inside!  The lotus flowers out of the water peep, and they with gladness meet,  But when dryandra leaves begin to drop, they then part and divide,  For a fond pair they are, but, united, winter they cannot greet.
When Chia Cheng finished scanning it, he gave way to reflection. "Thisobject," he pondered, "must surely be limited in use! But for persons oftender years to indulge in all this kind of language, would seem to bestill less propitious; for they cannot, in my views, be any of them thesort of people to enjoy happiness and longevity!" When his reflectionsreached this point, he felt the more dejected, and plainly betrayed asad appearance, and all he did was to droop his head and to plunge in abrown study.
But upon perceiving the frame of mind in which Chia Cheng was, dowagerlady Chia arrived at the conclusion that he must be fatigued; andfearing, on the other hand, that if she detained him, the whole party ofyoung ladies would lack the spirit to enjoy themselves, she there andthen faced Chia Cheng and suggested: "There's no need really for you toremain here any longer, and you had better retire to rest; and let ussit a while longer; after which, we too will break up!"
As soon as Chia Cheng caught this hint, he speedily assented severalconsecutive yes's; and when he had further done his best to induce oldlady Chia to have a cup of wine, he eventually withdrew out of the Hall.On his return to his bedroom, he could do nothing else than give way tocogitation, and, as he turned this and turned that over in his mind, hegot still more sad and pained.
"Amuse yourselves now!" readily exclaimed dowager lady Chia, during thiswhile, after seeing Chia Cheng off; but this remark was barely finished,when she caught sight of Pao-y� run up to the lantern screen, and givevent, as he gesticulated with his hands and kicked his feet about, toany criticisms that first came to his lips. "In this," he remarked,"this line isn't happy; and that one, hasn't been suitably solved!"while he behaved just like a monkey, whose fetters had been let loose.
"Were the whole party after all," hastily ventured Tai-y�, "to sit down,as we did a short while back and chat and laugh; wouldn't that be morein accordance with good manners?"
Lady Feng thereupon egressed from the room in the inner end andinterposed her remarks. "Such a being as you are," she said, "shouldn'tsurely be allowed by Mr. Chia Cheng, an inch or a step from his side,and then you'll be all right. But just then it slipped my memory, forwhy didn't I, when your father was present, instigate him to bid youcompose a rhythmical enigma; and you would, I have no doubt, have beenup to this moment in a state of perspiration!"
At these words, Pao-y� lost all patience, and laying hold of lady Feng,he hustled her about for a few moments.
But old lady Chia went on for some time to bandy words with LiKung-ts'ai, with the whole company of young ladies and the rest, so thatshe, in fact, felt considerably tired and worn out; and when she heardthat the fourth watch had already drawn nigh, she consequently issueddirections that the eatables should be cleared away and given to thecrowd of servants, and suggested, as she readily rose to her feet, "Letus go and rest! for the next day is also a feast, and we must get up atan early hour; and to-morrow evening we can enjoy ourselves again!"whereupon the whole company dispersed.
But now, reader, listen to the sequel given in the chapter whichfollows.

CHAPTER XXIII.
  Pao-y� and Tai-y� make use of some beautiful passages from the Record      of the Western Side-building to bandy jokes.  The excellent ballads sung in the Peony Pavilion touch the tender      heart of Tai-y�.
Soon after the day on which Chia Yuan-ch'un honoured the garden of BroadVista with a visit, and her return to the Palace, so our story goes, sheforthwith desired that T'an-ch'un should make a careful copy, inconsecutive order, of the verses, which had been composed and read outon that occasion, in order that she herself should assign them theirrank, and adjudge the good and bad. And she also directed that aninscription should be engraved on a stone, in the Broad Vista park, toserve in future years as a record of the pleasant and felicitous event;and Chia Cheng, therefore, gave orders to servants to go far and wide,and select skilful artificers and renowned workmen, to polish the stoneand engrave the characters in the garden of Broad Vista; while Chia Chenput himself at the head of Chia Jung, Chia P'ing and others tosuperintend the work. And as Chia Se had, on the other hand, the controlof Wen Kuan and the rest of the singing girls, twelve in all, as well asof their costumes and other properties, he had no leisure to attend toanything else, and consequently once again sent for Chia Ch'ang and ChiaLing to come and act as overseers.
On a certain day, the works were taken in hand for rubbing the stonessmooth with wax, for carving the inscription, and tracing it withvermilion, but without entering into details on these matters toominutely, we will return to the two places, the Yu Huang temple and theTa Mo monastery. The company of twelve young bonzes and twelve youngTaoist priests had now moved out of the Garden of Broad Vista, and ChiaCheng was meditating upon distributing them to various temples to liveapart, when unexpectedly Chia Ch'in's mother, n�e Chou,--who resided inthe back street, and had been at the time contemplating to pay a visitto Chia Cheng on this side so as to obtain some charge, be it eitherlarge or small, for her son to look after, that he too should be put inthe way of turning up some money to meet his expenses with,--came, asluck would have it, to hear that some work was in hand in this mansion,and lost no time in driving over in a curricle and making her appeal tolady Feng. And as lady Feng remembered that she had all along notpresumed on her position to put on airs, she willingly acceded to herrequest, and after calling to memory some suitable remarks, she at oncewent to make her report to madame Wang: "These young bonzes and Taoistpriests," she said, "can by no means be sent over to other places; forwere the Imperial consort to come out at an unexpected moment, theywould then be required to perform services; and in the event of theirbeing scattered, there will, when the time comes to requisition theirhelp, again be difficulties in the way; and my idea is that it would bebetter to send them all to the family temple, the Iron Fence Temple; andevery month all there will be to do will be to depute some one to takeover a few taels for them to buy firewood and rice with, that's all, andwhen there's even a sound of their being required uttered, some one canat once go and tell them just one word 'come,' and they will comewithout the least trouble!"
Madame Wang gave a patient ear to this proposal, and, in due course,consulted with Chia Cheng.
"You've really," smiled Chia Cheng at these words, "reminded me how Ishould act! Yes, let this be done!" And there and then he sent for ChiaLien.
Chia Lien was, at the time, having his meal with lady Feng, but as soonas he heard that he was wanted, he put by his rice and was just walkingoff, when lady Feng clutched him and pulled him back. "Wait a while,"she observed with a smirk, "and listen to what I've got to tell you! ifit's about anything else, I've nothing to do with it; but if it be aboutthe young bonzes and young Taoists, you must, in this particular matter,please comply with this suggestion of mine," after which, she went on inthis way and that way to put him up to a whole lot of hints.
"I know nothing about it," Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, "and as youhave the knack you yourself had better go and tell him!"
But as soon as lady Feng heard this remark, she stiffened her head andthrew down the chopsticks; and, with an expression on her cheeks, whichlooked like a smile and yet not a smile, she glanced angrily at ChiaLien. "Are you speaking in earnest," she inquired, "or are you onlyjesting?"
"Y�n Erh, the son of our fifth sister-in-law of the western porch, hascome and appealed to me two or three times, asking for something to lookafter," Chia Lien laughed, "and I assented and bade him wait; and now,after a great deal of trouble, this job has turned up; and there you areonce again snatching it away!"
"Compose your mind," lady Feng observed grinning, "for the ImperialConsort has hinted that directions should be given for the planting, inthe north-east corner of the park, of a further plentiful supply of pineand cedar trees, and that orders should also be issued for the addition,round the base of the tower, of a large number of flowers and plants andsuch like; and when this job turns up, I can safely tell you that YunErh will be called to assume control of these works."
"Well if that be really so," Chia Lien rejoined, "it will after all do!But there's only one thing; all I was up to last night was simply tohave some fun with you, but you obstinately and perversely wouldn't."
Lady Feng, upon hearing these words, burst out laughing with a sound ofCh'ih, and spurting disdainfully at Chia Lien, she lowered her head andwent on at once with her meal; during which time Chia Lien speedilywalked away laughing the while, and betook himself to the front, wherehe saw Chia Cheng. It was, indeed, about the young bonzes, and Chia Lienreadily carried out lady Feng's suggestion. "As from all appearances,"he continued, "Ch'in Erh has, actually, so vastly improved, this jobshould, after all, be entrusted to his care and management; and providedthat in observance with the inside custom Ch'in Erh were each day toldto receive the advances, things will go on all right." And as Chia Chenghad never had much attention to give to such matters of detail, he, assoon as he heard what Chia Lien had to say, immediately signified hisapproval and assent. And Chia Lien, on his return to his quarters,communicated the issue to lady Feng; whereupon lady Feng at once sentsome one to go and notify dame Chou.
Chia Ch'in came, in due course, to pay a visit to Chia Lien and hiswife, and was incessant in his expressions of gratitude; and lady Fengbestowed upon him a further favour by giving him, as a first instalment,an advance of the funds necessary for three months' outlay, for whichshe bade him write a receipt; while Chia Lien filled up a cheque andsigned it; and a counter-order was simultaneously issued, and he cameout into the treasury where the sum specified for three months'supplies, amounting to three hundred taels, was paid out in pure ingots.
Chia Ch'in took the first piece of silver that came under his hand, andgave it to the men in charge of the scales, with which he told them tohave a cup of tea, and bidding, shortly after, a boy-servant take themoney to his home, he held consultation with his mother; after which, hehired a donkey for himself to ride on, and also bespoke severalcarriages, and came to the back gate of the Jung Kuo mansion; wherehaving called out the twenty young priests, they got into the carriages,and sped straightway beyond the city walls, to the Temple of the IronFence, where nothing of any note transpired at the time.
But we will now notice Chia Y�an-ch'un, within the precincts of thePalace. When she had arranged the verses composed in the park of BroadVista in their order of merit, she suddenly recollected that the sightsin the garden were sure, ever since her visit through them, to bediligently and respectfully kept locked up by her father and mother; andthat by not allowing any one to go in was not an injustice done to thisgarden? "Besides," (she pondered), "in that household, there are atpresent several young ladies, capable of composing odes, and able towrite poetry, and why should not permission be extended to them to goand take their quarters in it; in order too that those winsome personsmight not be deprived of good cheer, and that the flowers and willowsmay not lack any one to admire them!"
But remembering likewise that Pao-y� had from his infancy grown up amongthat crowd of female cousins, and was such a contrast to the rest of hismale cousins that were he not allowed to move into it, he would, shealso apprehended, be made to feel forlorn; and dreading lest hisgrandmother and his mother should be displeased at heart, she thought itimperative that he too should be permitted to take up his quartersinside, so that things should be put on a satisfactory footing; anddirecting the eunuch Hsia Chung to go to the Jung mansion and deliverher commands, she expressed the wish that Pao-ch'ai and the other girlsshould live in the garden and that it should not be kept closed, andurged that Pao-y� should also shift into it, at his own pleasure, forthe prosecution of his studies. And Chia Cheng and madame Wang, uponreceiving her commands, hastened, after the departure of Hsia Chung, toexplain them to dowager lady Chia, and to despatch servants into thegarden to tidy every place, to dust, to sweep, and to lay out theportieres and bed-curtains. The tidings were heard by the rest even withperfect equanimity, but Pao-y� was immoderately delighted; and he wasengaged in deliberation with dowager lady Chia as to this necessary andto that requirement, when suddenly they descried a waiting-maid arrive,who announced: "Master wishes to see Pao-y�."
Pao-y� gazed vacantly for a while. His spirits simultaneously were sweptaway; his countenance changed colour; and clinging to old lady Chia, hereadily wriggled her about, just as one would twist the sugar (to makesweetmeats with), and could not, for the very death of him, summon upcourage to go; so that her ladyship had no alternative but to try andreassure him. "My precious darling" she urged, "just you go, and I'llstand by you! He won't venture to be hard upon you; and besides, you'vedevised these excellent literary compositions; and I presume as HerMajesty has desired that you should move into the garden, his object isto give you a few words of advice; simply because he fears that youmight be up to pranks in those grounds. But to all he tells you,whatever you do, mind you acquiesce and it will be all right!"
And as she tried to compose him, she at the same time called two oldnurses and enjoined them to take Pao-y� over with due care, "And don'tlet his father," she added, "frighten him!"
The old nurses expressed their obedience, and Pao-y� felt constrained towalk ahead; and with one step scarcely progressing three inches, heleisurely came over to this side. Strange coincidence Chia Cheng was inmadame Wang's apartments consulting with her upon some matter or other,and Chin Ch'uan-erh, Ts'ai Yun, Ts'ai Feng, Ts'ai Luan, Hsiu Feng andthe whole number of waiting-maids were all standing outside under theverandah. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-y�, they puckered up theirmouths and laughed at him; while Chin Ch'uan grasped Pao-y� with onehand, and remarked in a low tone of voice: "On these lips of mine hasjust been rubbed cosmetic, soaked with perfume, and are you now inclinedto lick it or not?" whereupon Ts'ai Y�n pushed off Chin Ch'uan with oneshove, as she interposed laughingly, "A person's heart is at this momentin low spirits and do you still go on cracking jokes at him? But availyourself of this opportunity when master is in good cheer to make hasteand get in!"
Pao-y� had no help but to sidle against the door and walk in. Chia Chengand madame Wang were, in fact, both in the inner rooms, and dame Chouraised the porti�re. Pao-y� stepped in gingerly and perceived Chia Chengand madame Wang sitting opposite to each other, on the stove-couch,engaged in conversation; while below on a row of chairs sat Ying Ch'un,T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan; but though all four of them wereseated in there only T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan rose to theirfeet, as soon as they saw him make his appearance in the room; and whenChia Cheng raised his eyes and noticed Pao-y� standing in front of him,with a gait full of ease and with those winsome looks of his, socaptivating, he once again realised what a mean being Chia Huan was, andhow coarse his deportment. But suddenly he also bethought himself ofChia Chu, and as he reflected too that madame Wang had only this son ofher own flesh and blood, upon whom she ever doated as upon a gem, andthat his own beard had already begun to get hoary, the consequence wasthat he unwittingly stifled, well nigh entirely, the feeling of hatredand dislike, which, during the few recent years he had ordinarilyfostered towards Pao-y�. And after a long pause, "Her Majesty," heobserved, "bade you day after day ramble about outside to disportyourself, with the result that you gradually became remiss and lazy; butnow her desire is that we should keep you under strict control, and thatin prosecuting your studies in the company of your cousins in thegarden, you should carefully exert your brains to learn; so that if youdon't again attend to your duties, and mind your regular tasks, you hadbetter be on your guard!" Pao-y� assented several consecutive yes's;whereupon madame Wang drew him by her side and made him sit down, andwhile his three cousins resumed the seats they previously occupied:"Have you finished all the pills you had been taking a short whileback?" madame Wang inquired, as she rubbed Pao-y�'s neck.
"There's still one pill remaining," Pao-y� explained by way of reply.
"You had better," madame Wang added, "fetch ten more pills tomorrowmorning; and every day about bedtime tell Hsi Jen to give them to you;and when you've had one you can go to sleep!"
"Ever since you, mother, bade me take them," Pao-y� rejoined, "Hsi Jenhas daily sent me one, when I was about to turn in."
"Who's this called Hsi Jen?" Chia Chen thereupon ascertained.
"She's a waiting-maid!" madame Wang answered.
"A servant girl," Chia Cheng remonstrated, "can be called by whatevername one chooses; anything is good enough; but who's it who has startedthis kind of pretentious name!"
Madame Wang noticed that Chia Cheng was not in a happy frame of mind, sothat she forthwith tried to screen matters for Pao-y�, by saying: "It'sour old lady who has originated it!"
"How can it possibly be," Chia Cheng exclaimed, "that her ladyship knowsanything about such kind of language? It must, for a certainty, bePao-y�!"
Pao-y� perceiving that he could not conceal the truth from him, wasunder the necessity of standing up and of explaining; "As I have allalong read verses, I remembered the line written by an old poet:
 "What time the smell of flowers wafts itself into man, one knows the      day is warm.
"And as this waiting-maid's surname was Hua (flower), I readily gave herthe name, on the strength of this sentiment."
"When you get back," madame Wang speedily suggested addressing Pao-y�,"change it and have done; and you, sir, needn't lose your temper oversuch a trivial matter!"
"It doesn't really matter in the least," Chia Cheng continued; "so thatthere's no necessity of changing it; but it's evident that Pao-y�doesn't apply his mind to legitimate pursuits, but mainly devotes hisenergies to such voluptuous expressions and wanton verses!" And as hefinished these words, he abruptly shouted out: "You brute-like child ofretribution! Don't you yet get out of this?"
"Get away, off with you!" madame Wang in like manner hastened to urge;"our dowager lady is waiting, I fear, for you to have her repast!"
Pao-y� assented, and, with gentle step, he withdrew out of the room,laughing at Chin Ch'uan-erh, as he put out his tongue; and leading offthe two nurses, he went off on his way like a streak of smoke. But nosooner had he reached the door of the corridor than he espied Hsi Jenstanding leaning against the side; who perceiving Pao-y� come back safeand sound heaped smile upon smile, and asked: "What did he want youfor?"
"There was nothing much," Pao-y� explained, "he simply feared that Iwould, when I get into the garden, be up to mischief, and he gave me allsorts of advice;" and, as while he explained matters, they came into thepresence of lady Chia, he gave her a clear account, from first to last,of what had transpired. But when he saw that Lin Tai-y� was at themoment in the room, Pao-y� speedily inquired of her: "Which place do youthink best to live in?"
Tai-y� had just been cogitating on this subject, so that when sheunexpectedly heard Pao-y�'s inquiry, she forthwith rejoined with asmile: "My own idea is that the Hsio Hsiang Kuan is best; for I'm fondof those clusters of bamboos, which hide from view the tortuousbalustrade and make the place more secluded and peaceful than anyother!"
Pao-y� at these words clapped his hands and smiled. "That just meetswith my own views!" he remarked; "I too would like you to go and live inthere; and as I am to stay in the I Hung Yuan, we two will be, in thefirst place, near each other; and next, both in quiet and secludedspots."
While the two of them were conversing, a servant came, sent over by ChiaCheng, to report to dowager lady Chia that: "The 22nd of the second moonwas a propitious day for Pao-y� and the young ladies to shift theirquarters into the garden; that during these few days, servants should besent in to put things in their proper places and to clean; that HsuehPao-ch'ai should put up in the Heng Wu court; that Lin Tai-y� was tolive in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge; that Chia Ying-ch'un should move intothe Cho Chin two-storied building; that T'an Ch'un should put up in theCh'iu Yen library; that Hsi Ch'un should take up her quarters in theLiao Feng house; that widow Li should live in the Tao Hsiang village,and that Pao-y� was to live in the I Hung court. That at every place twoold nurses should be added and four servant-girls; that exclusive of thenurse and personal waiting-maid of each, there should, in addition, beservants, whose special duties should be to put things straight and tosweep the place; and that on the 22nd, they should all, in a body, moveinto the garden."
When this season drew near, the interior of the grounds, with theflowers waving like embroidered sashes, and the willows fanned by thefragrant breeze, was no more as desolate and silent as it had been inprevious days; but without indulging in any further irrelevant details,we shall now go back to Pao-y�.
Ever since he shifted his quarters into the park, his heart was full ofjoy, and his mind of contentment, fostering none of those extraordinaryideas, whose tendency could be to give birth to longings and hankerings.Day after day, he simply indulged, in the company of his female cousinsand the waiting-maids, in either reading his books, or writingcharacters, or in thrumming the lute, playing chess, drawing picturesand scanning verses, even in drawing patterns of argus pheasants, inembroidering phoenixes, contesting with them in searching for strangeplants, and gathering flowers, in humming poetry with gentle tone,singing ballads with soft voice, dissecting characters, and in playingat mora, so that, being free to go everywhere and anywhere, he was ofcourse completely happy. From his pen emanate four ballads on the timesof the four seasons, which, although they could not be looked upon asfirst-rate, afford anyhow a correct idea of his sentiments, and a trueaccount of the scenery.
The ballad on the spring night runs as follows:
  The silken curtains, thin as russet silk, at random are spread out.  The croak of frogs from the adjoining lane but faintly strikes the      ear.  The pillow a slight chill pervades, for rain outside the window falls.  The landscape, which now meets the eye, is like that seen in dreams by      man.  In plenteous streams the candles' tears do drop, but for whom do they      weep?  Each particle of grief felt by the flowers is due to anger against me.  It's all because the maids have by indulgence indolent been made.  The cover over me I'll pull, as I am loth to laugh and talk for long.
This is the description of the aspect of nature on a summer night:
  The beauteous girl, weary of needlework, quiet is plunged in a long      dream.  The parrot in the golden cage doth shout that it is time the tea to      brew.  The lustrous windows with the musky moon like open palace-mirrors      look;  The room abounds with fumes of sandalwood and all kinds of imperial      scents.  From the cups made of amber is poured out the slippery dew from the      lotus.  The banisters of glass, the cool zephyr enjoy flapped by the willow      trees.  In the stream-spanning kiosk, the curtains everywhere all at one time      do wave.  In the vermilion tower the blinds the maidens roll, for they have made      the night's toilette.
The landscape of an autumnal evening is thus depicted:
  In the interior of the Chiang Y�n house are hushed all clamorous din      and noise.  The sheen, which from Selene flows, pervades the windows of carnation      gauze.  The moss-locked, streaked rocks shelter afford to the cranes, plunged      in sleep.  The dew, blown on the t'ung tree by the well, doth wet the roosting      rooks.  Wrapped in a quilt, the maid comes the gold phoenix coverlet to      spread.  The girl, who on the rails did lean, on her return drops the      kingfisher flowers!  This quiet night his eyes in sleep he cannot close, as he doth long      for wine.  The smoke is stifled, and the fire restirred, when tea is ordered to      be brewed.
The picture of a winter night is in this strain:
  The sleep of the plum trees, the dream of the bamboos the third watch      have already reached.  Under the embroidered quilt and the kingfisher coverlet one can't      sleep for the cold.  The shadow of fir trees pervades the court, but cranes are all that      meet the eye.  Both far and wide the pear blossom covers the ground, but yet the hawk      cannot be heard.  The wish, verses to write, fostered by the damsel with the green      sleeves, has wax�d cold.  The master, with the gold sable pelisse, cannot endure much wine.  But yet he doth rejoice that his attendant knows the way to brew the      tea.  The newly-fallen snow is swept what time for tea the water must be      boiled.
But putting aside Pao-y�, as he leisurely was occupied in scanning someverses, we will now allude to all these ballads. There lived, at thattime, a class of people, whose wont was to servilely court theinfluential and wealthy, and who, upon perceiving that the verses werecomposed by a young lad of the Jung Kuo mansion, of only twelve orthirteen years of age, had copies made, and taking them outside sangtheir praise far and wide. There were besides another sort oflight-headed young men, whose heart was so set upon licentious andseductive lines, that they even inscribed them on fans and screen-walls,and time and again kept on humming them and extolling them. And to theabove reasons must therefore be ascribed the fact that persons came insearch of stanzas and in quest of manuscripts, to apply for sketches andto beg for poetical compositions, to the increasing satisfaction ofPao-y�, who day after day, when at home, devoted his time and attentionto these extraneous matters. But who would have anticipated that hecould ever in his quiet seclusion have become a prey to a spirit ofrestlessness? Of a sudden, one day he began to feel discontent, findingfault with this and turning up his nose at that; and going in and comingout he was simply full of ennui. And as all the girls in the garden werejust in the prime of youth, and at a time of life when, artless andunaffected, they sat and reclined without regard to retirement, anddisported themselves and joked without heed, how could they ever havecome to read the secrets which at this time occupied a place in theheart of Pao-y�? But so unhappy was Pao-y� within himself that he soonfelt loth to stay in the garden, and took to gadding about outside likean evil spirit; but he behaved also the while in an idiotic manner.
Ming Yen, upon seeing him go on in this way, felt prompted, with theidea of affording his mind some distraction, to think of this and todevise that expedient; but everything had been indulged in with surfeitby Pao-y�, and there was only this resource, (that suggested itself tohim,) of which Pao-y� had not as yet had any experience. Bringing hisreflections to a close, he forthwith came over to a bookshop, andselecting novels, both of old and of the present age, traditionsintended for outside circulation on Fei Yen, Ho Te, Wu Tse-t'ien, andYang Kuei-fei, as well as books of light literature consisting ofstrange legends, he purchased a good number of them with the expresspurpose of enticing Pao-y� to read them. As soon as Pao-y� caught sightof them, he felt as if he had obtained some gem or jewel. "But youmustn't," Ming Yen went on to enjoin him, "take them into the garden;for if any one were to come to know anything about them, I shall thensuffer more than I can bear; and you should, when you go along, hidethem in your clothes!"
But would Pao-y� agree to not introducing them into the garden? So aftermuch wavering, he picked out only several volumes of those whose stylewas more refined, and took them in, and threw them over the top of hisbed for him to peruse when no one was present; while those coarse andvery indecent ones, he concealed in a bundle in the outer library.
On one day, which happened to be the middle decade of the third moon,Pao-y�, after breakfast, took a book, the "Hui Chen Chi," in his handand walked as far as the bridge of the Hsin Fang lock. Seating himselfon a block of rock, that lay under the peach trees in that quarter, heopened the Hui Chen Chi and began to read it carefully from thebeginning. But just as he came to the passage: "the falling red(flowers) have formed a heap," he felt a gust of wind blow through thetrees, bringing down a whole bushel of peach blossoms; and, as theyfell, his whole person, the entire surface of the book as well as alarge extent of ground were simply bestrewn with petals of the blossoms.Pao-y� was bent upon shaking them down; but as he feared lest theyshould be trodden under foot, he felt constrained to carry the petals inhis coat and walk to the bank of the pond and throw them into thestream. The petals floated on the surface of the water, and, afterwhirling and swaying here and there, they at length ran out by the HsinFang lock. But, on his return under the tree, he found the ground againone mass of petals, and Pao-y� was just hesitating what to do, when heheard some one behind his back inquire, "What are you up to here?" andas soon as Pao-y� turned his head round, he discovered that it was LinTai-y�, who had come over carrying on her shoulder a hoe for rakingflowers, that on this hoe was suspended a gauze-bag, and that in herhand she held a broom.
"That's right, well done!" Pao-y� remarked smiling; "come and sweepthese flowers, and throw them into the water yonder. I've just thrown alot in there myself!"
"It isn't right," Lin Tai-y� rejoined, "to throw them into the water.The water, which you see, is clean enough here, but as soon as it findsits way out, where are situated other people's grounds, what isn't therein it? so that you would be misusing these flowers just as much as ifyou left them here! But in that corner, I have dug a hole for flowers,and I'll now sweep these and put them into this gauze-bag and bury themin there; and, in course of many days, they will also become convertedinto earth, and won't this be a clean way (of disposing of them)?"
Pao-y�, after listening to these words, felt inexpressibly delighted."Wait!" he smiled, "until I put down my book, and I'll help you to clearthem up!"
"What's the book?" Tai-y� inquired.
Pao-y� at this question was so taken aback that he had no time toconceal it. "It's," he replied hastily, "the Chung Yung and the TaHs�eh!"
"Are you going again to play the fool with me? Be quick and give it tome to see; and this will be ever so much better a way!"
"Cousin," Pao-y� replied, "as far as you yourself are concerned I don'tmind you, but after you've seen it, please don't tell any one else. It'sreally written in beautiful style; and were you to once begin readingit, why even for your very rice you wouldn't have a thought?"
As he spoke, he handed it to her; and Tai-y� deposited all the flowerson the ground, took over the book, and read it from the very first page;and the more she perused it, she got so much the more fascinated by it,that in no time she had finished reading sixteen whole chapters. Butaroused as she was to a state of rapture by the diction, what remainedeven of the fascination was enough to overpower her senses; and thoughshe had finished reading, she nevertheless continued in a state ofabstraction, and still kept on gently recalling the text to mind, andhumming it to herself.
"Cousin, tell me is it nice or not?" Pao-y� grinned.
"It is indeed full of zest!" Lin Tai-y� replied exultingly.
"I'm that very sad and very sickly person," Pao-y� explained laughing,"while you are that beauty who could subvert the empire and overthrowthe city."
Lin Tai-y� became, at these words, unconsciously crimson all over hercheeks, even up to her very ears; and raising, at the same moment, hertwo eyebrows, which seemed to knit and yet not to knit, and opening widethose eyes, which seemed to stare and yet not to stare, while herpeach-like cheeks bore an angry look and on her thin-skinned face lurkeddispleasure, she pointed at Pao-y� and exclaimed: "You do deserve death,for the rubbish you talk! without any provocation you bring up theselicentious expressions and wanton ballads to give vent to all thisinsolent rot, in order to insult me; but I'll go and tell uncle andaunt."
As soon as she pronounced the two words "insult me," her eyeballs atonce were suffused with purple, and turning herself round she there andthen walked away; which filled Pao-y� with so much distress that hejumped forward to impede her progress, as he pleaded: "My dear cousin, Iearnestly entreat you to spare me this time! I've indeed said what Ishouldn't; but if I had any intention to insult you, I'll throw myselfto-morrow into the pond, and let the scabby-headed turtle eat me up, sothat I become transformed into a large tortoise. And when you shall haveby and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and youshall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, I'll cometo your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!"
As he uttered these words, Lin Tai-y� burst out laughing with a sound of"pu ch'ih," and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: "I too cancome out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talkingnonsense? Pshaw! you're, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks)like silver, (but is really soft as) wax!"
"Go on, go on!" Pao-y� smiled after this remark; "and what you've said,I too will go and tell!"
"You maintain," Lin Tai-y� rejoined sarcastically, "that after glancingat anything you're able to recite it; and do you mean to say that Ican't even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?"
Pao-y� smiled and put his book away, urging: "Let's do what's right andproper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don't let usallude to these things!"
Forthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no soonerhad they interred them properly than they espied Hsi Jen coming, whowent on to observe: "Where haven't I looked for you? What! have youfound your way as far as this! But our senior master, Mr. Chia She, overthere isn't well; and the young ladies have all gone over to pay theirrespects, and our old lady has asked that you should be sent over; so goback at once and change your clothes!"
When Pao-y� heard what she said, he hastily picked up his books, andsaying good bye to Tai-y�, he came along with Hsi Jen, back into hisroom, where we will leave him to effect the necessary change in hiscostume. But during this while, Lin Tai-y� was, after having seen Pao-y�walk away, and heard that all her cousins were likewise not in theirrooms, wending her way back alone, in a dull and dejected mood, towardsher apartment, when upon reaching the outside corner of the wall of thePear Fragrance court, she caught, issuing from inside the walls, theharmonious strains of the fife and the melodious modulations of voicessinging. Lin Tai-y� readily knew that it was the twelve singing-girlsrehearsing a play; and though she did not give her mind to go andlisten, yet a couple of lines were of a sudden blown into her ears, andwith such clearness, that even one word did not escape. Their burden wasthis:
  These troth are beauteous purple and fine carmine flowers, which in      this way all round do bloom,  And all together lie ensconced along the broken well, and the      dilapidated wall!
But the moment Lin Tai-y� heard these lines, she was, in fact, sointensely affected and agitated that she at once halted and lending anear listened attentively to what they went on to sing, which ran thus:
  A glorious day this is, and pretty scene, but sad I feel at heart!  Contentment and pleasure are to be found in whose family courts?
After overhearing these two lines, she unconsciously nodded her head,and sighed, and mused in her own mind. "Really," she thought, "there isfine diction even in plays! but unfortunately what men in this worldsimply know is to see a play, and they don't seem to be able to enjoythe beauties contained in them."
At the conclusion of this train of thought, she experienced again asting of regret, (as she fancied) she should not have given way to suchidle thoughts and missed attending to the ballads; but when she oncemore came to listen, the song, by some coincidence, went on thus:
  It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely      spring,  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.
When this couplet struck Tai-yu's ear, her heart felt suddenly a prey toexcitement and her soul to emotion; and upon further hearing the words:
  Alone you sit in the secluded inner rooms to self-compassion giving      way.
--and other such lines, she became still more as if inebriated, and likeas if out of her head, and unable to stand on her feet, she speedilystooped her body, and, taking a seat on a block of stone, she minutelypondered over the rich beauty of the eight characters:
  It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely      spring,  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.
Of a sudden, she likewise bethought herself of the line:
  Water flows away and flowers decay, for both no feelings have.
--which she had read some days back in a poem of an ancient writer, andalso of the passage:
  When on the running stream the flowers do fall, spring then is past      and gone;
--and of:
  Heaven (differs from) the human race,
--which also appeared in that work; and besides these, the lines, whichshe had a short while back read in the Hsi Hiang Chi:
  The flowers, lo, fall, and on their course the waters red do flow!  Petty misfortunes of ten thousand kinds (my heart assail!)
both simultaneously flashed through her memory; and, collating them alltogether, she meditated on them minutely, until suddenly her heart wasstricken with pain and her soul fleeted away, while from her eyestrickled down drops of tears. But while nothing could dispel her presentstate of mind, she unexpectedly realised that some one from behind gaveher a tap; and, turning her head round to look, she found that it was ayoung girl; but who it was, the next chapter will make known.

CHAPTER XXIV.
  The drunken Chin Kang makes light of lucre and shows a preference for      generosity.  The foolish girl mislays her handkerchief and arouses mutual thoughts.

But to return to our narrative. Lin Tai-y�'s sentimental reflectionswere the while reeling and ravelling in an intricate maze, whenunexpectedly some one from behind gave her a tap, saying: "What are youup to all alone here?" which took Lin Tai-yu so much by surprise thatshe gave a start, and turning her head round to look and noticing thatit was Hsiang Ling and no one else; "You stupid girl!" Lin Tai-y�replied, "you've given me such a fright! But where do you come from atthis time?"
Hsiang Ling giggled and smirked. "I've come," she added, "in search ofour young lady, but I can't find her anywhere. But your Tzu Chuan isalso looking after you; and she says that lady Secunda has sent apresent to you of some tea. But you had better go back home and sitdown."
As she spoke, she took Tai-y� by the hand, and they came along back tothe Hsiao Hsiang Kuan; where lady Feng had indeed sent her two smallcatties of a new season tea, of superior quality. But Lin Tai-y� satdown, in company with Hsiang Ling, and began to converse on the meritsof this tapestry and the fineness of that embroidery; and after they hadalso had a game at chess, and read a few sentences out of a book, HsiangLing took her departure. But we need not speak of either of them, butreturn now to Pao-y�. Having been found, and brought back home, by HsiJen, he discovered Yuan Yang reclining on the bed, in the act ofexamining Hsi Jen's needlework; but when she perceived Pao-y� arrive,she forthwith remarked: "Where have you been? her venerable ladyship iswaiting for you to tell you to go over and pay your obeisance to ourSenior master, and don't you still make haste to go and change yourclothes and be off!"
Hsi Jen at once walked into the room to fetch his clothes, and Pao-y�sat on the edge of the bed, and pushed his shoes off with his toes; and,while waiting for his boots to put them on, he turned round andperceiving that Y�an Yang, who was clad in a light red silk jacket and agreen satin waistcoat, and girdled with a white crepe sash, had her faceturned the other way, and her head lowered giving her attention to thecriticism of the needlework, while round her neck she wore a collar withembroidery, Pao-y� readily pressed his face against the nape of herneck, and as he sniffed the perfume about it, he did not stay his handfrom stroking her neck, which in whiteness and smoothness was not belowthat of Hsi Jen; and as he approached her, "My dear girl," he saidsmiling and with a drivelling face, "do let me lick the cosmetic offyour mouth!" clinging to her person, as he uttered these words, liketwisted sweetmeat.
"Hsi Jen!" cried Y�an Yang at once, "come out and see! You've been withhim a whole lifetime, and don't you give him any advice; but let himstill behave in this fashion!" Whereupon, Hsi Jen walked out, claspingthe clothes, and turning to Pao-y�, she observed, "I advise you in thisway and it's no good, I advise you in that way and you don't mend; andwhat do you mean to do after all? But if you again behave like this, itwill then, in fact, be impossible for me to live any longer in thisplace!"
As she tendered these words of counsel, she urged him to put his clotheson, and, after he had changed, he betook himself, along with Yuan Yang,to the front part of the mansion, and bade good-bye to dowager ladyChia; after which he went outside, where the attendants and horses wereall in readiness; but when he was about to mount his steed, he perceivedChia Lien back from his visit and in the act of dismounting; and as thetwo of them stood face to face, and mutually exchanged some inquiries,they saw some one come round from the side, and say: "My respects toyou, uncle Pao-y�!"
When Pao-y� came to look at him, he noticed that this person had anoblong face, that his body was tall and lanky, that his age was onlyeighteen or nineteen, and that he possessed, in real truth, an air ofrefinement and elegance; but though his features were, after all,exceedingly familiar, he could not recall to mind to what branch of thefamily he belonged, and what his name was.
"What are you staring vacantly for?" Chia Lien inquired laughing.
"Don't you even recognise him? He's Y�n Erh, the son of our fifthsister-in-law, who lives in the back court!"
"Of course!" Pao-y� assented complacently. "How is it that I hadforgotten just now!" And having gone on to ask how his mother was, andwhat work he had to do at present; "I've come in search of uncleSecundus, to tell him something," Chia Y�n replied, as he pointed atChia Lien.
"You've really improved vastly from what you were before," added Pao-y�smiling; "you verily look just is if you were my son!"
"How very barefaced!" Chia Lien exclaimed as he burst out laughing;"here's a person four or five years your senior to be made your son!"
"How far are you in your teens this year?" Pao-y� inquired with a smile.
"Eighteen!" Chia Y�n rejoined.
This Chia Y�n was, in real deed, sharp and quick-witted; and when heheard Pao-y� remark that he looked like his son, he readily gave asarcastic smile and observed, "The proverb is true which says, 'thegrandfather is rocked in the cradle while the grandson leans on astaff.' But though old enough in years, I'm nevertheless like amountain, which, in spite of its height, cannot screen the sun fromview. Besides, since my father's death, I've had no one to look afterme, and were you, uncle Pao, not to disdain your doltish nephew, and toacknowledge me as your son, it would be your nephew's good fortune!"
"Have you heard what he said?" Chia Lien interposed cynically. "But toacknowledge him as a son is no easy question to settle!" and with thesewords, he walked in; whereupon Pao-y� smilingly said: "To-morrow whenyou have nothing to do, just come and look me up; but don't go and playany devilish pranks with them! I've just now no leisure, so cometo-morrow, into the library, where I'll have a chat with you for a wholeday, and take you into the garden for some fun!"
With this remark still on his lips, he laid hold of the saddle andmounted his horse; and, followed by the whole bevy of pages, he crossedover to Chia She's on this side; where having discovered that Chia Shehad nothing more the matter with him than a chill which he had suddenlycontracted, he commenced by delivering dowager lady Chia's message, andnext paid his own obeisance. Chia She, at first, stood up and madesuitable answer to her venerable ladyship's inquiries, and then callinga servant, "Take the gentleman," he said, "into my lady's apartment tosit down."
Pao-y� withdrew out of the room, and came by the back to the upperapartment; and as soon as madame Hsing caught sight of him, she, beforeeverything else, rose to her feet and asked after old lady Chia'shealth; after which, Pao-y� made his own salutation, and madame Hsingdrew him on to the stove-couch, where she induced him to take a seat,and eventually inquired after the other inmates, and also gave orders toserve the tea. But scarcely had they had tea, before they perceived ChiaTsung come in to pay his respects to Pao-y�.
"Where could one find such a living monkey as this!" madame Hsingremarked; "is that nurse of yours dead and gone that she doesn't evenkeep you clean and tidy, and that she lets you go about with thoseeyebrows of yours so black and that mouth so filthy! you scarcely looklike the child of a great family of scholars."
While she spoke, she perceived both Chia Huan and Chia Lan, one of whomwas a young uncle and the other his nephew, also advance and presenttheir compliments, and madame Hsing bade the two of them sit down on thechairs. But when Chia Huan noticed that Pao-y� sat on the same rug withmadame Hsing, and that her ladyship was further caressing and pettinghim in every possible manner, he soon felt so very unhappy at heart,that, after sitting for a short time, he forthwith made a sign to ChiaLan that he would like to go; and as Chia Lan could not but humour him,they both got up together to take their leave. But when Pao-y� perceivedthem rise, he too felt a wish to go back along with them, but madameHsing remarked smilingly, "You had better sit a while as I've somethingmore to tell you," so that Pao-y� had no alternative but to stay. "Whenyou get back," madame Hsing added, addressing the other two, "present,each one of you, my regards to your respective mothers. The youngladies, your cousins, are all here making such a row that my head isdazed, so that I won't to-day keep you to have your repast here." Towhich Chia Huan and Chia Lan assented and quickly walked out.
"If it be really the case that all my cousins have come over," Pao-y�ventured with a smirk, "how is it that I don't see them?"
"After sitting here for a while," madame Hsing explained, "they all wentat the back; but in what rooms they have gone, I don't know."
"My senior aunt, you said you had something to tell me, Pao-y� observed;what's it, I wonder?"
"What can there possibly be to tell you?" madame Hsing laughed; "it wassimply to make you wait and have your repast with the young ladies andthen go; but there's also a fine plaything that I'll give you to takeback to amuse yourself with."
These two, the aunt and her nephew, were going on with their colloquywhen, much to their surprise, it was time for dinner and the youngladies were all invited to come. The tables and chairs were put in theirplaces, and the cups and plates were arranged in proper order; and,after the mother, her daughter and the cousins had finished their meal,Pao-y� bade good-bye to Chia She and returned home in company with allthe young ladies; and when they had said good-night to dowager ladyChia, madame Wang and the others, they each went back into their roomsand retired to rest; where we shall leave them without any furthercomment and speak of Chia Y�n's visit to the mansion. As soon as he sawChia Lien, he inquired what business it was that had turned up, and ChiaLien consequently explained: "The other day something did actuallypresent itself, but as it happened that your aunt had again and againentreated me, I gave it to Chia Ch'in; as she promised me that therewould be by and by in the garden several other spots where flowers andtrees would be planted; and that when this job did occur, she would, fora certainty, give it to you and finish!"
Chia Y�n, upon hearing these words, suggested after a short pause; "Ifthat be so, there's nothing for me to do than to wait; but, uncle, youtoo mustn't make any allusion beforehand in the presence of aunt to myhaving come to-day to make any inquiries; for there will really be ampletime to speak to her when the job turns up!"
"Why should I allude to it?" Chia Lien rejoined. "Have I forsooth gotall this leisure to talk of irrelevant matters! But to-morrow, besides,I've got to go as far as Hsing Yi for a turn, and it's absolutelynecessary that I should hurriedly come back the very same day; so offwith you now and go and wait; and the day after to-morrow, after thewatch has been set, come and ask for news; but mind at any earlier hour,I shan't have any leisure!" With these words, he hastily went at theback to change his clothes. And from the time Chia Yun put his foot outof the door of the Jung Kuo mansion, he was, the whole way homeward,plunged in deep thought; but having bethought himself of some expedient,he straightway wended his steps towards the house of his maternal uncle,Pu Shih-jen. This Pu Shih-jen, it must be explained, kept, at thepresent date, a shop for the sale of spices. He had just returned homefrom his shop, and as soon as he noticed Chia Yun, he inquired of himwhat business brought him there.
"There's something," Chia Yun replied, "in which I would like to craveyour assistance, uncle; I'm in need of some baroos camphor and musk, soplease, uncle, give me on credit four ounces of each kind, and on thefestival of the eighth moon, I'll bring you the amount in full."
Pu Shih-jen gave a sardonic smile. "Don't," he said, "again allude toany such thing as selling on tick! Some time back a partner in ourestablishment got several ounces of goods for his relatives on credit,and up to this date the bill hasn't as yet been settled; the resultbeing that we've all had to make the amount good, so that we've enteredinto an agreement that we should no more allow any one to obtain on tickanything on behalf of either relative or friend, and that whoever actedcontrary to this resolution should be, at once, fined twenty taels, withwhich to stand a treat. Besides, the stock of these articles is nowshort, and were you also to come, with ready money to this our mean shopto buy any, we wouldn't even have as much to give you. The best waytherefore is for you to go elsewhere. This is one side of the question;for on the other, you can't have anything above-board in view; and wereyou to obtain what you want as a loan you would again go and play thegiddy dog! But you'll simply say that on every occasion your uncle seesyou, he avails himself of it to find fault with you, but a young fellowlike you doesn't know what's good and what is bad; and you should,besides, make up your mind to earn a few cash, wherewith to clothe andfeed yourself, so that, when I see you, I too may rejoice!"
"What you, uncle, say," Chia Yun rejoined smiling, "is perfectly right;the only thing is that at the time of my father's death, I was likewiseso young in years that I couldn't understand anything; but later on, Iheard my mother explain how that for everything, it was lucky that you,after all, my uncles, went over to our house and devised the ways andmeans, and managed the funeral; and is it likely you, uncle, aren'taware of these things? Besides, have I forsooth had a single acre ofland or a couple of houses, the value of which I've run through as soonas it came into my hands? An ingenious wife cannot make boiled ricewithout raw rice; and what would you have me do? It's your good fortunehowever that you've got to deal with one such as I am, for had it beenany one else barefaced and shameless, he would have come, twice everythree days, to worry you, uncle, by asking for two pints of rice and twoof beans, and you then, uncle, would have had no help for it."
"My dear child," Pu Shih-jen exclaimed, "had I anything that I couldcall my own, your uncle as I am, wouldn't I feel bound to do somethingfor you? I've day after day mentioned to your aunt that the misfortunewas that you had no resources. But should you ever succeed in making upyour mind, you should go into that mighty household of yours, and whenthe gentlemen aren't looking, forthwith pocket your pride and hobnobwith those managers, or possibly with the butlers, as you may, eventhrough them, be able to get some charge or other! The other day, when Iwas out of town, I came across that old Quartus of the third branch ofthe family, astride of a tall donkey, at the head of four or fivecarriages, in which were about forty to fifty bonzes and Taoist priestson their way to the family fane, and that man can't lack brains, forsuch a charge to have fallen to his share!"
Chia Y�n, upon hearing these words, indulged in a long and revoltingrigmarole, and then got up to take his leave.
"What are you in such a hurry for?" Pu Shih-jen remarked. "Have yourmeal and then go!"
But this remark was scarcely ended when they heard his wife say: "Areyou again in the clouds? When I heard that there was no rice, I boughthalf a catty of dry rice paste, and brought it here for you to eat; anddo you pray now still put on the airs of a well-to-do, and keep yournephew to feel the pangs of hunger?"
"Well, then, buy half a catty more, and add to what there is, that'sall," Pu Shih-jen continued; whereupon her mother explained to herdaughter, Yin Chieh, "Go over to Mrs. Wang's opposite, and ask her ifshe has any cash, to lend us twenty or thirty of them; and to-morrow,when they're brought over, we'll repay her."
But while the husband and wife were carrying on this conversation, ChiaY�n had, at an early period, repeated several times: "There's no need togo to this trouble," and off he went, leaving no trace or shadow behind.But without passing any further remarks on the husband and wife of thePu family, we will now confine ourselves to Chia Y�n. Having gone inhigh dudgeon out of the door of his uncle's house, he started straighton his way back home; but while distressed in mind, and preoccupied withhis thoughts, he paced on with drooping head, he unexpectedly came intocollision with a drunken fellow, who gripped Chia Y�n, and began toabuse him, crying: "Are your eyes gone blind, that you come bang againstme?"
The tone of voice, when it reached Chia Y�n ears, sounded like that ofsome one with whom he was intimate; and, on careful scrutiny, he found,in fact, that it was his next-door neighbour, Ni Erh. This Ni Erh was adissolute knave, whose only idea was to give out money at heavy rates ofinterest and to have his meals in the gambling dens. His sole delightwas to drink and to fight.
He was, at this very moment, coming back home from the house of acreditor, whom he had dunned, and was already far gone with drink, sothat when, at an unforeseen moment, Chia Y�n ran against him, he meantthere and then to start a scuffle with him.
"Old Erh!" Chia Y�n shouted, "stay your hand; it's I who have hustledagainst you."
As soon as Ni Erh heard the tone of his voice, he opened wide hisdrunken eyes and gave him a look; and realising that it was Chia Y�n, hehastened to loosen his grasp and to remark with a smile, as he staggeredabout, "Is it you indeed, master Chia Secundus? where were you off tonow?"
"I couldn't tell you!" Chia Y�n rejoined; "I've again broughtdispleasure upon me, and all through no fault of mine."
"Never mind!" urged Ni Erh, "if you're in any trouble you just tell me,and I'll give vent to your spite for you; for in these three streets,and six lanes, no matter who may give offence to any neighbours of mine,of me, Ni Erh, the drunken Chin Kang, I'll wager that I compel thatman's family to disperse, and his home to break up!"
"Old Ni, don't lose your temper," Chia Y�n protested, "but listen andlet me tell you what happened!" After which, he went on to tell Ni Erhthe whole affair with Pu Shih-jen. As soon as Ni Erh heard him, he gotinto a frightful rage; "Were he not," he shouted, a "relative of yours,master Secundus, I would readily give him a bit of my mind! Reallyresentment will stifle my breath! but never mind! you needn't howeverdistress yourself. I've got here a few taels ready at hand, which, ifyou require, don't scruple to take; and from such good neighbours as youare, I won't ask any interest upon this money."
With this remark still on his lips, he produced from his pouch a bundleof silver.
"Ni Erh has, it is true, ever been a rogue," Chia Y�n reflected in hisown mind, "but as he is regulated in his dealings by a due regard topersons, he enjoys, to a great degree, the reputation of generosity; andwere I to-day not to accept this favour of his, he'll, I fear, be put toshame; and it won't contrariwise be nice on my part! and isn't it betterthat I should make use of his money, and by and by I can repay himdouble, and things will be all right!"
"Old Erh," he therefore observed aloud with a smile, "you're really afine fellow, and as you've shown me such eminent consideration, how canI presume not to accept your offer! On my return home, I'll write thecustomary I.O.U., and send it to you, and all will be in order."
Ni Erh gave a broad grin. "It's only fifteen taels and three mace," heanswered, "and if you insist upon writing an I.O.U., I won't then lendit to you!"
Chia Y�n at these words, took over the money, smiling the while. "I'llreadily," he retorted, "comply with your wishes and have done; forwhat's the use of exasperating you!"
"Well then that will be all right!" Ni Erh laughed; "but the day isgetting dark; and I shan't ask you to have a cup of tea or stand you adrink, for I've some small things more to settle. As for me, I'm goingover there, but you, after all, should please wend your way homewards;and I shall also request you to take a message for me to my people. Tellthem to close the doors and turn in, as I'm not returning home; and thatin the event of anything occurring, to bid our daughter come overto-morrow, as soon as it is daylight, to short-legged Wang's house, thehorse-dealer's, in search of me!" And as he uttered this remark hewalked away, stumbling and hobbling along. But we will leave him withoutfurther notice and allude to Chia Y�n.
He had, at quite an unexpected juncture, met this piece of luck, so thathis heart was, of course, delighted to the utmost degree. "This Ni Erh,"he mused, "is really a good enough sort of fellow, but what I dread isthat he may have been open-handed in his fit of drunkenness, and that hemayn't, by and by, ask for his money to be paid twice over; and whatwill I do then? Never mind," he suddenly went on to ponder, "when thatjob has become an accomplished fact, I shall even have the means to payhim back double the original amount."
Prompted by this resolution, he came over to a money-shop, and when hehad the silver weighed, and no discrepancy was discovered in the weight,he was still more elated at heart; and on his way back, he first andforemost delivered Ni Erh's message to his wife, and then returned tohis own home, where he found his mother seated all alone on astove-couch spinning thread. As soon as she saw him enter, she inquiredwhere he had been the whole day long, in reply to which Chia Y�n,fearing lest his parent should be angry, forthwith made no allusion towhat transpired with Pu Shih-jen, but simply explained that he had beenin the western mansion, waiting for his uncle Secundus, Lien. This over,he asked his mother whether she had had her meal or not, and his parentsaid by way of reply: "I've had it, but I've kept something for you inthere," and calling to the servant-maid, she bade her bring it round,and set it before him to eat. But as it was already dark, when the lampshad to be lit, Chia Y�n, after partaking of his meal, got ready andturned in.
Nothing of any notice transpired the whole night; but the next day, assoon it was dawn, he got up, washed his face, and came to the mainstreet, outside the south gate, and purchasing some musk from aperfumery shop, he, with rapid stride, entered the Jung Kuo mansion; andhaving, as a result of his inquiries, found out that Chia Lien had goneout of doors, Chia Y�n readily betook himself to the back, in front ofthe door of Chia Lien's court, where he saw several servant-lads, withimmense brooms in their hands, engaged in that place in sweeping thecourt. But as he suddenly caught sight of Chou Jui's wife appear outsidethe door, and call out to the young boys; "Don't sweep now, our lady iscoming out," Chia Y�n eagerly walked up to her and inquired, with a facebeaming with smiles: "Where's aunt Secunda going to?"
To this inquiry, Chou Jui's wife explained: "Our old lady has sent forher, and I expect, it must be for her to cut some piece of cloth orother." But while she yet spoke, they perceived a whole bevy of people,pressing round lady Feng, as she egressed from the apartment.
Chia Y�n was perfectly aware that lady Feng took pleasure in flattery,and delighted in display, so that hastily dropping his arms, he with allreverence, thrust himself forward and paid his respects to her. But ladyFeng did not even so much as turn to look at him with straight eyes; butcontinued, as hitherto, her way onwards, simply confining herself toascertaining whether his mother was all right, and adding: "How is itthat she doesn't come to our house for a stroll?"
"The thing is," Chia Y�n replied, "that she's not well: she, however,often thinks fondly of you, aunt, and longs to see you; but as forcoming round, she's quite unable to do so."
"You have, indeed, the knack of telling lies!" lady Feng laughed withirony; "for hadn't I alluded to her, she would never have thought ofme!"
"Isn't your nephew afraid," Chia Y�n protested smilingly, "of beingblasted by lightning to have the audacity of telling lies in thepresence of an elder! Even so late as yesterday evening, she alluded toyou, aunt! 'Though naturally,' she said, 'of a weak constitution, youhad, however, plenty to attend to! that it's thanks to your supremelyeminent energies, aunt, that you're, after all, able to manageeverything in such a perfect manner; and that had you ever made theslightest slip, there would have long ago crept up, goodness knows, whattroubles!'"
As soon as lady Feng heard these words, her whole face beamed withsmiles, and she unconsciously halted her steps, while she proceeded toask: "How is it that, both your mother and yourself, tattle about mebehind my back, without rhyme or reason?"
"There's a reason for it," Chia Y�n observed, "which is simply this.I've an excellent friend with considerable money of his own at home, whorecently kept a perfumery shop; but as he obtained, by purchase, therank of deputy sub-prefect, he was, the other day, selected for a postin Yunnan, in some prefecture or other unknown to me; whither he hasgone together with his family. He even closed this shop of his, andforthwith collecting all his wares, he gave away, what he could giveaway, and what he had to sell at a discount, was sold at a loss; whilesuch valuable articles, as these, were all presented to relatives orfriends; and that's why it is that I came in for some baroos camphor andmusk. But I at the time, deliberated with my mother that to sell thembelow their price would be a pity, and that if we wished to give them asa present to any one, there was no one good enough to use such perfumes.But remembering how you, aunt, had all along in years gone by, even tothis day, to spend large bundles of silver, in purchasing such articles,and how, not to speak of this year with an imperial consort in thePalace, what's even required for this dragon boat festival, will alsonecessitate the addition of hundred times as much as the quantity ofprevious years, I therefore present them to you, aunt, as a token of myesteem!"
With these words still on his lips, he simultaneously produced anornamented box, which he handed over to her. And as lady Feng was, atthis time, making preparations for presents for the occasion of thedragon boat festival, for which perfumes were obligatory, she, with allpromptitude, directed Feng Erh: "Receive Mr. Y�n's present and take ithome and hand it over to P'ing Erh. To one," she consequently added,"who seems to me so full of discrimination, it isn't a wonder that youruncle is repeatedly alluding, and that he speaks highly of you; how thatyou talk with all intelligence and that you have experience stored up inyour mind."
Chia Y�n upon hearing this propitious language, hastily drew near onestep, and designedly asked: "Does really uncle often refer to me?"
The moment lady Feng caught this question, she was at once inclined totell him all about the charge to be entrusted to him, but on secondthought, she again felt apprehensive lest she should be looked lightlyupon by him, by simply insinuating that she had promptly and needlesslypromised him something to do, so soon as she got a little scented ware;and this consideration urged her to once more restrain her tongue, sothat she never made the slightest reference even to so much as one wordabout his having been chosen to look after the works of planting theflowers and trees. And after confining herself to making the first fewirrelevant remarks which came to her lips, she hastily betook herselfinto dowager lady Chia's apartments.
Chia Y�n himself did not feel as if he could very well advert to thesubject, with the result that he had no alternative but to retrace hissteps homewards. But as when he had seen Pao-y� the previous day, he hadasked him to go into the outer library and wait for him, he thereforefinished his meal and then once again entered the mansion and came overinto the I Hsia study, situated outside the ceremonial gate, over at oldlady Chia's part of the compound, where he discovered the two lads MingYen, whose name had been changed into Pei Ming, and Chu Yo playing atchess, and just arguing about the capture of a castle; and besides them,Yin Ch'uan, Sao Hua, T'iao Y�n, Pan Ho, these four or five of them, upto larks, stealing the young birds from the nests under the eaves of thehouse.
As soon as Chia Y�n entered the court, he stamped his foot and shouted,"The monkeys are up to mischief! Here I am, I've come;" and when thecompany of servant-boys perceived him, they one and all promptlydispersed; while Chia Y�n walked into the library, and seating himselfat once in a chair, he inquired, "Has your master Secundus, Mr. Pao,come down?"
"He hasn't been down here at all to-day," Pei Ming replied, "but if you,Mr. Secundus, have anything to tell him, I'll go and see what he's up tofor you."
Saying this he there and then left the room; and Chia Y�n meanwhile gavehimself to the inspection of the pictures and nicknacks. But someconsiderable time elapsed, and yet he did not see him arrive; andnoticing besides that the other lads had all gone to romp, he was justplunged in a state of despondency, when he heard outside the door avoice cry out, with winning tone, and tender accents: "My elderbrother!"
Chia Y�n looked out, and saw that it was a servant-maid of fifteen orsixteen, who was indeed extremely winsome and spruce. As soon however asthe maid caught a glimpse of Chia Y�n, she speedily turned herself roundand withdrew out of sight. But, as luck would have it, it happened thatPei Ming was coming along, and seeing the servant-maid in front of thedoor, he observed: "Welcome, welcome! I was quite at a loss how to getany news of Pao-y�." And as Chia Y�n discerned Pei Ming, he hastily too,ran out in pursuit of him, and ascertained what was up; whereupon PeiMing returned for answer: "I waited a whole day long, and not a singlesoul came over; but this girl is attached to master Secundus' (Mr.Pao's) rooms!" and, "My dear girl," he consequently went on to say, "goin and take a message. Say that Mr. Secundus, who lives under theportico, has come!"
The servant-maid, upon hearing these words, knew at once that he was ayoung gentleman belonging to the family in which she served, and she didnot skulk out of sight, as she had done in the first instance; but witha gaze sufficient to kill, she fixed her two eyes upon Chia Y�n, whenshe heard Chia Y�n interpose: "What about over the portico and under theportico; you just tell him that Y�n Erh is come, that's all."
After a while this girl gave a sarcastic smile. "My idea is," sheventured, "that you, master Secundus, should really, if it so pleaseyou, go back, and come again to-morrow; and to-night, if I find time,I'll just put in a word with him!"
"What's this that you're driving at?" Pei Ming then shouted.
And the maid rejoined: "He's not even had a siesta to-day, so that he'llhave his dinner at an early hour, and won't come down again in theevening; and is it likely that you would have master Secundus wait hereand suffer hunger? and isn't it better than he should return home? Theright thing is that he should come to-morrow; for were even by and bysome one to turn up, who could take a message, that person would simplyacquiesce with the lips, but would he be willing to deliver the messagein for you?"
Chia Y�n, upon finding how concise and yet how well expressed thisgirl's remarks had been, was bent upon inquiring what her name was; butas she was a maid employed in Pao-y�'s apartments, he did not thereforefeel justified in asking the question, and he had no other course but toadd, "What you say is quite right, I'll come to-morrow!" and as hespoke, he there and then was making his way outside, when Pei Mingremarked: "I'll go and pour a cup of tea; and master Secundus, have yourtea and then go."
Chia Y�n turned his head round, as he kept on his way, and said by wayof rejoinder: "I won't have any tea; for I've besides something more toattend to!" and while with his lips he uttered these words, he, with hiseyes, stared at the servant-girl, who was still standing in there.
Chia Y�n wended his steps straightway home; and the next day, he came tothe front entrance, where, by a strange coincidence, he met lady Feng onher way to the opposite side to pay her respects. She had just mountedher carriage, but perceiving Chia Y�n arrive, she eagerly bade a servantstop him, and, with the window between them, she smiled and observed:"Y�n Erh, you're indeed bold in playing your pranks with me! I thoughtit strange that you should give me presents; but the fact is you had afavour to ask of me; and your uncle told me even yesterday that you hadappealed to him!"
Chia Y�n smiled. "Of my appeal to uncle, you needn't, aunt, make anymention; for I'm at this moment full of regret at having made it. Had Iknown, at an early hour, that things would have come to this pass, Iwould, from the very first, have made my request to you, aunt; and bythis time everything would have been settled long ago! But who wouldhave anticipated that uncle was, after all, a man of no worth!"
"Strange enough," lady Feng remarked sneeringly, "when you found thatyou didn't succeed in that quarter, you came again yesterday in searchof me!"
"Aunt, you do my filial heart an injustice," Chia Y�n protested; "Inever had such a thought; had I entertained any such idea, wouldn't I,aunt, have made my appeal to you yesterday? But as you are now aware ofeverything, I'll really put uncle on one side, and prefer my request toyou; for circumstances compel me to entreat you, aunt, to be so good asto show me some little consideration!"
Lady Feng laughed sardonically. "You people will choose the long road tofollow and put me also in a dilemma! Had you told me just one word at anearly hour, what couldn't have been brought about? an affair of stateindeed to be delayed up to this moment! In the garden, there are to bemore trees planted and flowers laid down, and I couldn't think of anyperson that I could have recommended, and had you spoken before this,wouldn't the whole question have been settled soon enough?"
"Well, in that case, aunt," ventured Chia Y�n with a smile, "you hadbetter depute me to-morrow, and have done!"
"This job," continued lady Feng after a pause, "is not, my impressionis, very profitable; and if you were to wait till the first moon of nextyear, when the fireworks, lanterns, and candles will have to bepurveyed, I'll depute you as soon as those extensive commissions turnup."
"My dear aunt," pleaded Chia Y�n, "first appoint me to this one, and ifI do really manage this satisfactorily, you can then commission me withthat other!"
"You know in truth how to draw a long thread," lady Feng observedlaughing. "But hadn't it been that your uncle had spoken to me on youraccount, I wouldn't have concerned myself about you. But as I shallcross over here soon after the repast, you had better come at elevena.m., and fetch the money, for you to enter into the garden the dayafter to-morrow, and have the flowers planted!"
As she said this, she gave orders to drive the "scented" carriage, andwent on her way by the quickest cut; while Chia Y�n, who wasirrepressibly delighted, betook himself into the I Hsia study, andinquired after Pao-y�. But, who would have thought it, Pao-y� had, at anearly hour, gone to the mansion of the Prince of Pei Ching, so that ChiaY�n had to sit in a listless mood till noon; and when he found out thatlady Feng had returned, he speedily wrote an acknowledgment and came toreceive the warrant. On his arrival outside the court, he commissioned aservant to announce him, and Ts'ai Ming thereupon walked out, and merelyasking for the receipt, went in, and, after filling in the amount, theyear and moon, he handed it over to Chia Y�n together with the warrant.Chia Y�n received them from him, and as the entry consisted of twohundred taels, his heart was full of exultant joy; and turning round, hehurried to the treasury, where after he had taken over the amount insilver, he returned home and laid the case before his mother, andneedless to say, that both the parent and her son were in high spirits.The next day, at the fifth watch, Chia Yun first came in search of NiErh, to whom he repaid the money, and then taking fifty taels along withhim, he sped outside the western gate to the house of Fang Ch'un, agardener, to purchase trees, where we will leave him without sayinganything more about him.
We will now resume our story with Pao-y�. The day on which heencountered Chia Y�n, he asked him to come in on the morrow and have achat with him, but this invitation was practically the mere formal talkof a rich and well-to-do young man, and was not likely to be so much asborne in mind; and so it was that it readily slipped from his memory. Onthe evening of the day, however, on which he returned home from themansion of the Prince Pei Ching, he came, after paying his salutationsto dowager lady Chia, madame Wang, and the other inmates, back into thegarden; but upon divesting himself of all his fineries, he was justabout to have his bath, when, as Hsi Jen had, at the invitation of Hs�ehPao-ch'ai, crossed over to tie a few knotted buttons, as Ch'in Wen andPi Hen had both gone to hurry the servants to bring the water, as T'anYun had likewise been taken home, on account of her mother's illness,and She Yueh, on the other hand, was at present ailing in her quarters,while the several waiting-maids, who were in there besides to attend tothe dirty work, and answer the calls, had, surmising that he would notrequisition their services, one and all gone out in search of theirfriends and in quest of their companions, it occurred, contrary to theircalculations, that Pao-y� remained this whole length of time quite alonein his apartments; and as it so happened that Pao-y� wanted tea todrink, he had to call two or three times before he at last saw three oldmatrons walk in. But at the sight of them, Pao-y� hastily waved his handand exclaimed: "No matter, no matter; I don't want you," whereupon thematrons had no help but to withdraw out of the rooms; and as Pao-y�perceived that there were no waiting-maids at hand, he had to come downand take a cup and go up to the teapot to pour the tea; when he heardsome one from behind him observe: "Master Secundus, beware, you'llscorch your hand; wait until I come to pour it!" And as she spoke, shewalked up to him, and took the cup from his grasp, to the intensesurprise, in fact, of Pao-y�, who inquired: "Where were you that youhave suddenly come to give me a start?"
The waiting-maid smiled as she handed him the tea. "I was in the backcourt," she replied, "and just came in from the back door of the innerrooms; and is it likely that you didn't, sir, hear the sound of myfootsteps?"
Pao-y� drank his tea, and as he simultaneously passed the servant-girlunder a minute inspection, he found that though she wore severalarticles of clothing the worse for wear, she was, nevertheless, withthat head of beautiful hair, as black as the plumage of a raven, done upin curls, her face so oblong, her figure so slim and elegant, indeed,supremely beautiful, sweet, and spruce, and Pao-y� eagerly inquired:"Are you also a girl attached to this room of mine?"
"I am," rejoined that waiting-maid.
"But since you belong to this room, how is it I don't know you?" Pao-y�added.
When the maid heard these words, she forced a laugh. "There are evenmany," she explained, "that are strangers to you; and is it only myself?I've never, before this, served tea, or handed water, or brought inanything; nor have I attended to a single duty in your presence, so howcould you know me?"
"But why don't you attend to any of those duties that would bring you tomy notice?" Pao-y� questioned.
"I too," answered the maid, "find it as difficult to answer such aquestion. There's however one thing that I must report to you, masterSecundus. Yesterday, some Mr. Y�n Erh or other came to see you; but as Ithought you, sir, had no leisure, I speedily bade Pei Ming tell him tocome early to-day. But you unexpectedly went over again to the mansionof the Prince of Pei Ching."
When she had spoken as far as this, she caught sight of Ch'iu Wen and PiHen enter the court, giggling and laughing; the two of them carryingbetween them a bucket of water; and while raising their skirts with onehand, they hobbled along, as the water spurted and plashed. Thewaiting-maid hastily come out to meet them so as to relieve them oftheir burden, but Ch'iu Wen and Pi Hen were in the act of standing faceto face and finding fault with each other; one saying, "You've wetted myclothes," the other adding, "You've trod on my shoes," and upon, all ofa sudden, espying some one walk out to receive the water, anddiscovering, when they came to see, that it was actually no one elsethan Hsiao Hung, they were at once both so taken aback that, puttingdown the bucket, they hurried into the room; and when they looked aboutand saw that there was no other person inside besides Pao-y� they wereat once displeased. But as they were meanwhile compelled to get readythe articles necessary for his bath, they waited until Pao-y� was aboutto divest himself of his clothes, when the couple of them speedilypulled the door to behind them, as they went out, and walked as far asthe room on the opposite side, in search of Hsiao Hung; of whom theyinquired: "What were you doing in his room a short while back?"
"When was I ever in the room?" Hsiao Hung replied; "simply because Ilost sight of my handkerchief, I went to the back to try and find it,when unexpectedly Mr. Secundus, who wanted tea, called for you sisters;and as there wasn't one even of you there, I walked in and poured a cupfor him, and just at that very moment you sisters came back."
"You barefaced, low-bred thing!" cried Ch'iu Wen, turning towards herand spurting in her face. "It was our bounden duty to tell you to go andhurry them for the water, but you simply maintained that you were busyand made us go instead, in order to afford you an opportunity ofperforming these wily tricks! and isn't this raising yourself up li byli? But don't we forsooth, even so much as come up to you? and you justtake that looking-glass and see for yourself, whether you be fit toserve tea and to hand water or not?"
"To-morrow," continued Pi Hea, "I'll tell them that whenever there'sanything to do connected with his wanting tea, or asking for water, orwith fetching things for him, not one of us should budge, and that_she_ alone should be allowed to go, and have done!"
"If this be your suggestion," remarked Ch'iu Wen, "wouldn't it be stillbetter that we should all disperse, and let her reign supreme in thisroom!"
But while the two of them were up to this trouble, one saying one thing,and another, another, they caught sight of two old nurses walk in todeliver a message from lady Feng; who explained: "To-morrow, someonewill bring in gardeners to plant trees, and she bids you keep under morerigorous restraint, and not sun your clothes and petticoats anywhere andeverywhere; nor air them about heedlessly; that the artificial hillwill, all along, be entirely shut in by screening curtains, and that youmustn't he running about at random."
"I wonder," interposed Ch'iu Wen with alacrity, "who it is that willbring the workmen to-morrow, and supervise the works?"
"Some one or other called Mr. Y�n, living at the back portico," the oldwoman observed.
But Ch'iu Wen and Pi Hen were neither of them acquainted with him, andthey went on promiscuously asking further questions on his account, butHsiao Hung knew distinctly in her mind who it was, and was well awarethat it was the person whom she had seen, the previous day, in the outerlibrary.
The surname of this Hsiao Hung had, in fact, been originally Lin, whileher infant name had been Hung Y�; but as the word Y� improperlycorresponded with the names of Pao-y� and Tai-y�, she was, in duecourse, simply called Hsiao Hung. She was indeed an hereditary servantof the mansion; and her father had latterly taken over the charge of allmatters connected with the farms and farmhouses in every locality. ThisHung-y� came, at the age of sixteen, into the mansion, to enter intoservice, and was attached to the Hung Yuan, where in point of fact shefound both a quiet and pleasant home; and when contrary to allexpectation, the young ladies as well as Pao-y�, were subsequentlypermitted to move their quarters into the garden of Broad Vista, it sohappened that this place was, moreover, fixed upon by Pao-y�. This HsiaoHung was, it is true, a girl without any experience, but as she could,to a certain degree, boast of a pretty face, and as, in her own heart,she recklessly fostered the idea of exalting herself to a higherstandard, she was ever ready to thrust herself in Pao-y�'s way, with aview to showing herself off. But attached to Pao-y�'s personal servicewere a lot of servants, all of whom were glib and specious, so that howcould she ever find an opportunity of thrusting herself forward? Butcontrary to her anticipations, there turned up, eventually on this day,some faint glimmer of hope, but as she again came in for a spell ofspiteful abuse from Ch'iu Wen and her companion, her expectations weresoon considerably frustrated, and she was just plunged in a melancholymood, when suddenly she heard the old nurse begin the conversation aboutChia Y�n, which unconsciously so affected her heart that she hastilyreturned, quite disconsolate, into her room, and lay herself down on herbed, giving herself quietly to reflection. But while she was racking andtorturing her brain and at a moment when she was at a loss what decisionto grasp, her ear unexpectedly caught, emanating from outside thewindow, a faint voice say: "Hsiao Hung, I've picked up your pockethandkerchief in here!" and as soon as Hsiao Hung heard these words, shewalked out with hurried step and found that it was no one else than ChiaY�n in person; and as Hsiao Hung unwillingly felt her powdered facesuffused with brushes: "Where did you pick it up, Mr. Secundus?" sheasked.
"Come over," Chia Y�n smiled, "and I'll tell you!" And as he utteredthese words, he came up and drew her to him; but Hsiao Hung twistedherself round and ran away; but was however tripped over by the step ofthe door.
Now, reader, do you want to know the sequel? If so the next chapter willexplain.

CHAPTER XXV.
  By a demoniacal art, a junior uncle and an elder brother's wife      (Pao-yue and lady Feng) come across five devils.  The gem of Spiritual Perception meets, in a fit of torpor, the two      perfect men.
Hsiao Hung, the story continues, was much unsettled in her mind. Herthoughts rolled on in one connected string. But suddenly she becamedrowsy, and falling asleep, she encountered Chia Yuen, who tried to carryout his intention to drag her near him. She twisted herself round, andendeavoured to run away; but was tripped over by the doorstep. This gaveher such a start that she woke up. Then, at length, she realised that itwas only a dream. But so restlessly did she, in consequence of thisfright, keep on rolling and tossing that she could not close her eyesduring the whole night. As soon as the light of the next day dawned, shegot up. Several waiting-maids came at once to tell her to go and sweepthe floor of the rooms, and to bring water to wash the face with. HsiaoHung did not even wait to arrange her hair or perform her ablutions;but, turning towards the looking-glass, she pinned her chevelure upanyhow; and, rinsing her hands, and, tying a sash round her waist, sherepaired directly to sweep the apartments.
Who would have thought it, Pao-yue also had set his heart upon her themoment he caught sight of her the previous day. Yet he feared, in thefirst place, that if he mentioned her by name and called her over intohis service, Hsi Jen and the other girls might feel the pangs ofjealousy. He did not, either in the second place, have any idea what herdisposition was like. The consequence was that he felt downcast; so muchso, that when he got up at an early hour, he did not even comb his hairor wash, but simply remained seated, and brooded in a state ofabstraction. After a while, he lowered the window. Through the gauzeframe, from which he could distinctly discern what was going on outside,he espied several servant-girls, engaged in sweeping the court. All ofthem were rouged and powdered; they had flowers inserted in their hair,and were grandly got up. But the only one, of whom he failed to get aglimpse, was the girl he had met the day before.
Pao-yue speedily walked out of the door with slipshod shoes. Under thepretence of admiring the flowers, he glanced, now towards the east; nowtowards the west. But upon raising his head, he descried, in thesouthwest corner, some one or other leaning by the side of the railingunder the covered passage. A crab-apple tree, however, obstructed theview and he could not see distinctly who it was, so advancing a stepfurther in, he stared with intent gaze. It was, in point of fact, thewaiting-maid of the day before, tarrying about plunged in a reverie. Hiswish was to go forward and meet her, but he did not, on the other hand,see how he could very well do so. Just as he was cogitating withinhimself, he, of a sudden, perceived Pi Hen come and ask him to go andwash his face. This reminder placed him under the necessity of betakinghimself into his room. But we will leave him there, without furtherdetails, so as to return to Hsiao Hung.
She was communing with her own thoughts. But unawares perceiving Hsi Jenwave her hand and call her by name, she had to walk up to her.
"Our watering-pot is spoilt," Hsi Jen smiled and said, "so go to MissLin's over there and find one for us to use."
Hsiao Hung hastened on her way towards the Hsiao Hsiang Kuan.
When she got as far as the Ts'ui Yen bridge, she saw, on raising herhead and looking round, the mounds and lofty places entirely shut in byscreens, and she bethought herself that labourers were that day to planttrees in that particular locality.
At a great distance off, a band of men were, in very deed, engaged indigging up the soil, while Chia Yuen was seated on a boulder on the hill,superintending the works. The time came for Hsiao Hung to pass by, butshe could not muster the courage to do so. Nevertheless she had no othercourse than to quietly proceed to the Hsiao Hsiang Kuan. Then gettingthe watering-pot, she sped on her way back again. But being in lowspirits, she retired alone into her room and lay herself down. One andall, however, simply maintained that she was out of sorts, so they didnot pay any heed to her.
A day went by. On the morrow fell, in fact, the anniversary of the birthof Wang Tzu-t'eng's spouse, and some one was despatched from hisresidence to come and invite dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang. MadameWang found out however that dowager lady Chia would not avail herself ofthe invitation, and neither would she go. So Mrs. Hsueeh went along withlady Feng, and the three sisters of the Chia family, and Pao-ch'ai andPao-yue, and only returned home late in the evening.
Madame Wang was sitting in Mrs. Hsueeh's apartments, whither she had justcrossed, when she perceived Chia Huan come back from school, and shebade him transcribe incantations out of the Chin Kang Canon and intonatethem. Chia Huan accordingly came and seated himself on the stove-couch,occupied by Madame Wang, and, directing a servant to light the candles,he started copying in an ostentatious and dashing manner. Now he calledTs'ai Hsia to pour a cup of tea for him. Now he asked Yu Ch'uan to takethe scissors and cut the snuff of the wick. "Chin Ch'uan!" he nextcried, "you're in the way of the rays of the lamp."
The servant-girls had all along entertained an antipathy for him, andnot one of them therefore worried her mind about what he said. Ts'aiHsia was the only one who still got on well with him, so pouring a cupof tea, she handed it to him. But she felt prompted to whisper to him:"Keep quiet a bit! what's the use of making people dislike you?"
"I know myself how matters stand," Chia Huan rejoined, as he cast asteady glance at her; "so don't you try and befool me! Now that you areon intimate terms with Pao-yue, you don't pay much heed to me. I've alsoseen through it myself."
Ts'ai Hsiao set her teeth together, and gave him a fillip on the head."You heartless fellow!" she cried. "You're like the dog, that bit LueT'ung-pin. You have no idea of what's right and what's wrong!"
While these two nagged away, they noticed lady Feng and Madame Wangcross together over to them. Madame Wang at once assailed him withquestions. She asked him how many ladies had been present on that day,whether the play had been good or bad, and what the banquet had beenlike.
But a brief interval over, Pao-yue too appeared on the scene. Aftersaluting Madame Wang, he also made a few remarks, with all decorum; andthen bidding a servant remove his frontlet, divest him of his long gownand pull off his boots, he rushed head foremost, into his mother's lap.
Madame Wang caressed and patted him. But while Pao-yue clung to hismother's neck, he spoke to her of one thing and then another.
"My child," said Madame Wang, "you've again had too much to drink; yourface is scalding hot, and if you still keep on rubbing and scraping it,why, you'll by and bye stir up the fumes of wine! Don't you yet go andlie down quietly over there for a little!"
Chiding him the while, she directed a servant to fetch a pillow. Pao-yuetherefore lay himself down at the back of Madame Wang, and called Ts'aiHsia to come and stroke him.
Pao-yue then began to bandy words with Ts'ai Hsia. But perceiving thatTs'ai Hsia was reserved, and, that instead of paying him any attention,she kept her eyes fixed upon Chia Huan, Pao-yue eagerly took her hand."My dear girl!" he said; "do also heed me a little;" and as he gaveutterance to this appeal, he kept her hand clasped in his.
Ts'ai Hsia, however, drew her hand away and would not let him hold it."If you go on in this way," she vehemently exclaimed, "I'll shout out atonce."
These two were in the act of wrangling, when verily Chia Huan overheardwhat was going on. He had, in fact, all along hated Pao-yue; so when onthis occasion, he espied him up to his larks with Ts'ai Hsia, he couldmuch less than ever stifle feelings of resentment in his heart. Aftersome reflection, therefore, an idea suggested itself to his mind, andpretending that it was by a slip of the hand, he shoved the candle,overflowing with tallow, into Pao-yue's face.
"Ai ya!" Pao-yue was heard to exclaim. Every one in the whole room wasplunged in consternation. With precipitate haste, the lanterns, standingon the floor, were moved over; and, with the first ray of light, theydiscovered that Pao-yue's face was one mass of tallow.
Madame Wang gave way to anger as well as anxiety. At one time, sheissued directions to the servants to rub and wash Pao-yue clean. Atanother, she heaped abuse upon Chia Huan.
Lady Feng jumped on to the stone-couch by leaps and bounds. But whileintent upon removing the stuff from Pao-yue's face, she simultaneouslyejaculated: "Master Tertius, are you still such a trickster! I'll tellyou what, you'll never turn to any good account! Yet dame Chao shouldever correct and admonish him."
This single remark suggested the idea to Madame Wang, and she lost notime in sending for Mrs. Chao to come round.
"You bring up," she berated her, "such a black-hearted offspring likethis, and don't you, after all, advise and reprove him? Time and again Ipaid no notice whatever to what happened, and you and he have becomemore audacious, and have gone from worse to worse!"
Mrs. Chao had no alternative but to suppress every sense of injury,silence all grumblings, and go herself and lend a hand to the others intidying Pao-yue. She then perceived that a whole row of blisters hadrisen on the left side of Pao-yue's face, but that fortunately no injuryhad been done to his eyes.
When Madame Wang's attention was drawn to them she felt her heart sore.It fell a prey to fears also lest when dowager lady Chia made anyinquiries about them she should find it difficult to give her anysatisfactory reply. And so distressed did she get that she gave Mrs.Chao another scolding. But while she tried to comfort Pao-yue, she, atthe same time, fetched some powder for counteracting the effects of thevirus, and applied it on his face.
"It's rather sore," said Pao-yue, "but it's nothing to speak of. Tomorrowwhen my old grandmother asks about it, I can simply explain that Iscalded it myself; that will be quite enough to tell her."
"If you say that you scalded it yourself," lady Feng observed, "why,she'll also call people to task for not looking out; and a fit of ragewill, beyond doubt, be the outcome of it all."
Madame Wang then ordered the servants to take care and escort Pao-yueback to his room. On their arrival, Hsi Jen and his other attendants sawhim, and they were all in a great state of flurry.
As for Lin Tai-yue, when she found that Pao-yue had gone out of doors, shecontinued the whole day a prey to ennui. In the evening, she deputedmessengers two and three times to go and inquire about him. But when shecame to know that he had been scalded, she hurried in person to come andsee him. She then discovered Pao-yue all alone, holding a glass andscanning his features in it; while the left side of his face wasplastered all over with some medicine.
Lin Tai-yue imagined that the burn was of an extremely serious nature,and she hastened to approach him with a view to examine it. Pao-yue,however, screened his face, and, waving his hand, bade her leave theroom; for knowing her usual knack for tidiness he did not feel inclinedto let her get a glimpse of his face. Tai-yue then gave up the attempt,and confined herself to asking him: "whether it was very painful?"
"It isn't very sore," replied Pao-yue, "if I look after it for a day ortwo, it will get all right."
But after another short stay, Lin Tai-yue repaired back to her quarters.
The next day Pao-yue saw dowager lady Chia. But in spite of hisconfession that he himself was responsible for the scalding of his face,his grandmother could not refrain from reading another lecture to theservants who had been in attendance.
A day after, Ma, a Taoist matron, whose name was recorded as Pao-yue'sgodmother, came on a visit to the mansion. Upon perceiving Pao-yue, shewas very much taken aback, and asked all about the circumstances of theaccident. When he explained that he had been scalded, she forthwithshook her head and heaved a sigh; then while making with her fingers afew passes over Pao-yue's face, she went on to mutter incantations forseveral minutes. "I can guarantee that he'll get all right," she added,"for this is simply a sadden and fleeting accident!"
Turning towards dowager lady Chia: "Venerable ancestor," she observed,"Venerable Buddha! how could you ever be aware of the existence of theportentous passage in that Buddhistic classic, 'to the effect that a sonof every person, who holds the dignity of prince, duke or highfunctionary, has no sooner come into the world and reached a certain agethan numerous evil spirits at once secretly haunt him, and pinch him,when they find an opportunity; or dig their nails into him; or knock hisbowl of rice down, during, meal-time; or give him a shove and send himover, while he is quietly seated.' So this is the reason why themajority of the sons and grandsons of those distinguished families donot grow up to attain manhood."
Dowager lady Chia, upon hearing her speak in this wise, eagerly asked:"Is there any Buddhistic spell, by means of which to check theirinfluence or not?"
"This is an easy job!" rejoined the Taoist matron Ma, "all one need dois to perform several meritorious deeds on his account so as tocounteract the consequences of retribution and everything will then beput right. That canon further explains: 'that in the western part of theworld there is a mighty Buddha, whose glory illumines all things, andwhose special charge is to cast his lustre on the evil spirits in darkplaces; that if any benevolent man or virtuous woman offers himoblations with sincerity of heart, he is able to so successfullyperpetuate the peace and quiet of their sons and grandsons that thesewill no more meet with any calamities arising from being possessed bymalevolent demons.'"
"But what, I wonder," inquired dowager lady Chia, "could be offered tothis god?"
"Nothing of any great value," answered the Taoist matron, Ma. "Exclusiveof offerings of scented candles, several catties of scented oil can beadded, each day, to keep the lantern of the Great Sea alight. This'Great Sea' lantern is the visible embodiment and Buddhisticrepresentation of this divinity, so day and night we don't venture tolet it go out!"
"For a whole day and a whole night," asked dowager lady Chia, "how muchoil is needed, so that I too should accomplish a good action?"
"There is really no limit as to quantity. It rests upon the goodwill ofthe donor," Ma, the Taoist matron, put in by way of reply. "In myquarters, for instance, I have several lanterns, the gifts of theconsorts of princes and the spouses of high officials living in variouslocalities. The consort of the mansion of the Prince of Nan Au has beenprompted in her beneficence by a liberal spirit; she allows each dayforty-eight catties of oil, and a catty of wick; so that her 'Great Sea'lamp is only a trifle smaller than a water-jar. The spouse of themarquis of Chin Hsiang comes next, with no more than twenty catties aday. Besides these, there are several other families; some giving tencatties; some eight catties; some three; some five; subject to no fixedrule; and of course I feel bound to keep the lanterns alight on theirbehalf."
Dowager lady Chia nodded her head and gave way to reflection.
"There's still another thing," continued the Taoist matron, Ma. "If itbe on account of father or mother or seniors, any excessive donationwould not matter. But were you, venerable ancestor, to bestow too muchin your offering for Pao-yue, our young master won't, I fear, be equal tothe gift; and instead of being benefited, his happiness will be snapped.If you therefore want to make a liberal gift seven catties will do; if asmall one, then five catties will even be sufficient."
"Well, in that case," responded dowager lady Chia, "let us fix upon fivecatties a day, and every month come and receive payment of the wholelump sum!"
"O-mi-to-fu!" exclaimed Ma, the Taoist matron, "Oh merciful, and mightyP'u Sa!"
Dowager lady Chia then called the servants and impressed on their mindsthat whenever Pao-yue went out of doors in the future, they should giveseveral strings of cash to the pages to bestow on charity among thebonzes and Taoist priests, and the poor and needy they might meet on theway.
These directions concluded, the Taoist matron trudged into the variousquarters, and paid her respects, and then strolled leisurely about.Presently, she entered Mrs. Chao's apartments. After the two ladies hadexchanged salutations, Mrs. Chao bade a young servant-girl hand herguest a cup of tea. While Mrs. Chao busied herself pasting shoes, Ma,the Taoist matron, espied, piled up in a heap on the stove-couch, sundrypieces of silks and satins. "It just happens," she consequentlyremarked, "that I have no facings for shoes, so my lady do give me a fewodd cuttings of silk and satin, of no matter what colour, to make myselfa pair of shoes with."
Mrs. Chao heaved a sigh. "Look," she said, "whether there be still amongthem any pieces good for anything. But anything that's worth anythingdoesn't find its way in here. If you don't despise what's worthless,you're at liberty to select any two pieces and to take them away, andhave done."
The Taoist matron, Ma, chose with alacrity several pieces and shovedthem in her breast.
"The other day," Mrs. Chao went on to inquire, "I sent a servant overwith five hundred cash; have you presented any offerings before the godof medicine or not?"
"I've offered them long ago for you," the Taoist matron Ma rejoined.
"O-mi-to-fu!" ejaculated Mrs. Chao with a sigh, "were I a little betteroff, I'd also come often and offer gifts; but though my will beboundless, my means are insufficient!"
"Don't trouble your mind on this score," suggested Ma, the Taoistmatron. "By and bye, when Mr. Huan has grown up into a man and obtainedsome official post or other, will there be then any fear of your notbeing able to afford such offerings as you might like to make?"
At these words Mrs. Chao gave a smile. "Enough, enough!" she cried."Don't again refer to such contingencies! the present is a faircriterion. For up to whom in this house can my son and I come? Pao-yue isstill a mere child; but he is such that he wins people's love. Those bigpeople may be partial to him, and love him a good deal, I've nothing tosay to it; but I can't eat humble pie to this sort of mistress!"
While uttering this remark, she stretched out her two fingers.
Ma, the Taoist matron, understood the meaning she desired to convey."It's your lady Secunda, Lien, eh?" she forthwith asked.
Mrs. Chao was filled with trepidation. Hastily waving her hand, she gotto her feet, raised the portiere, and peeped outside. Perceiving thatthere was no one about, she at length retraced her footsteps."Dreadful!" she then said to the Taoist matron. "Dreadful! But speakingof this sort of mistress, I'm not so much as a human being, if shedoesn't manage to shift over into her mother's home the whole of thisfamily estate."
"Need you tell me this!" Ma, the Taoist matron, at these words, remarkedwith a view to ascertain what she implied. "Haven't I, forsooth,discovered it all for myself? Yet it's fortunate that you don't troubleyour minds about her; for it's far better that you should let her haveher own way."
"My dear woman," rejoined Mrs. Chao, "Not let her have her own way! why,is it likely that any one would have the courage to tell her anything?"
"I don't mean to utter any words that may bring upon me retribution,"added Ma, the Taoist matron, "but you people haven't got the wits. Butit's no matter of surprise. Yet if you daren't openly do anything, why,you could stealthily have devised some plan. And do you still tarry upto this day?"
Mrs. Chao realised that there lurked something in her insinuation, andshe felt an inward secret joy. "What plan could I stealthily devise?"she asked. "I've got the will right enough, but I'm not a person giftedwith this sort of gumption. So were you to impart to me some way orother, I would reward you most liberally."
When the Taoist matron, Ma, heard this, she drew near to her."O-mi-to-fu! desist at once from asking me!" she designedly exclaimed."How can I know anything about such matters, contrary as they are towhat is right?"
"There you are again!" Mrs. Chao replied. "You're one ever most ready tosuccour those in distress, and to help those in danger, and is it likelythat you'll quietly look on, while some one comes and compasses my deathas well as that of my son? Are you, pray, fearful lest I shouldn't giveyou any reward?"
Ma, the Taoist matron, greeted this remark with a smile. "You're rightenough in what you say," she ventured, "of my being unable to bear thesight of yourself and son receiving insult from a third party; but asfor your mention of rewards, why, what's there of yours that I stillcovet?"
This answer slightly reassured Mrs. Chao's mind. "How is it," shespeedily urged, "that an intelligent person like you should have becomeso dense? If, indeed, the spell prove efficacious, and we exterminatethem both, is there any apprehension that this family estate won't beours? and when that time comes, won't you get all you may wish?"
At this disclosure, Ma, the Taoist matron, lowered her head for a longtime. "When everything," she observed, "shall have been settledsatisfactorily, and when there'll be, what's more, no proof at all, willyou still pay any heed to me?"
"What's there hard about this?" remarked Mrs. Chao. "I've saved severaltaels from my own pin-money, and have besides a good number of clothesand head-ornaments. So you can first take several of these away withyou. And I'll further write an I.O.U., and entrust it to you, and whenthat time does come, I'll pay you in full."
"That will do!" answered the Taoist matron, Ma.
Mrs. Chao thereupon dismissed even a young servant-girl, who happened tobe in the room, and hastily opening a trunk, she produced severalarticles of clothing and jewelry, as well as a few odd pieces of silverfrom her own pocket-money. Then also writing a promissory note for fiftytaels, she surrendered the lot to Ma, the Taoist matron. "Take these,"she said, "in advance for presents in your temple."
At the sight of the various articles and of the promissory note, theTaoist matron became at once unmindful of what was right and what waswrong; and while her mouth was full of assent, she stretched out herarm, and first and foremost laid hold of the hard cash, and nextclutched the I.O.U. Turning then towards Mrs. Chao, she asked for asheet of paper; and taking up a pair of scissors, she cut out two humanbeings and gave them to Mrs. Chao, enjoining her to write on the upperpart of them the respective ages of the two persons in question. Lookingfurther for a sheet of blue paper, she cut out five blue-faced devils,which she bade her place together side by side with the paper men, andtaking a pin she made them fast. "When I get home," she remarked, "I'llhave recourse to some art, which will, beyond doubt, prove efficacious."
When she however had done speaking, she suddenly saw Madame Wang'swaiting-maid make her appearance inside the room. "What! my dame, areyou in here!" the girl exclaimed. "Why, our lady is waiting for you!"
The two dames then parted company.
But passing them over, we will now allude to Lin Tai-y mu. As Pao-yue hadscalded his face, and did not go out of doors very much, she often cameto have a chat with him. On this particular day she took up, after hermeal, some book or other and read a couple of pages out of it. Next, shebusied herself a little with needlework, in company with Tzu Chuan. Shefelt however thoroughly dejected and out of sorts. So she strolled outof doors along with her. But catching sight of the newly sprouted bambooshoots, in front of the pavilion, they involuntarily stepped out of theentrance of the court, and penetrated into the garden. They cast theireyes on all four quarters; but not a soul was visible. When they becameconscious of the splendour of the flowers and the chatter of the birds,they, with listless step, turned their course towards the I Hung court.There they found several servant-girls baling out water; while a bevy ofthem stood under the verandah, watching the thrushes having their bath.They heard also the sound of laughter in the rooms.
The fact is that Li Kung-ts'ai, lady Feng, and Pao-ch'ai were assembledinside. As soon as they saw them walk in, they with one voice shouted,smiling: "Now, are not these two more!"
"We are a full company to-day," laughed Tai-yue, "but who has issued thecards and invited us here?"
"The other day," interposed lady Feng, "I sent servants with a presentof two caddies of tea for you, Miss Lin; was it, after all, good?"
"I had just forgotten all about it," Tai-yue rejoined, "many thanks foryour kind attention!
"I tasted it," observed Pao-yue. "I did not think it anything good. But Idon't know how others, who've had any of it, find it."
"Its flavour," said Tai-yue, "is good; the only thing is, it has nocolour."
"It's tribute tea from the Laos Kingdom," continued lady Feng. "When Itried it, I didn't either find it anything very fine. It's not up towhat we ordinarily drink."
"To my taste, it's all right," put in Tai-yue. "But what your palates arelike, I can't make out."
"As you say it's good," suggested Pao-yue, "you're quite at liberty totake all I have for your use."
"I've got a great deal more of it over there," lady Feng remarked.
"I'll tell a servant-girl to go and fetch it," Tai-yue replied.
"No need," lady Feng went on. "I'll send it over with some one. I alsohave a favour to ask of you to-morrow, so I may as well tell the servantto bring it along at the same time."
When Lin Tai-yue heard these words, she put on a smile. "You just markthis," she observed. "I've had to-day a little tea from her place, andshe at once begins making a tool of me!"
"Since you've had some of our tea," lady Feng laughed, "how is it thatyou have not yet become a wife in our household?"
The whole party burst out laughing aloud. So much so, that they found itdifficult to repress themselves. But Tai-yue's face was suffused withblushes. She turned her head the other way, and uttered not a word.
"Our sister-in-law Secunda's jibes are first-rate!" Pao-ch'ai chimed inwith a laugh.
"What jibes!" exclaimed Tai-yue; "they're purely and simply the prattleof a mean mouth and vile tongue! They're enough to evoke people'sdispleasure!"
Saying this, she went on to sputter in disgust.
"Were you," insinuated lady Feng, "to become a wife in my family, whatis there that you would lack?" Pointing then at Pao-yue, "Look here!" shecried--"Is not this human being worthy of you? Is not his station inlife good enough for you? Are not our stock and estate sufficient foryou? and in what slight degree can he make you lose caste?"
Tai-yue rose to her feet, and retired immediately. But Pao-ch'ai shoutedout: "Here's P'in Erh in a huff! Don't you yet come back? when you'vegone, there will really be no fun!"
While calling out to her, she jumped up to pull her back. As soon,however, as she reached the door of the room, she beheld Mrs. Chao,accompanied by Mrs. Chou; both coming to look up Pao-yue. Pao-yue and hiscompanions got up in a body and pressed them into a seat. Lady Feng wasthe sole person who did not heed them.
But just as Pao-ch'ai was about to open her lips, she perceived aservant-girl, attached to Madame Wang's apartments, appear on the scene."Your maternal uncle's wife has come," she said, "and she requests you,ladies and young ladies, to come out and see her."
Li Kung-ts'ai hurriedly walked away in company with lady Feng. The twodames, Mrs. Chao and Mrs. Chou, in like manner took their leave andquitted the room.
"As for me, I can't go out," Pao-yue shouted. "But whatever you do, pray,don't ask aunt to come in here." "Cousin Lin," he went on to say, "dostay on a while; I've got something to tell you."
Lady Feng overheard him. Turning her head towards Lin Tai-yue, "There'ssome one," she cried; "who wants to speak to you." And forthwith layinghold of Lin Tai-yue, she pushed her back and then trudged away, alongwith Li Kung-ts'ai.
During this time, Pao-yue clasped Tai-yue's hand in his. He did nothingthan smile. But not a word did he utter. Tai-yue naturally, therefore,got crimson in the face, and struggled to escape his importunities.
"Ai-ya!" exclaimed Pao-yue. "How my head is sore!"
"It should be!" rejoined Tai-yue. "O-mi-to-fu."
Pao-yue then gave vent to a loud shout. His body bounced three or fourfeet high from the ground. His mouth was full of confused shrieks. Butall he said was rambling talk.
Tai-yue and the servant-girls were full of consternation, and, with allpossible haste, they ran and apprised Madame Wang and dowager lady Chia.
Wang Tzu-t'eng's wife was, at this time, also with them, so they allcame in a body to see him. Pao-yue behaved more and more as if determinedto clutch a sword or seize a spear to put an end to his existence. Heraged in a manner sufficient to subvert the heavens and upset the earth.
As soon as dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang caught sight of him, theywere struck with terror. They trembled wildly like a piece of clothingthat is being shaken. Uttering a shout of: "My son," and another of: "Myflesh," they burst out into a loud fit of crying. Presently, all theinmates were seized with fright. Even Chia She, Madame Hsing, ChiaCheng, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Jung, Chia Yuen, Chia P'ing, Mrs.Hsueeh, Hsueeh P'an, Chou Jui's wife, and the various members of thehousehold, whether high or low, and the servant-girls and married womentoo, rushed into the garden to see what was up.
The confusion that prevailed was, at the moment, like entangled flax.Every one was at a loss what to do, when they espied lady Feng dash intothe garden, a glistening sword in hand, and try to cut down everythingthat came in her way, ogle vacantly whomsoever struck her gaze, and makeforthwith an attempt to despatch them. A greater panic than ever brokeout among the whole assemblage. But placing herself at the head of ahandful of sturdy female servants, Chou Jui's wife precipitated herselfforward, and clasping her tight, they succeeded in snatching the swordfrom her grip, and carrying her back into her room.
P'ing Erh, Feng Erh, and the other girls began to weep. They invoked theheavens and appealed to the earth. Even Chia Cheng was distressed atheart. One and all at this stage started shouting, some, one thing;some, another. Some suggested exorcists. Some cried out for theposture-makers to attract the devils. Others recommended that Chang, theTaoist priest, of the Yue Huang temple, should catch the evil spirits. Athorough turmoil reigned supreme for a long time. The gods wereimplored. Prayers were offered. Every kind of remedy was tried, but nobenefit whatever became visible.
After sunset, the spouse of Wang Tzu-t'eng said good-bye and took herdeparture. On the ensuing day, Wang Tzu-t'eng himself also came to makeinquiries. Following closely upon him, arrived, in a body, messengersfrom the young marquis Shih, Madame Hsing's young brother, and theirvarious relatives to ascertain for themselves how (lady Feng and Pao-yue)were progressing. Some brought charm-water. Some recommended bonzes andTaoist priests. Others spoke highly of doctors. But that young fellowand his elder brother's wife fell into such greater and greater stuporthat they lost all consciousness. Their bodies were hot like fire. Asthey lay prostrate on their beds, they talked deliriously. With the fallof the shades of night their condition aggravated. So much so, that thematrons and servant-girls did not venture to volunteer their attendance.They had, therefore, to be both moved into Madame Wang's quarters, whereservants were told off to take their turn and watch them.
Dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang, Madame Hsing and Mrs. Hsueeh did notbudge an inch or a step from their side. They sat round them, and didnothing but cry. Chia She and Chia Cheng too were a prey, at thisjuncture, to misgivings lest weeping should upset dowager lady Chia. Dayand night oil was burnt and fires were, mindless of expense, keptalight. The bustle and confusion was such that no one, either master orservant, got any rest.
Chia She also sped on every side in search of Buddhist and Taoistpriests. But Chia Cheng had witnessed how little relief these thingscould afford, and he felt constrained to dissuade Chia She from hisendeavours. "The destiny," he argued, "of our son and daughter isentirely dependent upon the will of Heaven, and no human strength canprevail. The malady of these two persons would not be healed, even wereevery kind of treatment tried, and as I feel confident that it is thedesign of heaven that things should be as they are, all we can do is toallow it to carry out its purpose."
Chia She, however, paid no notice to his remonstrances and continued ashitherto to fuss in every imaginable way. In no time three days elapsed.Lady Feng and Pao-yue were still confined to their beds. Their verybreaths had grown fainter. The whole household, therefore, unanimouslyarrived at the conclusion that there was no hope, and with all despatchthey made every necessary preparation for the subsequent requirements ofboth their relatives.
Dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang, Chia Lien, P'ing Erh, Hsi Jen and theothers indulged in tears with keener and keener anguish. They hungbetween life and death. Mrs. Chao alone was the one who assumed anoutward sham air of distress, while in her heart she felt her wishesgratified.
The fourth day arrived. At an early hour Pao-yue suddenly opened his eyesand addressed himself to his grandmother Chia. "From this day forward,"he said, "I may no longer abide in your house, so you had better send meoff at once!"
These words made dowager lady Chia feel as if her very heart had beenwrenched out of her. Mrs. Chao, who stood by, exhorted her. "Youshouldn't, venerable lady," she said, "indulge in excessive grief. Thisyoung man has been long ago of no good; so wouldn't it be as well todress him up and let him go back a moment sooner from this world. You'llalso be thus sparing him considerable suffering. But, if you persist, innot reconciling yourself to the separation and this breath of his is notcut off, he will lie there and suffer without any respite...."
Her arguments were scarcely ended, when she was spat upon by dowagerlady Chia. "You rotten-tongued, good-for-nothing hag!" she criedabusively. "What makes you fancy him of no good! You wish him dead andgone; but what benefit will you then derive? Don't give way to anydreams; for, if he does die, I'll just exact your lives from you! It'sall because you've been continuously at him, inciting and urging him toread and write, that his spirit has become so intimidated that, at thesight of his father, he behaves just like a rat trying to get out of theway of a cat! And is not all this the result of the bullying of such amean herd of women as yourselves! Could you now drive him to death, yourwishes would immediately be fulfilled; but which of you will I let off?"
Now she shed tears; now she gave vent to abuse.
Chia Cheng, who stood by, heard these invectives; and they so enhancedhis exasperation that he promptly shouted out and made Mrs. Chaowithdraw. He then exerted himself for a time to console (his senior) byusing kindly accents. But suddenly some one came to announce that thetwo coffins had been completed. This announcement pierced, like adagger, dowager lady Chia to the heart; and while weeping with despairmore intense, she broke forth in violent upbraidings.
"Who is it,"--she inquired; "who gave orders to make the coffins? Bringat once the coffin-makers and beat them to death!"
A stir ensued sufficient to convulse the heavens and to subvert theearth. But at an unforeseen moment resounded in the air the gentlerapping of a 'wooden fish' bell. A voice recited the sentence: "Ave!Buddha able to unravel retribution and dispel grievances! Should anyhuman being lie in sickness, and his family be solicitous on hisaccount; or should any one have met with evil spirits and come acrossany baleful evils, we have the means to effect a cure."
Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang at once directed servants to go outinto the street and find out who it was. It turned out to be, in fact, amangy-headed bonze and a hobbling Taoist priest. What was the appearanceof the bonze?
  His nose like a suspended gall; his two eyebrows so long,  His eyes, resembling radiant stars, possessed a precious glow,  His coat in tatters and his shoes of straw, without a home;  Rolling in filth, and, a worse fate, his head one mass of boils.
And the Taoist priest, what was he like?
  With one leg perched high he comes, with one leg low;  His whole frame drenching wet, bespattered all with mud.  If you perchance meet him, and ask him where's his home,  "In fairyland, west of the 'Weak Water,' he'll say."
Chia Cheng ordered the servants to invite them to walk in. "On whathill," he asked those two persons, "do you cultivate the principles ofreason?
"Worthy official!" the bonze smiled, "you must not ask too manyquestions! It's because we've learnt that there are inmates of yourhonourable mansion in a poor state of health that we come with theexpress design of working a cure."
"There are," explained Chia Cheng, "two of our members, who have beenpossessed of evil spirits. But, is there, I wonder, any remedy by meansof which they could he healed?"
"In your family," laughingly observed the Taoist priest, "you have readyat hand a precious thing, the like of which is rare to find in theworld. It possesses the virtue of alleviating the ailment, so why needyou inquire about remedies?"
Chia Cheng's mind was forthwith aroused. "It's true," he consequentlyrejoined, "that my son brought along with him, at the time of his birth,a piece of jade, on the surface of which was inscribed that it had thevirtue of dispelling evil influences, but we haven't seen any efficacyin it."
"There is, worthy officer," said the bonze, "something in it which youdo not understand. That precious jade was, in its primitive state,efficacious, but consequent upon its having been polluted by music,lewdness, property and gain it has lost its spiritual properties. Butproduce now that valuable thing and wait till I have taken it into myhands and pronounced incantations over it, when it will become as fullof efficacy as of old!"
Chia Cheng accordingly unclasped the piece of jade from Pao-yue's neck,and handed it to the two divines. The Buddhist priest held it withreverence in the palm of his hand and heaving a deep sigh, "Since ourparting," he cried, "at the foot of the Ch'ing Keng peak, about thirteenyears have elapsed. How time flies in the mortal world! Thine earthlydestiny has not yet been determined. Alas, alas! how admirable were thequalities thou did'st possess in those days!
 "By Heaven unrestrained, without constraint from Earth,  No joys lived in thy heart, but sorrows none as well;  Yet when perception, through refinement, thou did'st reach,  Thou went'st among mankind to trouble to give rise.  How sad the lot which thou of late hast had to hear!  Powder prints and rouge stains thy precious lustre dim.  House bars both day and night encage thee like a duck.  Deep wilt thou sleep, but from thy dream at length thou'lt wake,  Thy debt of vengeance, once discharged, thou wilt depart."
At the conclusion of this recital, he again rubbed the stone for awhile, and gave vent to some nonsensical utterances, after which hesurrendered it to Chia Cheng. "This object," he said, "has alreadyresumed its efficacy; but you shouldn't do anything to desecrate it.Hang it on the post of the door in his bed-room, and with the exceptionof his own relatives, you must not let any outside female pollute it.After the expiry of thirty-three days, he will, I can guarantee, be allright."
Chia Cheng then gave orders to present tea; but the two priests hadalready walked away. He had, however, no alternative but to comply withtheir injunctions, and lady Feng and Pao-yue, in point of fact, gotbetter from day to day. Little by little they returned to their sensesand experienced hunger. Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang, at length,felt composed in their minds. All the cousins heard the news outside.Tai-yue, previous to anything else, muttered a prayer to Buddha; whilePao-ch'ai laughed and said not a word.
"Sister Pao," inquired Hsi Ch'un, "what are you laughing for?"
"I laugh," replied Pao-ch'ai, "because the 'Thus-Come' Joss has more todo than any human being. He's got to see to the conversion of allmankind, and to take care of the ailments, to which all flesh is heir;for he restores every one of them at once to health; and he has as wellto control people's marriages so as to bring them about through his aid;and what do you say, has he ample to do or not? Now, isn't this enoughto make one laugh, eh?"
Lin Tai-yue blushed. "Ts'ui!" she exclaimed; "none of you are goodpeople. Instead of following the example of worthy persons, you try torival the mean mouth of that hussey Feng."
As she uttered these words, she raised the portiere and made her exit.
But, reader, do you want to know any further circumstances? If so, thenext chapter will explain them to you.

CHAPTER XXVI.
  On the Feng Yao bridge, Hsiao Hung makes known sentimental matters in      equivocal language.  In the Hsiao Hsiang lodge, Tai-yue gives, while under the effects of      the spring lassitude, expression to her secret feelings.
After thirty days' careful nursing, Pao-yue, we will now notice, not onlygot strong and hale in body, but the scars even on his face completelyhealed up; so he was able to shift his quarters again into the garden ofBroad Vista.
But we will banish this topic as it does not deserve any additionalexplanations. Let us now turn our attention elsewhere. During the timethat Pao-yue was of late laid up in bed, Chia Yuen along with the youngpages of the household sat up on watch to keep an eye over him, and bothday and night, they tarried on this side of the mansion. But Hsiao Hungas well as all the other waiting-maids remained in the same part tonurse Pao-yue, so (Chia Yuen) and she saw a good deal of each other onseveral occasions, and gradually an intimacy sprung up between them.
Hsiao Hung observed that Chia Yuen held in his hand a handkerchief verymuch like the one she herself had dropped some time ago and was bentupon asking him for it, but she did, on the other hand, not think shecould do so with propriety. The unexpected visit of the bonze and Taoistpriest rendered, however, superfluous the services of the various maleattendants, and Chia-yuen had therefore to go again and oversee the menplanting the trees. Now she had a mind to drop the whole question, butshe could not reconcile herself to it; and now she longed to go and askhim about it, but fears rose in her mind lest people should entertainany suspicions as to the relations that existed between them. But justas she faltered, quite irresolute, and her heart was thoroughlyunsettled, she unawares heard some one outside inquire: "Sister, are youin the room or not?"
Hsiao Hung, upon catching this question, looked out through a hole inthe window; and perceiving at a glance that it was no one else than ayoung servant-girl, attached to the same court as herself, Chia Hui byname, she consequently said by way of reply: "Yes, I am; come in!"
When these words reached her ear, Chia Hui ran in, and taking at once aseat on the bed, she observed with a smile: "How lucky I've been! I wasa little time back in the court washing a few things, when Pao-yue criedout that some tea should be sent over to Miss Lin, and sister Hua handedit to me to go on the errand. By a strange coincidence our old lady hadpresented some money to Miss Lin and she was engaged at the moment indistributing it among their servant-girls. As soon therefore as she sawme get there, Miss Lin forthwith grasped two handfuls of cash and gavethem to me; how many there are I don't know, but do keep them for me!"
Speedily then opening her handkerchief, she emptied the cash. Hsiao Hungcounted them for her by fives and tens at a time. She was beginning toput them away, when Chia Hui remarked: "How are you, after all, feelingof late in your mind? I'll tell you what; you should really go and stayat home for a couple of days. And were you to ask a doctor round and tohave a few doses of medicine you'll get all right at once!"
"What are you talking about?" Hsiao Hung replied. "What shall I go homefor, when there's neither rhyme nor reason for it!"
"Miss Lin, I remember, is naturally of a weak physique, and hasconstantly to take medicines," Chia Hui added, "so were you to ask herfor some and bring them over and take them, it would come to the samething."
"Nonsense!" rejoined Hsiao Hung, "are medicines also to be recklesslytaken ?"
"You can't so on for ever like this," continued Chia Hui; "you'rebesides loth to eat and loth to drink, and what will you be like in thelong run?"
"What's there to fear?" observed Hsiao Hung; "won't it anyhow be betterto die a little earlier? It would be a riddance!"
"Why do you deliberately come out with all this talk?" Chia Huidemurred.
"How could you ever know anything of the secrets of my heart?" HsiaoHung inquired.
Chia Hui nodded her head and gave way to reflection. "I don't think itstrange on your part," she said after a time; "for it is reallydifficult to abide in this place! Yesterday, for instance, our dowagerlady remarked that the servants in attendance had had, during all thedays that Pao-yue was ill, a good deal to put up with, and that now thathe has recovered, incense should be burnt everywhere, and the vowsfulfilled; and she expressed a wish that those in his service should,one and all, be rewarded according to their grade. I and several otherscan be safely looked upon as young in years, and unworthy to presume sohigh; so I don't feel in any way aggrieved; but how is it that one likeyou couldn't be included in the number? My heart is much annoyed at it!Had there been any fear that Hsi Jen would have got ten times more, Icould not even then have felt sore against her, for she really deservesit! I'll just tell you an honest truth; who else is there like her? Notto speak of the diligence and carefulness she has displayed all along,even had she not been so diligent and careful, she couldn't have beenset aside! But what is provoking is that that lot, like Ch'ing Wen andCh'i Hsia, should have been included in the upper class. Yet it'sbecause every one places such reliance on the fine reputation of theirfather and mother that they exalt them. Now, do tell me, is thissufficient to anger one or not?"
"It won't do to be angry with them!" Hsiao Hung observed. "The proverbsays: 'You may erect a shed a thousand _li_ long, but there is noentertainment from which the guests will not disperse!' And who is itthat will tarry here for a whole lifetime? In another three years orfive years every single one of us will have gone her own way; and whowill, when that time comes, worry her mind about any one else?"
These allusions had the unexpected effect of touching Chia Hui to theheart; and in spite of herself the very balls of her eyes got red. Butso uneasy did she feel at crying for no reason that she had to exertherself to force a smile. "What you say is true," she ventured. "Andyet, Pao-yue even yesterday explained how the rooms should be arranged byand bye; and how the clothes should be made, just as if he was bound tohang on to dear life for several hundreds of years."
Hsiao Hung, at these words, gave a couple of sardonic smiles. But whenabout to pass some remark, she perceived a youthful servant-girl, whohad not as yet let her hair grow, walk in, holding in her hands severalpatterns and two sheets of paper. "You are asked," she said, "to tracethese two designs!"
As she spoke, she threw them at Hsiao Hung, and twisting herself round,she immediately scampered away.
"Whose are they, after all?" Hsiao Hung inquired, addressing herselfoutside. "Couldn't you wait even so much as to conclude what you had tosay, but flew off at once? Who is steaming bread and waiting for you? Orare you afraid, forsooth, lest it should get cold?"
"They belong to sister Ch'i," the young servant-girl merely returned foranswer from outside the window; and raising her feet high, she rantramp-tramp on her way back again.
Hsiao Hung lost control over her temper, and snatching the designs, sheflung them on one side. She then rummaged in a drawer for a pencil, butfinding, after a prolonged search, that they were all blunt; "Where didI," she thereupon ejaculated, "put that brand-new pencil the other day?How is it I can't remember where it is?"
While she soliloquised, she became wrapt in thought. After somereflection she, at length, gave a smile. "Of course!" she exclaimed,"the other evening Ying Erh took it away." And turning towards Chia Hui,"Fetch it for me," she shouted.
"Sister Hua," Chia Hui rejoined, "is waiting for me to get a box forher, so you had better go for it yourself!"
"What!" remarked Hsiao Hung, "she's waiting for you, and are you stillsquatting here chatting leisurely? Hadn't it been that I asked you to goand fetch it, she too wouldn't have been waiting for you; you mostperverse vixen!"
With these words on her lips, she herself walked out of the room, andleaving the I Hung court, she straightway proceeded in the direction ofPao-ch'ai's court. As soon, however, as she reached the Hsin Fangpavilion, she saw dame Li, Pao-yue's nurse, appear in view from theopposite side; so Hsiao Hung halted and putting on a smile, "Nurse Li,"she asked, "where are you, old dame, bound for? How is it you're comingthis way?"
Nurse Li stopped short, and clapped her hands. "Tell me," she said, "hashe deliberately again gone and fallen in love with that Mr. something orother like Yun (cloud), or Yue (rain)? They now insist upon my bringinghim inside, but if they get wind of it by and bye in the upper rooms, itwon't again be a nice thing."
"Are you, old lady," replied Hsiao Hung smiling, "taking things in suchreal earnest that you readily believe them and want to go and ask him inhere?"
"What can I do?" rejoined nurse Li.
"Why, that fellow," added Hsiao Hung laughingly, "will, if he has anyidea of decency, do the right thing and not come."
"Besides, he's not a fool!" pleaded nurse Li; "so why shouldn't he comein?"
"Well, if he is to come," answered Hsiao Hung, "it will devolve uponyou, worthy dame, to lead him along with you; for were you by and bye tolet him penetrate inside all alone and knock recklessly about, why, itwon't do at all."
"Have I got all that leisure," retorted nurse Li, "to trudge along withhim? I'll simply tell him to come; and later on I can despatch a youngservant-girl or some old woman to bring him in, and have done."
Saying this, she continued her way, leaning on her staff.
After listening to her rejoinder, Hsiao Hung stood still; and plungingin abstraction, she did not go and fetch the pencil. But presently, shecaught sight of a servant-girl running that way. Espying Hsiao Hunglingering in that spot, "Sister Hung," she cried, "what are you doing inhere?"
Hsiao Hung raised her head, and recognised a young waiting-maid calledChui Erh. "Where are you off too?" Hsiao Hung asked.
"I've been told to bring in master Secundus, Mr. Yuen," Chui Erh replied.After which answer, she there and then departed with all speed.
Hsiao Hung reached, meanwhile, the Feng Yao bridge. As soon as sheapproached the gateway, she perceived Chui Erh coming along with ChiaYuen from the opposite direction. While advancing Chia Yuen ogled HsiaoHung; and Hsiao Hung too, though pretending to be addressing herself toChui Erh, cast a glance at Chia Yuen; and their four eyes, as luck wouldhave it, met. Hsiao Hung involuntarily blushed all over; and turningherself round, she walked off towards the Heng Wu court. But we willleave her there without further remarks.
During this time, Chia Yuen followed Chui Erh, by a circuitous way, intothe I Hung court. Chui Erh entered first and made the necessaryannouncement. Then subsequently she ushered in Chia Yuen. When Chia Yuenscrutinised the surroundings, he perceived, here and there in the court,several blocks of rockery, among which were planted banana-trees. On theopposite side were two storks preening their feathers under the firtrees. Under the covered passage were suspended, in a row, cages ofevery description, containing all sorts of fairylike, rare birds. In theupper part were five diminutive anterooms, uniformly carved with, uniquedesigns; and above the framework of the door was hung a tablet with theinscription in four huge characters--"I Hung K'uai Lue, the happy red andjoyful green."
"I thought it strange," Chia Yuen argued mentally, "that it should becalled the I Hung court; but are these, in fact, the four charactersinscribed on the tablet!"
But while he was communing within himself, he heard some one laugh andthen exclaim from the inner side of the gauze window: "Come in at once!How is it that I've forgotten you these two or three months?"
As soon as Chia Yuen recognised Pao-yue's voice, he entered the room withhurried step. On raising his head, his eye was attracted by thebrilliant splendour emitted by gold and jade and by the dazzling lustreof the elegant arrangements. He failed, however, to detect where Pao-yuewas ensconced. The moment he turned his head round, he espied, on theleft side, a large cheval-glass; behind which appeared to view, standingside by side, two servant-girls of fifteen or sixteen years of age."Master Secundus," they ventured, "please take a seat in the innerroom."
Chia Yuen could not even muster courage to look at them straight in theface; but promptly assenting, he walked into a green gauzemosquito-house, where he saw a small lacquered bed, hung with curtainsof a deep red colour, with clusters of flowers embroidered in gold.Pao-yue, wearing a house-dress and slipshod shoes, was reclining on thebed, a book in hand. The moment he perceived Chia Yuen walk in, hediscarded his book, and forthwith smiled and raised himself up. Chia Yuenhurriedly pressed forward and paid his salutation. Pao-yue then offeredhim a seat; but he simply chose a chair in the lower part of theapartment.
"Ever since the moon in which I came across you," Pao-yue observedsmilingly, "and told you to come into the library, I've had, who wouldhave thought it, endless things to continuously attend to, so that Iforgot all about you."
"It's I, indeed, who lacked good fortune!" rejoined Chia Yuen, with alaugh; "particularly so, as it again happened that you, uncle, fell ill.But are you quite right once more?"
"All right!" answered Pao-yue. "I heard that you've been put to muchtrouble and inconvenience on a good number of days!"
"Had I even had any trouble to bear," added Chia Yuen, "it would havebeen my duty to bear it. But your complete recovery, uncle, is really ablessing to our whole family."
As he spoke, he discerned a couple of servant-maids come to help him toa cup of tea. But while conversing with Pao-yue, Chia Yuen was intent uponscrutinising the girl with slim figure, and oval face, and clad in asilvery-red jacket, a blue satin waistcoat and a white silk petticoatwith narrow pleats.
At the time of Pao-yue's illness, Chia Yuen had spent a couple of days inthe inner apartments, so that he remembered half of the inmates of note,and the moment he set eyes upon this servant-girl he knew that it wasHsi Jen; and that she was in Pao-yue's rooms on a different standing tothe rest. Now therefore that she brought the tea in herself and thatPao-yue was, besides, sitting by, he rose to his feet with alacrity andput on a smile. "Sister," he said, "how is it that you are pouring teafor me? I came here to pay uncle a visit; what's more I'm no stranger,so let me pour it with my own hands!"
"Just you sit down and finish!" Pao-yue interposed; "will you also behavein this fashion with servant-girls?"
"In spite of what you say;" remarked Chia Yuen smiling, "they are youngladies attached to your rooms, uncle, and how could I presume to bedisorderly in my conduct?"
So saying, he took a seat and drank his tea. Pao-yue then talked to himabout trivial and irrelevant matters; and afterwards went on to tell himin whose household the actresses were best, and whose gardens werepretty. He further mentioned to him in whose quarters the servant-girlswere handsome, whose banquets were sumptuous, as well as in whose homewere to be found strange things, and what family possessed remarkableobjects. Chia Yuen was constrained to humour him in his conversation; butafter a chat, which lasted for some time, he noticed that Pao-yue wassomewhat listless, and he promptly stood up and took his leave. AndPao-yue too did not use much pressure to detain him. "To-morrow, if youhave nothing to do, do come over!" he merely observed; after which, heagain bade the young waiting-maid, Chui Erh, see him out.
Having left the I Hung court, Chia Yuen cast a glance all round; and,realising that there was no one about, he slackened his pace at once,and while proceeding leisurely, he conversed, in a friendly way, withChui Erh on one thing and another. First and foremost he inquired of herwhat was her age; and her name. "Of what standing are your father andmother?" he said, "How many years have you been in uncle Pao'sapartments? How much money do you get a month? In all how many girls arethere in uncle Pao's rooms?"
As Chui Erh heard the questions set to her, she readily made suitablereply to each.
"The one, who was a while back talking to you," continued Chia Yuen, "iscalled Hsiao Hung, isn't she?"
"Yes, her name is Hsiao Hung!" replied Chui Erh smiling; "but why do youask about her?"
"She inquired of you just now about some handkerchief or other,"answered Chia Yuen; "well, I've picked one up."
Chui Erh greeted this response with a smile. "Many are the times," shesaid; "that she has asked me whether I had seen her handkerchief; buthave I got all that leisure to worry my mind about such things? Shespoke to me about it again to-day; and she suggested that I should findit for her, and that she would also recompense me. This she told me whenwe were just now at the entrance of the Heng Wu court, and you too, Mr.Secundus, overheard her, so that I'm not lying. But, dear Mr. Secundus,since you've picked it up, give it to me. Do! And I'll see what she willgive me as a reward."
The truth is that Chia Yuen had, the previous moon when he had come intothe garden to attend to the planting of trees, picked up a handkerchief,which he conjectured must have been dropped by some inmate of thosegrounds; but as he was not aware whose it was, he did not consequentlypresume to act with indiscretion. But on this occasion, he overheardHsiao Hung make inquiries of Chui Erh on the subject; and concludingthat it must belong to her, he felt immeasurably delighted. Seeing,besides, how importunate Chui Erh was, he at once devised a plan withinhimself, and vehemently producing from his sleeve a handkerchief of hisown, he observed, as he turned towards Chui Erh with a smile: "As forgiving it to you, I'll do so; but in the event of your obtaining anypresent from her, you mustn't impose upon me."
Chui Erh assented to his proposal most profusely; and, taking thehandkerchief, she saw Chia Yuen out and then came back in search of HsiaoHung. But we will leave her there for the present.
We will now return to Pao-yue. After dismissing Chia Yuen, he lay in suchcomplete listlessness on the bed that he betrayed every sign of beinghalf asleep. Hsi Jen walked up to him, and seated herself on the edge ofthe bed, and pushing him, "What are you about to go to sleep again," shesaid. "Would it not do your languid spirits good if you went out for abit of a stroll?"
Upon hearing her voice, Pao-yue grasped her hand in his. "I would like togo out," he smiled, "but I can't reconcile myself to the separation fromyou!"
"Get up at once!" laughed Hsi Jen. And as she uttered these words, shepulled Pao-yue up.
"Where can I go?" exclaimed Pao-yue. "I'm quite surfeited witheverything."
"Once out you'll be all right," Hsi Jen answered, "but if you simplygive way to this languor, you'll be more than ever sick of everything atheart."
Pao-yue could not do otherwise, dull and out of sorts though he was, thanaccede to her importunities. Strolling leisurely out of the door of theroom, he amused himself a little with the birds suspended under theverandah; then he wended his steps outside the court, and followed thecourse of the Hsin Fang stream; but after admiring the golden fish for atime, he espied, on the opposite hillock, two young deer come rushingdown as swift as an arrow. What they were up to Pao-yue could notdiscern; but while abandoning himself to melancholy, he caught sight ofChia Lan, following behind, with a small bow in his hand, and hurryingdown hill in pursuit of them.
As soon as he realised that Pao-yue stood ahead of him, he speedilyhalted. "Uncle Secundus," he smiled, "are you at home? I imagined youhad gone out of doors!"
"You are up to mischief again, eh?" Pao-yue rejoined. "They've donenothing to you, and why shoot at them with your arrows?"
"I had no studies to attend to just now, so, being free with nothing todo," Chia Lan replied laughingly, "I was practising riding and archery."
"Shut up!" exclaimed Pao-yue. "When are you not engaged in practising?"
Saying this, he continued his way and straightway reached the entranceof a court. Here the bamboo foliage was thick, and the breeze sighedgently. This was the Hsiao Hsiang lodge. Pao-yue listlessly rambled in.He saw a bamboo portiere hanging down to the ground. Stillnessprevailed. Not a human voice fell on the ear. He advanced as far as thewindow. Noticing that a whiff of subtle scent stole softly through thegreen gauze casement, Pao-yue applied his face closely against the frameto peep in, but suddenly he caught the faint sound of a deep sigh andthe words: "Day after day my feelings slumber drowsily!" Uponoverhearing this exclamation, Pao-yue unconsciously began to feel a preyto inward longings; but casting a second glance, he saw Tai-yuestretching herself on the bed.
"Why is it," smiled Pao-yue, from outside the window, "that your feelingsday after day slumber drowsily?" So saying, he raised the portiere andstepped in.
The consciousness that she had not been reticent about her feelings madeTai-yue unwittingly flush scarlet. Taking hold of her sleeve, shescreened her face; and, turning her body round towards the inside, shepretended to be fast asleep. Pao-yue drew near her. He was about to pullher round when he saw Tai-yue's nurse enter the apartment, followed bytwo matrons.
"Is Miss asleep?" they said. "If so, we'll ask her over, when she wakesup."
As these words were being spoken, Tai-yue eagerly twisted herself roundand sat up. "Who's asleep?" she laughed.
"We thought you were fast asleep, Miss," smiled the two or three matronsas soon as they perceived Tai-yue get up. This greeting over, they calledTzu Chuean. "Your young mistress," they said, "has awoke; come in andwait on her!"
While calling her, they quitted the room in a body. Tai-yue remainedseated on the bed. Raising her arms, she adjusted her hair, andsmilingly she observed to Pao-yue, "When people are asleep, what do youwalk in for?"
At the sight of her half-closed starlike eyes and of her fragrantcheeks, suffused with a crimson blush, Pao-yue's feelings were of asudden awakened; so, bending his body, he took a seat on a chair, andasked with a smile: "What were you saying a short while back?"
"I wasn't saying anything," Tai-yue replied.
"What a lie you're trying to ram down my throat!" laughed Pao-yue. "Iheard all."
But in the middle of their colloquy, they saw Tzu Chuean enter. Pao-yuethen put on a smiling face. "Tzu Chuean!" he cried, "pour me a cup ofyour good tea!"
"Where's the good tea to be had?" Tzu Chuean answered. "If you want goodtea, you'd better wait till Hsi Jen comes."
"Don't heed him!" interposed Tai-yue. "Just go first and draw me somewater."
"He's a visitor," remonstrated Tzu Chuean, "and, of course, I shouldfirst pour him a cup of tea, and then go and draw the water."
With this answer, she started to serve the tea.
"My dear girl," Pao-yue exclaimed laughingly, "If I could only share thesame bridal curtain with your lovable young mistress, would I ever beable (to treat you as a servant) by making you fold the covers and makethe beds."
Lin Tai-yue at once drooped her head. "What are you saying?" sheremonstrated.
"What, did I say anything?" smiled Pao-yue.
Tai-yue burst into tears. "You've recently," she observed, "got into anew way. Whatever slang you happen to hear outside you come and tell me.And whenever you read any improper book, you poke your fun at me. What!have I become a laughing-stock for gentlemen!"
As she began to cry, she jumped down from bed, and promptly left theroom. Pao-yue was at a loss how to act. So agitated was he that hehastily ran up to her, "My dear cousin," he pleaded, "I do deservedeath; but don't go and tell any one! If again I venture to utter suchkind of language, may blisters grow on my mouth and may my tongue wasteaway!"
But while appealing to her feelings, he saw Hsi Jen approach him. "Goback at once," she cried, "and put on your clothes as master wants tosee you."
At the very mention of his father, Pao-yue felt suddenly as if struck bylightning. Regardless of everything and anything, he rushed, as fast aspossible, back to his room, and changing his clothes, he came out intothe garden. Here he discovered Pei Ming, standing at the second gateway,waiting for him.
"Do you perchance know what he wants me for?" Pao-yue inquired.
"Master, hurry out at once!" Pei Ming replied. "You must, of course, goand see him. When you get there, you are sure to find out what it's allabout."
This said, he urged Pao-yue on, and together they turned past the largepavilion. Pao-yue was, however, still labouring under suspicion, when heheard, from the corner of the wall, a loud outburst of laughter. Uponturning his head round, he caught sight of Hsueeh P'an jump out, clappinghis hands. "Hadn't I said that my uncle wanted you?" he laughed. "Wouldyou ever have rushed out with such alacrity?"
Pei Ming also laughed, and fell on his knees. But Pao-yue remained for along time under the spell of utter astonishment, before he, at length,realised that it was Hsueeh P'au who had inveigled him to come out.
Hsueeh P'an hastily made a salutation and a curtsey, and confessed hisfault. He next gave way to entreaties, saying: "Don't punish the youngservant, for it is simply I who begged him go."
Pao-yue too had then no other alternative but to smile. "I don't mindyour playing your larks on me; but why," he inquired, "did you mentionmy father? Were I to go and tell my aunt, your mother, to see to therights and the wrongs of the case, how would you like it?"
"My dear cousin," remarked Hsueeh P'an vehemently, "the primary idea Ihad in view was to ask you to come out a moment sooner and I forgot torespectfully shun the expression. But by and bye, when you wish to chaffme, just you likewise allude to my father, and we'll thus be square."
"Ai-ya!" exclaimed Pao-yue. "You do more than ever deserve death!!" Thenturning again towards Pei Ming, "You ruffian!" he said, "what are youstill kneeling for?"
Pei Ming began to bump his head on the ground with vehemence.
"Had it been for anything else," Hsueeh P'an chimed in, "I wouldn't havemade bold to disturb you; but it's simply in connection with my birthdaywhich is to-morrow, the third day of the fifth moon. Ch'eng Jih-hsing,who is in that curio shop of ours, unexpectedly brought along, goodnessknows where he fished them from, fresh lotus so thick and so long, somealy and so crisp; melons of this size; and a Siamese porpoise, thatlong and that big, smoked with cedar, such as is sent as tribute fromthe kingdom of Siam. Are not these four presents, pray, rare delicacies?The porpoise is not only expensive, but difficult to get, and that kindof lotus and melon must have cost him no end of trouble to grow! I lostno time in presenting some to my mother, and at once sent some to yourold grandmother, and my aunt. But a good many of them still remain now;and were I to eat them all alone, it would, I fear, be more than Ideserve; so I concluded, after thinking right and left, that there was,besides myself, only you good enough to partake of some. That is why Ispecially invite you to taste them. But, as luck would have it, a youngsinging-boy has also come, so what do you say to you and I having ajolly day of it?"
As they talked, they walked; and, as they walked, they reached theinterior of the library. Here they discovered a whole assemblageconsisting of Tan Kuang, Ch'eng Jih-hsing, Hu Ch'i-lai, Tan T'ing-jenand others, and the singing-boy as well. As soon as these saw Pao-yuewalk in, some paid their respects to him; others inquired how he was;and after the interchange of salutations, tea was drunk. Hsueeh P'an thengave orders to serve the wine. Scarcely were the words out of his mouththan the servant-lads bustled and fussed for a long while laying thetable. When at last the necessary arrangements had been completed, thecompany took their seats.
Pao-yue verily found the melons and lotus of an exceptional description."My birthday presents have not as yet been sent round," he felt impelledto say, a smile on his lips, "and here I come, ahead of them, totrespass on your hospitality."
"Just so!" retorted Hsueeh P'an, "but when you come to-morrow tocongratulate me we'll consider what novel kind of present you can giveme."
"I've got nothing that I can give you," rejoined Pao-yue. "As far asmoney, clothes, eatables and other such articles go, they are not reallymine: all I can call my own are such pages of characters that I maywrite, or pictures that I may draw."
"Your reference to pictures," added Hsueeh P'an smiling, "reminds me of abook I saw yesterday, containing immodest drawings; they were, truly,beautifully done. On the front page there figured also a whole lot ofcharacters. But I didn't carefully look at them; I simply noticed thename of the person, who had executed them. It was, in fact, something orother like Keng Huang. The pictures were, actually, exceedingly good!"
This allusion made Pao-yue exercise his mind with innumerableconjectures.
"Of pictures drawn from past years to the present, I have," he said,"seen a good many, but I've never come across any Keng Huang."
After considerable thought, he could not repress himself from burstingout laughing. Then asking a servant to fetch him a pencil, he wrote acouple of words on the palm of his hand. This done, he went on toinquire of Hsueeh. P'an: "Did you see correctly that it read Keng Huang?"
"How could I not have seen correctly?" ejaculated Hsueeh P'an.
Pao-yue thereupon unclenched his hand and allowed him to peruse, what waswritten in it. "Were they possibly these two characters?" he remarked."These are, in point of fact, not very dissimilar from what Keng Huanglook like?"
On scrutinising them, the company noticed the two words T'ang Yin, andthey all laughed. "They must, we fancy, have been these two characters!"they cried. "Your eyes, Sir, may, there's no saying, have suddenly growndim!"
Hsueeh P'an felt utterly abashed. "Who could have said," he smiled,"whether they were T'ang Yin or Kuo Yin, (candied silver or fruitsilver)."
As he cracked this joke, however, a young page came and announced thatMr. Feng had arrived. Pao-yue concluded that the new comer must be FengTzu-ying, the son of Feng T'ang, general with the prefix of Shen Wu."
"Ask him in at once," Hsueeh P'an and his companions shouted with onevoice.
But barely were these words out of their mouths, than they realised thatFeng Tzu-ying had already stepped in, talking and laughing as heapproached.
The company speedily rose from table and offered him a seat.
"That's right!" smiled Feng Tzu-ying. "You don't go out of doors, butremain at home and go in for high fun!"
Both Pao-yue and Hsueeh P'an put on a smile. "We haven't," they remarked,"seen you for ever so long. Is your venerable father strong and hale?"
"My father," rejoined Tzu-ying, "is, thanks to you, strong and hale; butmy mother recently contracted a sudden chill and has been unwell for acouple of days."
Hsueeh P'an discerned on his face a slight bluish wound. "With whom haveyou again been boxing," he laughingly inquired, "that you've hung upthis sign board?"
"Since the occasion," laughed Feng Tzu-ying, "on which I woundedlieutenant-colonel Ch'ou's son, I've borne the lesson in mind, and neverlost my temper. So how is it you say that I've again been boxing? Thisthing on my face was caused, when I was out shooting the other day onthe T'ieh Wang hills, by a flap from the wing of the falcon."
"When was that?" asked Pao-yue.
"I started," explained Tzu-ying, "on the 28th of the third moon and cameback only the day before yesterday."
"It isn't to be wondered at then," observed Pao-yue, "that when I wentthe other day, on the third and fourth, to a banquet at friend Shen'shouse, I didn't see you there. Yet I meant to have inquired about you;but I don't know how it slipped from my memory. Did you go alone, or didyour venerable father accompany you?"
"Of course, my father went," Tzu-ying replied, "so I had no help but togo. For is it likely, forsooth, that I've gone mad from lack of anythingto do! Don't we, a goodly number as we are, derive enough pleasure fromour wine-bouts and plays that I should go in quest of such kind offatiguing recreation! But in this instance a great piece of good fortuneturned up in evil fortune!"
Hsueeh P'an and his companions noticed that he had finished his tea."Come along," they one and all proposed, "and join the banquet; you canthen quietly recount to us all your experiences."
At this suggestion Feng Tzu-ying there and then rose to his feet."According to etiquette," he said. "I should join you in drinking a fewcups; but to-day I have still a very urgent matter to see my fatherabout on my return so that I truly cannot accept your invitation."
Hsueeh P'an, Pao-yue and the other young fellows would on no accountlisten to his excuses. They pulled him vigorously about and would notlet him go.
"This is, indeed, strange!" laughed Feng Tzu-ying. "When have you and Ihad, during all these years, to have recourse to such proceedings! Ireally am unable to comply with your wishes. But if you do insist uponmaking me have a drink, well, then bring a large cup and I'll take twocups full and finish."
After this rejoinder, the party could not but give in. Hsueeh P'an tookhold of the kettle, while Pao-yue grasped the cup, and they poured twolarge cups full. Feng Tzu-ying stood up and quaffed them with onedraught.
"But do, after all," urged Pao-yue, "finish this thing about a piece ofgood fortune in the midst of misfortune before you go."
"To tell you this to-day," smiled Feng Tzu-ying, "will be no great fun.But for this purpose I intend standing a special entertainment, andinviting you all to come and have a long chat; and, in the second place,I've also got a favour to ask of you."
Saying this, he pushed his way and was going off at once, when HsueehP'an interposed. "What you've said," he observed, "has put us more thanever on pins and needles. We cannot brook any delay. Who knows when youwill ask us round; so better tell us, and thus avoid keeping people insuspense!"
"The latest," rejoined Feng Tzu-ying, "in ten days; the earliest ineight." With this answer he went out of the door, mounted his horse, andtook his departure.
The party resumed their seats at table. They had another bout, and theneventually dispersed.
Pao-yue returned into the garden in time to find Hsi Jen thinking withsolicitude that he had gone to see Chia Cheng and wondering whether itforeboded good or evil. As soon as she perceived Pao-yue come back in adrunken state, she felt urged to inquire the reason of it all. Pao-yuetold her one by one the particulars of what happened.
"People," added Hsi Jen, "wait for you with lacerated heart and anxiousmind, and there you go and make merry; yet you could very well, afterall, have sent some one with a message."
"Didn't I purpose sending a message?" exclaimed Pao-yue. "Of course, Idid! But I failed to do so, as on the arrival of friend Feng, I got somixed up that the intention vanished entirely from my mind."
While excusing himself, he saw Pao-ch'ai enter the apartment. "Have youtasted any of our new things?" she asked, a smile curling her lips.
"Cousin," laughed Pao-yue, "you must have certainly tasted what you'vegot in your house long before us."
Pao-ch'ai shook her head and smiled. "Yesterday," she said, "my brotherdid actually make it a point to ask me to have some; but I had none; Itold him to keep them and send them to others, so confident am I thatwith my mean lot and scanty blessings I little deserve to touch suchdainties."
As she spoke, a servant-girl poured her a cup of tea and brought it toher. While she sipped it, she carried on a conversation on irrelevantmatters; which we need not notice, but turn our attention to Lin Tai-yue.
The instant she heard that Chia Cheng had sent for Pao-yue, and that hehad not come back during the whole day, she felt very distressed on hisaccount. After supper, the news of Pao-yue's return reached her, and shekeenly longed to see him and ask him what was up. Step by step shetrudged along, when espying Pao-ch'ai going into Pao-yue's garden, sheherself followed close in her track. But on their arrival at the HsinFang bridge, she caught sight of the various kinds of water-fowl,bathing together in the pond, and although unable to discriminate thenumerous species, her gaze became so transfixed by their respectivevariegated and bright plumage and by their exceptional beauty, that shehalted. And it was after she had spent some considerable time inadmiring them that she repaired at last to the I Hung court. The gatewas already closed. Tai-yue, however, lost no time in knocking. ButCh'ing Wen and Pi Hen had, who would have thought it, been having atiff, and were in a captious mood, so upon unawares seeing Pao-ch'aistep on the scene, Ch'ing Wen at once visited her resentment uponPao-ch'ai. She was just standing in the court giving vent to her wrongs,shouting: "You're always running over and seating yourself here, whetheryou've got good reason for doing so or not; and there's no sleep for usat the third watch, the middle of the night though it be," when, all ofa sudden, she heard some one else calling at the door. Ch'ing Wen wasthe more moved to anger. Without even asking who it was, she rapidlybawled out: "They've all gone to sleep; you'd better come to-morrow."
Lin Tai-yue was well aware of the natural peculiarities of thewaiting-maids, and of their habit of playing practical jokes upon eachother, so fearing that the girl in the inner room had failed torecognise her voice, and had refused to open under the misconceptionthat it was some other servant-girl, she gave a second shout in a higherpitch. "It's I!" she cried, "don't you yet open the gate?"
Ch'ing Wen, as it happened, did not still distinguish her voice; and inan irritable strain, she rejoined: "It's no matter who you may be; Mr.Secundus has given orders that no one at all should be allowed to comein."
As these words reached Lin Tai-yue's ear, she unwittingly was overcomewith indignation at being left standing outside. But when on the pointof raising her voice to ask her one or two things, and to start aquarrel with her; "albeit," she again argued mentally, "I can call thismy aunt's house, and it should be just as if it were my own, it's, afterall, a strange place, and now that my father and mother are both dead,and that I am left with no one to rely upon, I have for the present todepend upon her family for a home. Were I now therefore to give way to aregular fit of anger with her, I'll really get no good out of it."
While indulging in reflection, tears trickled from her eyes. But just asshe was feeling unable to retrace her steps, and unable to remainstanding any longer, and quite at a loss what to do, she overheard thesound of jocular language inside, and listening carefully, shediscovered that it was, indeed, Pao-yue and Pao-ch'ai. Lin Tai-yue waxedmore wroth. After much thought and cogitation, the incidents of themorning flashed unawares through her memory. "It must, in fact," shemused, "be because Pao-yue is angry with me for having explained to himthe true reasons. But why did I ever go and tell you? You should,however, have made inquiries before you lost your temper to such anextent with me as to refuse to let me in to-day; but is it likely thatwe shall not by and bye meet face to face again?"
The more she gave way to thought, the more she felt wounded andagitated; and without heeding the moss, laden with cold dew, the pathcovered with vegetation, and the chilly blasts of wind, she lingered allalone, under the shadow of the bushes at the corner of the wall, sothoroughly sad and dejected that she broke forth into sobs.
Lin Tai-yue was, indeed, endowed with exceptional beauty and with charmsrarely met with in the world. As soon therefore as she suddenly meltedinto tears, and the birds and rooks roosting on the neighbouring willowboughs and branches of shrubs caught the sound of her plaintive tones,they one and all fell into a most terrific flutter, and, taking to theirwings, they flew away to distant recesses, so little were they able tolisten with equanimity to such accents. But the spirits of the flowerswere, at the time, silent and devoid of feeling, the birds were plungedin dreams and in a state of stupor, so why did they start? A stanzaappositely assigns the reason:--
  P'in Erh's mental talents and looks must in the world be rare--.  Alone, clasped in a subtle smell, she quits her maiden room.  The sound of but one single sob scarcely dies away,  And drooping flowers cover the ground and birds fly in dismay.
Lin Tai-yue was sobbing in her solitude, when a creaking noise struck herear and the door of the court was flung open. Who came out, is not yetascertained; but, reader, should you wish to know, the next chapter willexplain.

CHAPTER XXVII
  In the Ti Ts'ui pavilion, Pao-ch'ai diverts herself with the      multi-coloured butterflies.  Over the mound, where the flowers had been interred, Tai-yue bewails      their withered bloom.
Lin Tai-yue, we must explain in taking up the thread of our narrative,was disconsolately bathed in tears, when her ear was suddenly attractedby the creak of the court gate, and her eyes by the appearance ofPao-ch'ai beyond the threshold. Pao-yue, Hsi Jen and a whole posse ofinmates then walked out. She felt inclined to go up to Pao-yue and askhim a question; but dreading that if she made any inquiries in thepresence of such a company, Pao-yue would be put to the blush and placedin an awkward position, she slipped aside and allowed Pao-ch'ai toprosecute her way. And it was only after Pao-yue and the rest of theparty had entered and closed the gate behind them that she at lastissued from her retreat. Then fixing her gaze steadfastly on thegateway, she dropped a few tears. But inwardly conscious of their utterfutility she retraced her footsteps and wended her way back into herapartment. And with heavy heart and despondent spirits, she divestedherself of the remainder of her habiliments.
Tzu Chuean and Hsueeh Yen were well aware, from the experience they hadreaped in past days, that Lin Tai-yue was, in the absence of anything tooccupy her mind, prone to sit and mope, and that if she did not frownher eyebrows, she anyway heaved deep sighs; but they were quite at aloss to divine why she was, with no rhyme or reason, ever so ready toindulge, to herself, in inexhaustible gushes of tears. At first, therewere such as still endeavoured to afford her solace; or who, suspectinglest she brooded over the memory of her father and mother, felthome-sick, or aggrieved, through some offence given her, tried by everypersuasion to console and cheer her; but, as contrary to allexpectations, she subsequently persisted time and again in this dullmood, through each succeeding month and year, people got accustomed toher eccentricities and did not extend to her the least sympathy. Henceit was that no one (on this occasion) troubled her mind about her, butletting her sit and sulk to her heart's content, they one and all turnedin and went to sleep.
Lin Tai-yue leaned against the railing of the bed, clasping her kneeswith both hands, her eyes suffused with tears. She looked, in verytruth, like a carved wooden image or one fashioned of mud. There she satstraight up to the second watch, even later, when she eventually fellasleep.
The whole night nothing remarkable transpired. The morrow was the 26thday of the fourth moon. Indeed on this day, at one p.m., commenced theseason of the 'Sprouting seeds,' and, according to an old custom, on theday on which this feast of 'Sprouting seeds' fell, every one had to layall kinds of offerings and sacrificial viands on the altar of the god offlowers. Soon after the expiry of this season of 'Sprouting seeds'follows summertide, and us plants in general then wither and the god offlowers resigns his throne, it is compulsory to feast him at someentertainment, previous to his departure.
In the ladies' apartments this custom was observed with still morerigour; and, for this reason, the various inmates Of the park of BroadVista had, without a single exception, got up at an early hour. Theyoung people either twisted flowers and willow twigs in such a way as torepresent chairs and horses, or made tufted banners with damask,brocaded gauze and silk, and bound them with variegated threads. Thesearticles of decoration were alike attached on every tree and plant; andthroughout the whole expanse of the park, embroidered sashes waved toand fro, and ornamented branches nodded their heads about. In additionto this, the members of the family were clad in such fineries that theyput the peach tree to shame, made the almond yield the palm, the swallowenvious and the hawk to blush. We could not therefore exhaustivelydescribe them within our limited space of time.
Pao-ch'ai, Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un, Li Wan, lady Feng andother girls, as well as Ta Chieh Erh, Hsiang Ling and the waiting-maidswere, one and all, we will now notice, in the garden enjoyingthemselves; the only person who could not be seen was Lin Tai-yue.
"How is it," consequently inquired Ying Ch'un, "that I don't see cousinLiu? What a lazy girl! Is she forsooth fast asleep even at this latehour of the day?"
"Wait all of you here," rejoined Pao-ch'ai, "and I'll go and shake herup and bring her."
With these words, she speedily left her companions and repairedstraightway into the Hsiao Hsiang lodge.
While she was going on her errand, she met Wen Kuan and the rest of thegirls, twelve in all, on their way to seek the party. Drawing near, theyinquired after her health. After exchanging a few commonplace remarks,Pao-ch'ai turned round and pointing, said: "you will find them all inthere; you had better go and join them. As for me, I'm going to fetchMiss Lin, but I'll be back soon."
Saying this, she followed the winding path, and came to the Hsiao Hsianglodge. Upon suddenly raising her eyes, she saw Pao-yue walk in. Pao-ch'aiimmediately halted, and, lowering her head, she gave way to meditationfor a time. "Pao-yue and Lin Tai-yue," she reflected, "have grown uptogether from their very infancy. But cousins, though they be, there aremany instances in which they cannot evade suspicion, for they jokewithout heeding propriety; and at one time they are friends and atanother at daggers drawn. Tai-yue has, moreover, always been full ofenvy; and has ever displayed a peevish disposition, so were I to followhim in at this juncture, why, Pao-yue would, in the first place, not feelat ease, and, in the second, Tai-yue would give way to jealousy. Bettertherefore for me to turn back."
At the close of this train of thought, she retraced her steps. But justas she was starting to join her other cousins, she unexpectedlydescried, ahead of her, a pair of jade-coloured butterflies, of the sizeof a circular fan. Now they soared high, now they made a swoop down, intheir flight against the breeze; much to her amusement.
Pao-ch'ai felt a wish to catch them for mere fun's sake, so producing afan from inside her sleeve, she descended on to the turfed ground toflap them with it. The two butterflies suddenly were seen to rise;suddenly to drop: sometimes to come; at others to go. Just as they wereon the point of flying across the stream to the other side, theenticement proved too much for Pao-ch'ai, and she pursued them on tiptoestraight up to the Ti Ts'ui pavilion, nestling on the bank of the pond;while fragrant perspiration dripped drop by drop, and her sweet breathpanted gently. But Pao-ch'ai abandoned the idea of catching them, andwas about to beat a retreat, when all at once she overheard, in thepavilion, the chatter of people engaged in conversation.
This pavilion had, it must be added, a verandah and zig-zag balustradesrunning all round. It was erected over the water, in the centre of apond, and had on the four sides window-frames of carved wood work, stuckwith paper. So when Pao-ch'ai caught, from without the pavilion, thesound of voices, she at once stood still and lent an attentive ear towhat was being said.
"Look at this handkerchief," she overheard. "If it's really the oneyou've lost, well then keep it; but if it isn't you must return it toMr. Yuen."
"To be sure it is my own," another party observed, "bring it along andgive it to me."
"What reward will you give me?" she further heard. "Is it likely thatI've searched all for nothing!"
"I've long ago promised to recompense you, and of course I won't playyou false," some one again rejoined.
"I found it and brought it round," also reached her ear, "and younaturally will recompense me; but won't you give anything to the personwho picked it up?"
"Don't talk nonsense," the other party added, "he belongs to a family ofgentlemen, and anything of ours he may pick up it's his bounden duty torestore to us. What reward could you have me give him?"
"If you don't reward him," she heard some one continue, "what will I beable to tell him? Besides, he enjoined me time after time that if therewas to be no recompense, I was not to give it to you."
A short pause ensued. "Never mind!" then came out again to her, "takethis thing of mine and present it to him and have done! But do you meanto let the cat out of the bag with any one else? You should take someoath."
"If I tell any one," she likewise overheard, "may an ulcer grow on mymouth, and may I, in course of time, die an unnatural death!"
"Ai-ya!" was the reply she heard; "our minds are merely bent upontalking, but some one might come and quietly listen from outside;wouldn't it be as well to push all the venetians open. Any one seeing usin here will then imagine that we are simply chatting about nonsense.Besides, should they approach, we shall be able to observe them, and atonce stop our conversation!"
Pao-ch'ai listened to these words from outside, with a heart full ofastonishment. "How can one wonder," she argued mentally, "if all thoselewd and dishonest people, who have lived from olden times to thepresent, have devised such thorough artifices! But were they now to openand see me here, won't they feel ashamed. Moreover, the voice in whichthose remarks were uttered resembles very much that of Hung Erh,attached to Pao-yue's rooms, who has all along shown a sharp eye and ashrewd mind. She's an artful and perverse thing of the first class! Andas I have now overheard her peccadilloes, and a person in despair rebelsas sure as a dog in distress jumps over the wall, not only will troublearise, but I too shall derive no benefit. It would be better at presenttherefore for me to lose no time in retiring. But as I fear I mayn't bein time to get out of the way, the only alternative for me is to makeuse of some art like that of the cicada, which can divest itself of its_exuviae_."
She had scarcely brought her reflections to a close before a sound of'ko-chih' reached her ears. Pao-ch'ai purposely hastened to tread withheavy step. "P'in Erh, I see where you're hiding!" she cried outlaughingly; and as she shouted, she pretended to be running ahead inpursuit of her.
As soon as Hsiao Hung and Chui Erh pushed the windows open from insidethe pavilion, they heard Pao-ch'ai screaming, while rushing forward; andboth fell into a state of trepidation from the fright they sustained.
Pao-ch'ai turned round and faced them. "Where have you been hiding MissLin?" she smiled.
"Who has seen anything of Miss Lin," retorted Chui Erh.
"I was just now," proceeded Pao-ch'ai, "on that side of the pool, anddiscerned Miss Lin squatting down over there and playing with the water.I meant to have gently given her a start, but scarcely had I walked upto her, when she saw me, and, with a _detour_ towards the East, sheat once vanished from sight. So mayn't she be concealing herself inthere?"
As she spoke, she designedly stepped in and searched about for her. Thisover, she betook herself away, adding: "she's certain to have got againinto that cave in the hill, and come across a snake, which must havebitten her and put an end to her."
So saying, she distanced them, feeling again very much amused. "I havemanaged," she thought, "to ward off this piece of business, but I wonderwhat those two think about it."
Hsiao Hung, who would have anticipated, readily credited as gospel theremarks she heard Pao-ch'ai make. But allowing just time enough toPao-ch'ai to got to a certain distance, she instantly drew Chui Erh toher. "Dreadful!" she observed, "Miss Lin was squatting in here and mustfor a certainty have overheard what we said before she left."
Albeit Chui Erh listened to her words, she kept her own counsel for along time. "What's to be done?" Hsiao Hung consequently exclaimed.
"Even supposing she did overhear what we said," rejoined Chui Erh by wayof answer, "why should she meddle in what does not concern her? Everyone should mind her own business."
"Had it been Miss Pao, it would not have mattered," remarked Hsiao Hung,"but Miss Lin delights in telling mean things of people and is, besides,so petty-minded. Should she have heard and anything perchance comes tolight, what will we do?"
During their colloquy, they noticed Wen Kuan, Hsiang Ling, Ssu Ch'i,Shih Shu and the other girls enter the pavilion, so they were compelledto drop the conversation and to play and laugh with them. They thenespied lady Feng standing on the top of the hillock, waving her hand,beckoning to Hsiao Hung. Hurriedly therefore leaving the company, sheran up to lady Feng and with smile heaped upon smile, "my lady," sheinquired, "what is it that you want?"
Lady Feng scrutinised her for a time. Observing how spruce and prettyshe was in looks, and how genial in her speech, she felt prompted togive her a smile. "My own waiting-maid," she said, "hasn't followed mein here to-day; and as I've just this moment bethought myself ofsomething and would like to send some one on an errand, I wonder whetheryou're fit to undertake the charge and deliver a message faithfully."
"Don't hesitate in entrusting me with any message you may have to send,"replied Hsiao Hung with a laugh. "I'll readily go and deliver it. ShouldI not do so faithfully, and blunder in fulfilling your business, mylady, you may visit me with any punishment your ladyship may please, andI'll have nothing to say."
"What young lady's servant are you," smiled lady Feng? "Tell me, so thatwhen she comes back, after I've sent you out, and looks for you, I maybe able to tell her about you."
"I'm attached to our Master Secundus,' Mr. Pao's rooms," answered HsiaoHung.
"Ai-ya!" ejaculated lady Feng, as soon as she heard these words. "Areyou really in Pao-yue's rooms! How strange! Yet it comes to the samething. Well, if he asks for you, I'll tell him where you are. Go now toour house and tell your sister P'ing that she'll find on the table inthe outer apartment and under the stand with the plate from the Ju kiln,a bundle of silver; that it contains the one hundred and twenty taelsfor the embroiderers' wages; and that when Chang Ts'ai's wife comes, themoney should be handed to her to take away, after having been weighed inher presence and been given to her to tally. Another thing too I want.In the inner apartment and at the head of the bed you'll find a smallpurse, bring it along to me."
Hsiao Hung listened to her orders and then started to carry them out. Onher return, in a short while, she discovered that lady Feng was not onthe hillock. But perceiving Ssu Ch'i egress from the cave and standstill to tie her petticoat, she walked up to her. "Sister, do you knowwhere our lady Secunda is gone to?" she asked.
"I didn't notice," rejoined Ssu Ch'i.
At this reply, Hsiao Hung turned round and cast a glance on all fourquarters. Seeing T'an Ch'un and Pao-ch'ai standing by the bank of thepond on the opposite side and looking at the fish, Hsiao Hung advancedup to them. "Young ladies," she said, straining a smile, "do youperchance have any idea where our lady Secunda is gone to now?"
"Go into your senior lady's court and look for her!" T'an Ch'unanswered.
Hearing this, Hsiao Hung was proceeding immediately towards the TaoHsiang village, when she caught sight, just ahead of her, of Ch'ing Wen,Ch'i Hsia, Pi Hen, Ch'iu Wen, She Yueeh, Shih Shu, Ju Hua, Ying Erh andsome other girls coming towards her in a group.
The moment Ch'ing Wen saw Hsiao Hung, she called out to her. "Are yougone clean off your head?" she exclaimed. "You don't water the flowers,nor feed the birds or prepare the tea stove, but gad about outside!"
"Yesterday," replied Hsiao Hung, "Mr. Secundus told me that there was noneed for me to water the flowers to-day; that it was enough if they werewatered every other day. As for the birds, you're still in the arms ofMorpheus, sister, when I give them their food."
"And what about the tea-stove?" interposed Pi Hen.
"To-day," retorted Hsiao Hung, "is not my turn on duty, so don't ask mewhether there be any tea or not!"
"Do you listen to that mouth of hers!" cried Ch'i Hsia, "but don't yougirls speak to her; let her stroll about and have done!"
"You'd better all go and ask whether I've been gadding about or not,"continued Hsiao Hung. "Our lady Secunda has just bidden me go anddeliver a message, and fetch something."
Saying this, she raised the purse and let them see it; and they, findingthey could hit upon nothing more to taunt her with, trudged alongonwards.
Ch'ing Wen smiled a sarcastic smile. "How funny!" she cried. "Lo, sheclimbs up a high branch and doesn't condescend to look at any one of us!All she told her must have been just some word or two, who knows! But isit likely that our lady has the least notion of her name or surname thatshe rides such a high horse, and behaves in this manner! What credit isit in having been sent on a trifling errand like this! Will we, by andbye, pray, hear anything more about you? If you've got any gumption,you'd better skedaddle out of this garden this very day. For, mind, it'sonly if you manage to hold your lofty perch for any length of time thatyou can be thought something of!"
As she derided her, she continued on her way.
During this while, Hsiao Hung listened to her, but as she did not findit a suitable moment to retaliate, she felt constrained to suppress herresentment and go in search of lady Feng.
On her arrival at widow Li's quarters, she, in point of fact, discoveredlady Feng seated inside with her having a chat. Hsiao Hung approachedher and made her report. "Sister P'ing says," she observed, "that assoon as your ladyship left the house, she put the money by, and thatwhen Chang Ts'ai's wife went in a little time to fetch it, she had itweighed in her presence, after which she gave it to her to take away."
With these words, she produced the purse and presented it to her."Sister P'ing bade me come and tell your ladyship," she added,continuing, "that Wang Erh came just now to crave your orders, as to whoare the parties from whom he has to go and (collect interest on moneydue) and sister P'ing explained to him what your wishes were and senthim off."
"How could she tell him where I wanted him to go?" Lady Feng laughed.
"Sister P'ing says," Hsiao Hung proceeded, "that our lady presents hercompliments to your ladyship (widow Li) here-(_To lady Feng_) thatour master Secundus has in fact not come home, and that albeit a delayof (a day) or two will take place (in the collection of the money), yourladyship should, she begs, set your mind at ease. (_To Li Wan_).That when lady Quinta is somewhat better, our lady will let lady Quintaknow and come along with her to see your ladyship. (_To ladyFeng_). That lady Quinta sent a servant the day before yesterday tocome over and say that our lady, your worthy maternal aunt, haddespatched a letter to inquire after your ladyship's health; that shealso wished to ask you, my lady, her worthy niece in here, for a coupleof 'long-life-great-efficacy-full-of-every-virtue' pills; and that ifyou have any, they should, when our lady bids a servant come over, besimply given her to bring to our lady here, and that any one boundto-morrow for that side could then deliver them on her way to herladyship, your aunt yonder, to take along with her."
"Ai-yo-yo!" exclaimed widow Li, before the close of the message. "It'simpossible for me to make out what you're driving at! What a heap ofladyships and misters!"
"It's not to be wondered at that you can't make them out," interposedlady Feng laughing. "Why, her remarks refer to four or five distinctfamilies."
While speaking, she again faced Hsiao Hung. "My dear girl," she smiled,"what a trouble you've been put to! But you speak decently, and unlikethe others who keep on buzz-buzz-buzz, like mosquitoes! You're notaware, sister-in-law, that I actually dread uttering a word to any ofthe girls outside the few servant-girls and matrons in my own immediateservice; for they invariably spin out, what could be condensed in asingle phrase, into a long interminable yarn, and they munch and chewtheir words; and sticking to a peculiar drawl, they groan and moan; somuch so, that they exasperate me till I fly into a regular rage. Yet howare they to know that our P'ing Erh too was once like them. But when Iasked her: 'must you forsooth imitate the humming of a mosquito, inorder to be accounted a handsome girl?' and spoke to her, on severaloccasions, she at length improved considerably."
"What a good thing it would be," laughed Li Kung-ts'ai, "if they couldall be as smart as you are."
"This girl is first-rate!" rejoined lady Feng, "she just now deliveredtwo messages. They didn't, I admit, amount to much, yet to listen toher, she spoke to the point."
"To-morrow," she continued, addressing herself to Hsiao Hung smilingly,"come and wait on me, and I'll acknowledge you as my daughter; and themoment you come under my control, you'll readily improve."
At this news, Hsiao Hung spurted out laughing aloud.
"What are you laughing for?" Lady Feng inquired. "You must say toyourself that I am young in years and that how much older can I be thanyourself to become your mother; but are you under the influence of aspring dream? Go and ask all those people older than yourself. Theywould be only too ready to call me mother. But snapping my fingers atthem, I to-day exalt you."
"I wasn't laughing about that," Hsiao Hung answered with a smiling face."I was amused by the mistake your ladyship made about our generations.Why, my mother claims to be your daughter, my lady, and are you nowgoing to recognise me too as your daughter?"
"Who's your mother?" Lady Feng exclaimed.
"Don't you actually know her?" put in Li Kung-ts'ai with a smile. "She'sLin Chih-hsiao's child."
This disclosure greatly surprised lady Feng. "What!" she consequentlycried, "is she really his daughter?"
"Why Lin Chih-hsiao and his wife," she resumed smilingly, "couldn'teither of them utter a sound if even they were pricked with an awl.I've always maintained that they're a well-suited couple; as the one isas deaf as a post, and the other as dumb as a mute. But who would everhave expected them to have such a clever girl! By how much are you inyour teens?"
"I'm seventeen," replied Hsia Hung.
"What is your name?" she went on to ask.
"My name was once Hung Yue." Hsiao Hung rejoined. "But as it was aduplicate of that of Master Secundus, Mr. Pao-yue, I'm now simply calledHsiao Hung."
Upon hearing this explanation, lady Feng raised her eyebrows into afrown, and turning her head round: "It's most disgusting!" she remarked,"Those bearing the name Yue would seem to be very cheap; for your name isYue, and so is also mine Yue. Sister-in-law," she then observed; "I neverlet you know anything about it, but I mentioned to her mother that LaiTa's wife has at present her hands quite full, and that she hasn'teither any notion as to who is who in this mansion. 'You had better,' (Isaid), 'carefully select a couple of girls for my service.' She assentedunreservedly, but she put it off and never chose any. On the contrary,she sent this girl to some other place. But is it likely that shewouldn't have been well off with me?"
"Here you are again full of suspicion!" Li Wan laughed. "She came inhere long before you ever breathed a word to her! So how could you beara grudge against her mother?"
"Well, in that case," added lady Feng, "I'll speak to Pao-yue to-morrow,and induce him to find another one, and to allow this girl to come alongwith me. I wonder, however, whether she herself is willing or not?"
"Whether willing or not," interposed Hsiao Hung smiling, "such as wecouldn't really presume to raise our voices and object. We should feelit our privilege to serve such a one as your ladyship, and learn alittle how to discriminate when people raise or drop their eyebrows andeyes (with pleasure or displeasure), and reap as well some experience insuch matters as go out or come in, whether high or low, great andsmall."
But during her reply, she perceived Madame Wang's waiting-maid come andinvite lady Feng to go over. Lady Feng bade good-bye at once to LiKung-ts'ai and took her departure.
Hsiao Hung then returned into the I Hung court, where we will leave herand devote our attention for the present to Lin Tai-yue.
As she had had but little sleep in the night, she got up the next day ata late hour. When she heard that all her cousins were collected in thepark, giving a farewell entertainment for the god of flowers, shehastened, for fear people should laugh at her for being lazy, to combher hair, perform her ablutions, and go out and join them. As soon asshe reached the interior of the court, she caught sight of Pao-yue,entering the door, who speedily greeted her with a smile. "My dearcousin," he said, "did you lodge a complaint against me yesterday? I'vebeen on pins and needles the whole night long."
Tai-yue forthwith turned her head away. "Put the room in order," sheshouted to Tzu Chuean, "and lower one of the gauze window-frames. Andwhen you've seen the swallows come back, drop the curtain; keep it downthen by placing the lion on it, and after you have burnt the incense,mind you cover the censer."
So saying she stepped outside.
Pao-yue perceiving her manner, concluded again that it must be on accountof the incident of the previous noon, but how could he have had any ideaabout what had happened in the evening? He kept on still bowing andcurtseying; but Lin Tai-yue did not even so much as look at him straightin the face, but egressing alone out of the door of the court, sheproceeded there and then in search of the other girls.
Pao-yue fell into a despondent mood and gave way to conjectures.
"Judging," he reflected, "from this behaviour of hers, it would seem asif it could not be for what transpired yesterday. Yesterday too I cameback late in the evening, and, what's more, I didn't see her, so thatthere was no occasion on which I could have given her offence."
As he indulged in these reflections, he involuntarily followed in herfootsteps to try and catch her up, when he descried Pao-ch'ai andT'an-ch'un on the opposite side watching the frolics of the storks.
As soon as they saw Tai-yue approach, the trio stood together and starteda friendly chat. But noticing Pao-yue also come up, T'an Ch'un smiled."Brother Pao," she said, "are you all right. It's just three days that Ihaven't seen anything of you?"
"Are you sister quite well?" Pao-yue rejoined, a smile on his lips. "Theother day, I asked news of you of our senior sister-in-law."
"Brother Pao," T'an Ch'un remarked, "come over here; I want to tell yousomething."
The moment Pao-yue heard this, he quickly went with her. DistancingPao-ch'ai and Tai-yue, the two of them came under a pomegranate tree."Has father sent for you these last few days?" T'an Ch'un then asked.
"He hasn't," Pao-yue answered laughingly by way of reply.
"Yesterday," proceeded T'an Ch'un, "I heard vaguely something or otherabout father sending for you to go out."
"I presume," Pao-yue smiled, "that some one must have heard wrong, for henever sent for me."
"I've again managed to save during the last few months," added T'anCh'un with another smile, "fully ten tiaos, so take them and bring me,when at any time you stroll out of doors, either some fine writings orsome ingenious knicknack."
"Much as I have roamed inside and outside the city walls," answeredPao-yue, "and seen grand establishments and large temples, I've nevercome across anything novel or pretty. One simply sees articles made ofgold, jade, copper and porcelain, as well as such curios for which wecould find no place here. Besides these, there are satins, eatables, andwearing apparel."
"Who cares for such baubles!" exclaimed T'an Ch'un. "How could they comeup to what you purchased the last time; that wee basket, made of willowtwigs, that scent-box, scooped out of a root of real bamboo, thatportable stove fashioned of glutinous clay; these things were, oh, sovery nice! I was as fond of them as I don't know what; but, who'd havethought it, they fell in love with them and bundled them all off, justas if they were precious things."
"Is it things of this kind that you really want?" laughed Pao-yue. "Why,these are worth nothing! Were you to take a hundred cash and give themto the servant-boys, they could, I'm sure, bring two cart-loads ofthem."
"What do the servant-boys know?" T'an Ch'un replied. "Those you chosefor me were plain yet not commonplace. Neither were they of coarse make.So were you to procure me as many as you can get of them, I'll work youa pair of slippers like those I gave you last time, and spend twice asmuch trouble over them as I did over that pair you have. Now, what doyou say to this bargain?"
"Your reference to this," smiled Pao-yue, "reminds me of an old incident.One day I had them on, and by a strange coincidence, I met father, whosefancy they did not take, and he inquired who had worked them. But howcould I muster up courage to allude to the three words: my sisterTertia, so I answered that my maternal aunt had given them to me on therecent occasion of my birthday. When father heard that they had beengiven to me by my aunt, he could not very well say anything. But after awhile, 'why uselessly waste,' he observed, 'human labour, and throw awaysilks to make things of this sort!' On my return, I told Hsi Jen aboutit. 'Never mind,' said Hsi Jen; but Mrs. Chao got angry. 'Her ownbrother,' she murmured indignantly, 'wears slipshod shoes and socks inholes, and there's no one to look after him, and does she go and workall these things!'"
T'an Ch'un, hearing this, immediately lowered her face. "Now tell me,aren't these words utter rot!" she shouted. "What am I that I have tomake shoes? And is it likely that Huan Erh hasn't his own share ofthings! Clothes are clothes, and shoes and socks are shoes and socks;and how is it that any grudges arise in the room of a mere servant-girland old matron? For whose benefit does she come out with all thesethings! I simply work a pair or part of a pair when I am at leisure,with time on my hands. And I can give them to any brother, elder oryounger, I fancy; and who has a right to interfere with me? This is justanother bit of blind anger!"
After listening to her, Pao-yue nodded his head and smiled. "Yet," hesaid, "you don't know what her motives may be. It's but natural that sheshould also cherish some expectations."
This apology incensed T'an Ch'un more than ever, and twisting her headround, "Even you have grown dull!" she cried. "She does, of course,indulge in expectations, but they are actuated by some underhand andpaltry notion! She may go on giving way to these ideas, but I, for mypart, will only care for Mr. Chia Cheng and Madame Wang. I won't care arap for any one else. In fact, I'll be nice with such of my sisters andbrothers, as are nice to me; and won't even draw any distinction betweenthose born of primary wives and those of secondary ones. Properlyspeaking, I shouldn't say these things about her, but she'snarrow-minded to a degree, and unlike what she should be. There'sbesides another ridiculous thing. This took place the last time I gaveyou the money to get me those trifles. Well, two days after that, shesaw me, and she began again to represent that she had no money and thatshe was hard up. Nevertheless, I did not worry my brain with her goingson. But as it happened, the servant-girls subsequently quitted the room,and she at once started finding fault with me. 'Why,' she asked, 'do Igive you my savings to spend and don't, after all, let Huan Erh havethem and enjoy them?' When I heard these reproaches, I felt bothinclined to laugh, and also disposed to lose my temper; but I there andthen skedaddled out of her quarters, and went over to our Madame Wang."
As she was recounting this incident, "Well," she overheard Pao-ch'aisarcastically observe from the opposite direction, "have you donespinning your yarns? If you have, come along! It's quite evident thatyou are brother and sister, for here you leave every one else and go anddiscuss your own private matters. Couldn't we too listen to a singlesentence of what you have to say?"
While she taunted them, T'an Ch'un and Pao-yue eventually drew near herwith smiling faces.
Pao-yue, however, failed to see Lin Tai-yue and he concluded that she haddodged out of the way and gone elsewhere. "It would be better," hemuttered, after some thought, "that I should let two days elapse, andgive her temper time to evaporate before I go to her." But as he droopedhis head, his eye was attracted by a heap of touch-me-nots, pomegranateblossom and various kinds of fallen flowers, which covered the groundthick as tapestry, and he heaved a sigh. "It's because," he pondered,"she's angry that she did not remove these flowers; but I'll take themover to the place, and by and bye ask her about them."
As he argued to himself, he heard Pao-ch'ai bid them go out. "I'll joinyou in a moment," Pao-yue replied; and waiting till his two cousins hadgone some distance, he bundled the flowers into his coat, and ascendingthe hill, he crossed the stream, penetrated into the arbour, passedthrough the avenues with flowers and wended his way straight for thespot, where he had, on a previous occasion, interred the peach-blossomswith the assistance of Lin Tai-yue. But scarcely had he reached the moundcontaining the flowers, and before he had, as yet, rounded the brow ofthe hill, than he caught, emanating from the off side, the sound of someone sobbing, who while giving way to invective, wept in a mostheart-rending way.
"I wonder," soliloquised Pao-yue, "whose servant-girl this is, who hasbeen so aggrieved as to run over here to have a good cry!"
While speculating within himself, he halted. He then heard, mingled withwails:--
  Flowers wither and decay; and flowers do fleet; they fly all o'er the      skies;  Their bloom wanes; their smell dies; but who is there with them to      sympathise?  While vagrant gossamer soft doth on fluttering spring-bowers bind its      coils,  And drooping catkins lightly strike and cling on the embroidered      screens,  A maiden in the inner rooms, I sore deplore the close of spring.  Such ceaseless sorrow fills my breast, that solace nowhere can I find.  Past the embroidered screen I issue forth, taking with me a hoe,  And on the faded flowers to tread I needs must, as I come and go.  The willow fibres and elm seeds have each a fragrance of their own.  What care I, peach blossoms may fall, pear flowers away be blown;  Yet peach and pear will, when next year returns, burst out again in      bloom,  But can it e'er be told who will next year dwell in the inner room?  What time the third moon comes, the scented nests have been already      built.  And on the beams the swallows perch, excessive spiritless and staid;  Next year, when the flowers bud, they may, it's true, have ample to      feed on:  But they know not that when I'm gone beams will be vacant and nests      fall!  In a whole year, which doth consist of three hundred and sixty days,  Winds sharp as swords and frost like unto spears each other rigorous      press,  So that how long can last their beauty bright; their fresh charm how      long stays?  Sudden they droop and fly; and whither they have flown, 'tis hard to      guess.  Flowers, while in bloom, easy the eye attract; but, when they wither,      hard they are to find.  Now by the footsteps, I bury the flowers, but sorrow will slay me.  Alone I stand, and as I clutch the hoe, silent tears trickle down,  And drip on the bare twigs, leaving behind them the traces of blood.  The goatsucker hath sung his song, the shades lower of eventide,  So with the lotus hoe I return home and shut the double doors.  Upon the wall the green lamp sheds its rays just as I go to sleep.  The cover is yet cold; against the window patters the bleak rain.  How strange! Why can it ever be that I feel so wounded at heart!  Partly, because spring I regret; partly, because with spring I'm      vexed!  Regret for spring, because it sudden comes; vexed, for it sudden goes.  For without warning, lo! it comes; and without asking it doth fleet.  Yesterday night, outside the hall sorrowful songs burst from my mouth,  For I found out that flowers decay, and that birds also pass away.  The soul of flowers, and the spirit of birds are both hard to      restrain.  Birds, to themselves when left, in silence plunge; and flowers, alone,      they blush.  Oh! would that on my sides a pair of wings could grow,  That to the end of heaven I may fly in the wake of flowers!  Yea to the very end of heaven,  Where I could find a fragrant grave!  For better, is it not, that an embroidered bag should hold my      well-shaped bones,  And that a heap of stainless earth should in its folds my winsome      charms enshroud.  For spotless once my frame did come, and spotless again it will go!  Far better than that I, like filthy mire, should sink into some drain!  Ye flowers are now faded and gone, and, lo, I come to bury you.  But as for me, what day I shall see death is not as yet divined!  Here I am fain these flowers to inter; but humankind will laugh me as      a fool.  Who knows, who will, in years to come, commit me to my grave!  Mark, and you'll find the close of spring, and the gradual decay of      flowers,  Resemble faithfully the time of death of maidens ripe in years!  In a twinkle, spring time draws to a close, and maidens wax in age.  Flowers fade and maidens die; and of either nought any more is known.
After listening to these effusions, Pao-yue unconsciously threw himselfdown in a wandering frame of mind.
But, reader, do you feel any interest in him? If you do, the subsequentchapter contains further details about him.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
  Chiang Yue-han lovingly presents a rubia-scented silk sash.  Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai blushingly covers her musk-perfumed string of red      beads.
Lin Tai-yue, the story goes, dwelt, after Ch'ing Wen's refusal, theprevious night, to open the door, under the impression that the blamelay with Pao-yue. The following day, which by another remarkablecoincidence, happened to correspond with the season, when the god offlowers had to be feasted, her total ignorance of the truecircumstances, and her resentment, as yet unspent, aroused again in herdespondent thoughts, suggested by the decline of spring time. Sheconsequently gathered a quantity of faded flowers and fallen petals, andwent and interred them. Unable to check the emotion, caused by the decayof the flowers, she spontaneously recited, after giving way to severalloud lamentations, those verses which Pao-yue, she little thought,overheard from his position on the mound. At first, he did no more thannod his head and heave sighs, full of feeling. But when subsequently hisear caught:
  "Here I am fain these flowers to inter, but humankind will laugh me as      a fool;  Who knows who will, in years to come, commit me to my grave!  In a twinkle springtime draws to an end, and maidens wax in age.  Flowers fade and maidens die; and of either naught any more is known."
he unconsciously was so overpowered with grief that he threw himself onthe mound, bestrewing the whole ground with the fallen flowers hecarried in his coat, close to his chest. "When Tai-yue's flowerlikecharms and moon-like beauty," he reflected, "by and bye likewise reach atime when they will vanish beyond any hope of recovery, won't my heartbe lacerated and my feelings be mangled! And extending, since Tai-yuemust at length some day revert to a state when it will be difficult tofind her, this reasoning to other persons, like Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang Ling,Hsi Jen and the other girls, they too are equally liable to attain astate beyond the reach of human search. But when Pao-ch'ai and all therest have ultimately reached that stage when no trace will be visible ofthem, where shall I myself be then? And when my own human form will havevanished and gone, whither I know not yet, to what person, I wonder,will this place, this garden and these plants, revert?"
From one to a second, and from a second to a third, he thus pursued hisreflections, backwards and forwards, until he really did not know how hecould best, at this time and at such a juncture, dispel his fit ofanguish. His state is adequately described by:
  The shadow of a flower cannot err from the flower itself to the left      or the right.  The song of birds can only penetrate into the ear from the east or the      west.
Lin Tai-yue was herself a prey to emotion and agitation, when unawaressorrowful accents also struck her ear, from the direction of the mound."Every one," she cogitated, "laughs at me for labouring under a foolishmania, but is there likely another fool besides myself?" She then raisedher head, and, casting a glance about her, she discovered that it wasPao-yue. "Ts'ui!" eagerly cried Tai-yue, "I was wondering who it was; butis it truly this ruthless-hearted and short-lived fellow!"
But the moment the two words "short-lived" dropped from her mouth, shesealed her lips; and, heaving a deep sigh, she turned herself round andhurriedly walked off.
Pao-yue, meanwhile, remained for a time a prey to melancholy. Butperceiving that Tai-yue had retired, he at once realised that she musthave caught sight of him and got out of his way; and, as his own companyafforded him no pleasure, he shook the dust off his clothes, rose to hisfeet and descending the hill, he started for the I Hung court by thepath by which he had come. But he espied Tai-yue walking in advance ofhim, and with rapid stride, he overtook her. "Stop a little!" he cried."I know you don't care a rap for me; but I'll just make one singleremark, and from this day forward we'll part company."
Tai-yue looked round. Observing that it was Pao-yue, she was about toignore him; hearing him however mention that he had only one thing tosay, "Please tell me what it is," she forthwith rejoined.
Pao-yue smiled at her. "If I pass two remarks will you listen to me; yesor no?" he asked.
At these words, Tai-yue twisted herself round and beat a retreat. Pao-yuehowever followed behind.
"Since this is what we've come to now," he sighed, "what was the use ofwhat existed between us in days gone by?"
As soon as Tai-yue heard his exclamation, she stopped short impulsively.Turning her face towards him, "what about days gone by," she remarked,"and what about now?"
"Ai!" ejaculated Pao-yue, "when you got here in days gone by, wasn't Iyour playmate in all your romps and in all your fun? My heart may havebeen set upon anything, but if you wanted it you could take it away atonce. I may have been fond of any eatable, but if I came to learn thatyou too fancied it, I there and then put away what could be put away, ina clean place, to wait, Miss, for your return. We had our meals at onetable; we slept in one and the same bed; whatever the servant-girlscould not remember, I reminded them of, for fear lest your temper, Miss,should get ruffled. I flattered myself that cousins, who have grown uptogether from their infancy, as you and I have, would have continued,through intimacy or friendship, either would have done, in peace andharmony until the end, so as to make it palpable that we are above therest. But, contrary to all my expectations, now that you, Miss, havedeveloped in body as well as in mind, you don't take the least heed ofme. You lay hold instead of some cousin Pao or cousin Feng or other fromhere, there and everywhere and give them a place in your affections;while on the contrary you disregard me for three days at a stretch anddecline to see anything of me for four! I have besides no brother orsister of the same mother as myself. It's true there are a couple ofthem, but these, are you not forsooth aware, are by another mother! Youand I are only children, so I ventured to hope that you would havereciprocated my feelings. But, who'd have thought it, I've simply thrownaway this heart of mine, and here I am with plenty of woes to bear, butwith nowhere to go and utter them!"
While expressing these sentiments, tears, unexpectedly, trickled fromhis eyes.
When Lin Tai-yue caught, with her ears, his protestations, and noticedwith her eyes his state of mind, she unconsciously experienced an inwardpang, and, much against her will, tears too besprinkled her cheeks; so,drooping her head, she kept silent.
Her manner did not escape Pao-yue's notice. "I myself am aware," hespeedily resumed, "that I'm worth nothing now; but, however imperfect Imay be, I could on no account presume to become guilty of anyshortcoming with you cousin. Were I to ever commit the slightest fault,your task should be either to tender me advice and warn me not to do itagain, or to blow me up a little, or give me a few whacks; and all thisreproof I wouldn't take amiss. But no one would have ever anticipatedthat you wouldn't bother your head in the least about me, and that youwould be the means of driving me to my wits' ends, and so much out of mymind and off my head, as to be quite at a loss how to act for the best.In fact, were death to come upon me, I would be a spirit driven to mygrave by grievances. However much exalted bonzes and eminent Taoistpriests might do penance, they wouldn't succeed in releasing my soulfrom suffering; for it would still be needful for you to clearly explainthe facts, so that I might at last be able to come to life."
After lending him a patient ear, Tai-yue suddenly banished from hermemory all recollection of the occurrences of the previous night. "Well,in that case," she said, "why did you not let a servant-girl open thedoor when I came over?"
This question took Pao-yue by surprise. "What prompts you to say this?"he exclaimed. "If I have done anything of the kind, may I die at once."
"Psha!" cried Tai-yue, "it's not right that you-should recklessly broachthe subject of living or dying at this early morn! If you say yea, it'syea; and nay, it's nay; what use is there to utter such oaths!"
"I didn't really see you come over," protested Pao-yue. "Cousin Pao-ch'aiit was, who came and sat for a while and then left."
After some reflection, Lin Tai-yue smiled. "Yes," she observed, "yourservant-girls must, I fancy, have been too lazy to budge, grumpy and ina cross-grained mood; this is probable enough."
"This is, I feel sure, the reason," answered Pao-yue, "so when I go back,I'll find out who it was, call them to task and put things right."
"Those girls of yours;" continued Tai-yue, "should be given a lesson, butproperly speaking it isn't for me to mention anything about it. Theirpresent insult to me is a mere trifle; but were to-morrow some Miss Pao(precious) or some Miss Pei (jewel) or other to come, and were she to besubjected to insult, won't it be a grave matter?"
While she taunted him, she pressed her lips, and laughed sarcastically.
Pao-yue heard her remarks and felt both disposed to gnash his teeth withrage, and to treat them as a joke; but in the midst of their colloquy,they perceived a waiting-maid approach and invite them to have theirmeal.
Presently, the whole body of inmates crossed over to the front.
"Miss," inquired Madame Wang at the sight of Tai-yue, "have you taken anyof Dr. Pao's medicines? Do you feel any better?"
"I simply feel so-so," replied Lin Tai-yue, "but grandmother Chiarecommended me to go on taking Dr. Wang's medicines."
"Mother," Pao-yue interposed, "you've no idea that cousin Lin's is aninternal derangement; it's because she was born with a delicate physiquethat she can't stand the slightest cold. All she need do is to take acouple of closes of some decoction to dispel the chill; yet it'spreferable that she should have medicine in pills."
"The other day," said Madame Wang, "the doctor mentioned the name ofsome pills, but I've forgotten what it is."
"I know something about pills," put in Pao-yue; "he merely told her totake some pills or other called 'ginseng as-a-restorative-of-the-system.'"
"That isn't it," Madame Wang demurred.
"The 'Eight-precious-wholesome-to-mother' pills," Pao-yue proceeded, "orthe 'Left-angelica' or 'Right-angelica;' if these also aren't the ones,they must be the 'Eight-flavour Rehmannia-glutinosa' pills."
"None of these," rejoined Madame Wang, "for I remember well that therewere the two words chin kang (guardians in Buddhistic temples)."
"I've never before," observed Pao-yue, clapping his hands, "heard of theexistence of chin kang pills; but in the event of there being any chinkang pills, there must, for a certainty, be such a thing as P'u Sa(Buddha) powder."
At this joke, every one in the whole room burst out laughing. Pao-ch'aicompressed her lips and gave a smile. "It must, I'm inclined to think,"she suggested, "be the 'lord-of-heaven-strengthen-the-heart' pills!"
"Yes, that's the name," Madame Wang laughed, "why, now, I too havebecome muddle-headed."
"You're not muddle-headed, mother," said Pao-yue, "it's the mention ofChin kangs and Buddhas which confused you."
"Stuff and nonsense!" ejaculated Madame Wang. "What you want again isyour father to whip you!"
"My father," Pao-yue laughed, "wouldn't whip me for a thing like this."
"Well, this being their name," resumed Madame Wang, "you had better tellsome one to-morrow to buy you a few."
"All these drugs," expostulated Pao-yue, "are of no earthly use. Wereyou, mother, to give me three hundred and sixty taels, I'll concoct asupply of pills for my cousin, which I can certify will make her feelquite herself again before she has finished a single supply."
"What trash!" cried Madame Wang. "What kind of medicine is there socostly!"
"It's a positive fact," smiled Pao-yue. "This prescription of mine isunlike all others. Besides, the very names of those drugs are quaint,and couldn't be enumerated in a moment; suffice it to mention theplacenta of the first child; three hundred and sixty ginseng roots,shaped like human beings and studded with leaves; four fat tortoises;full-grown polygonum multiflorum; the core of the Pachyma cocos, foundon the roots of a fir tree of a thousand years old; and other suchspecies of medicines. They're not, I admit, out-of-the-way things; butthey are the most excellent among that whole crowd of medicines; andwere I to begin to give you a list of them, why, they'd take you allquite aback. The year before last, I at length let Hsueeh P'an have thisrecipe, after he had made ever so many entreaties during one or twoyears. When, however, he got the prescription, he had to search foranother two or three years and to spend over and above a thousand taelsbefore he succeeded in having it prepared. If you don't believe me,mother, you are at liberty to ask cousin Pao-ch'ai about it."
At the mention of her name, Pao-ch'ai laughingly waved her hand. "I knownothing about it," she observed. "Nor have I heard anything about it, sodon't tell your mother to ask me any questions."
"Really," said Madame Wang smiling, "Pao-ch'ai is a good girl; she doesnot tell lies."
Pao-yue was standing in the centre of the room. Upon hearing these words,he turned round sharply and clapped his hands. "What I stated just now,"he explained, "was the truth; yet you maintain that it was all lies."
As he defended himself, he casually looked round, and caught sight ofLin Tai-yue at the back of Pao-ch'ai laughing with tight-set lips, andapplying her fingers to her face to put him to shame.
But Lady Feng, who had been in the inner rooms overseeing the servantslaying the table, came out at once, as soon as she overheard theconversation. "Brother Pao tells no lies," she smilingly chimed in,"this is really a fact. Some time ago cousin Hsueeh P'an came over inperson and asked me for pearls, and when I inquired of him what hewanted them for, he explained that they were intended to compound somemedicine with; adding, in an aggrieved way, that it would have beenbetter hadn't he taken it in hand for he never had any idea that itwould involve such a lot of trouble! When I questioned him what themedicine was, he returned for answer that it was a prescription ofbrother Pao's; and he mentioned ever so many ingredients, which I don'teven remember. 'Under other circumstances,' he went on to say, 'I wouldhave purchased a few pearls, but what are absolutely wanted are suchpearls as have been worn on the head; and that's why I come to ask you,cousin, for some. If, cousin, you've got no broken ornaments at hand, inthe shape of flowers, why, those that you have on your head will do aswell; and by and bye I'll choose a few good ones and give them to you,to wear.' I had no other course therefore than to snap a couple of twigsfrom some flowers I have, made of pearls, and to let him take them away.One also requires a piece of deep red gauze, three feet in length of thebest quality; and the pearls must be triturated to powder in a mortar."
After each sentence expressed by lady Feng, Pao-yue muttered aninvocation to Buddha. "The thing is as clear as sunlight now," heremarked.
The moment lady Feng had done speaking, Pao-yue put in his word."Mother," he added, "you should know that this is a mere makeshift, forreally, according to the letter of the prescription, these pearls andprecious stones should, properly speaking, consist of such as had beenobtained from, some old grave and been worn as head-ornaments by somewealthy and honourable person of bygone days. But how could one go nowon this account and dig up graves, and open tombs! Hence it is that suchas are simply in use among living persons can equally well besubstituted."
"O-mi-to-fu!" exclaimed Madame Wang, after listening to him throughout."That will never do, and what an arduous job to uselessly saddle one'sself with; for even though there be interred in some graves people,who've been dead for several hundreds of years, it wouldn't be apropitious thing were their corpses turned topsy-turvey now and thebones abstracted; just for the sake of preparing some medicine orother."
Pao-yue thereupon addressed himself to Tai-yue. "Have you heard what wassaid or not?" he asked. "And is there, pray, any likelihood that cousinSecunda would also follow in my lead and tell lies?"
While saying this, his eyes were, albeit his face was turned towards LinTai-yue, fixed upon Pao-ch'ai.
Lin Tai-yue pulled Madame Wang. "You just listen to him, aunt," sheobserved. "All because cousin Pao-ch'ai would not accommodate him bylying, he appeals to me."
"Pao-yue has a great knack," Madame Wang said, "of dealing contemptuouslywith you, his cousin."
"Mother," Pao-yue smilingly protested, "you are not aware how the casestands. When cousin Pao-ch'ai lived at home, she knew nothing whateverabout my elder cousin Hsueeh P'an's affairs, and how much less now thatshe has taken up her quarters inside the garden? She, of course, knowsless than ever about them! Yet, cousin Lin just now stealthily treatedmy statements as lies, and put me to the blush."
These words were still on his lips, when they perceived a waiting-maid,from dowager lady Chia's apartments, come in quest of Pao-yue and LinTai-yue to go and have their meal. Lin Tai-yue, however, did not even callPao-yue, but forthwith rising to her feet, she went along, dragging thewaiting-maid by the hand.
"Let's wait for master Secundus, Mr. Pao, to go along with us," demurredthe girl.
"He doesn't want anything to eat," Lin Tai-yue replied; "he won't comewith us, so I'll go ahead." So saying she promptly left the room.
"I'll have my repast with my mother to-day," Pao-yue said.
"Not at all," Madame Wang remarked, "not at all. I'm going to fastto-day, so it's only right and proper that you should go and have yourown."
"I'll also fast with you then," Pao-yue retorted.
As he spoke, he called out to the servant to go back, and rushing up tothe table, he took a seat.
Madame Wang faced Pao-ch'ai and her companions. "You, girls," sheobserved, "had better have your meal, and let him have his own way!"
"It's only right that you should go," Pao-ch'ai smiled. "Whether youhave anything to eat or not, you should go over for a while to keepcompany to cousin Lin, as she will be quite distressed and out ofspirits."
"Who cares about her!" Pao-yue rejoined, "she'll get all right againafter a time."
Shortly, they finished their repast. But Pao-yue apprehended, in thefirst place, that his grandmother Chia, would be solicitous on hisaccount, and longed, in the second, to be with Lin Tai-yue, so hehurriedly asked for some tea to rinse his mouth with.
"Cousin Secundus," T'an Ch'un and Hsi Ch'un interposed with an ironiclaugh, "what's the use of the hurry-scurry you're in the whole day long!Even when you're having your meals, or your tea, you're in this sort offussy helter-skelter!"
"Make him hurry up and have his tea," Pao-ch'ai chimed in smiling, "sothat he may go and look up his cousin Lin. He'll be up to all kinds ofmischief if you keep him here!"
Pao-yue drank his tea. Then hastily leaving the apartment, he proceededstraightway towards the eastern court. As luck would have it, the momenthe got near lady Feng's court, he descried lady Feng standing at thegateway. While standing on the step, and picking her teeth with anear-cleaner, she superintended about ten young servant-boys removing theflower-pots from place to place. As soon as she caught sight of Pao-yueapproaching, she put on a smiling face. "You come quite opportunely,"she said; "walk in, walk in, and write a few characters for me."
Pao-yue had no option but to follow her in. When they reached theinterior of her rooms, lady Feng gave orders to a servant to fetch apen, inkslab and paper.
"Forty rolls of deep red ornamented satin," she began, addressingherself to Pao-yue, "forty rolls of satin with dragons; a hundred rollsof gauzes of every colour, of the finest quality; four goldnecklaces...."
"What's this?" Pao-yue shouted, "it is neither a bill; nor is it a listof presents, and in what style shall I write it?"
Lady Feng remonstrated with him. "Just you go on writing," she said,"for, in fact, as long as I can make out what it means, it's all that isneeded."
Pao-yue at this response felt constrained to proceed with the writing.
This over lady Feng put the paper by. As she did so, "I've stillsomething more to tell you," she smilingly pursued, "but I wonderwhether you will accede to it or not. There is in your rooms aservant-maid, Hsiao Hung by name, whom I would like to bring over intomy service, and I'll select several girls to-morrow to wait on you; willthis do?"
"The servants in my quarters," answered Pao-yue, "muster a large crowd,so that, cousin, you are at perfect liberty to send for any one of them,who might take your fancy; what's the need therefore of asking me aboutit?"
"If that be so," continued lady Feng laughingly, "I'll tell some one atonce to go and bring her over."
"Yes, she can go and fetch her," acquiesced Pao-yue.
While replying, he made an attempt to take his leave. "Come back,"shouted lady Feng, "I've got something more to tell you."
"Our venerable senior has sent for me," Pao-yue rejoined; "if you haveanything to tell me you must wait till my return."
After this explanation, he there and then came over to his grandmotherChia's on this side, where he found that they had already got throughtheir meal.
"Have you had anything nice to eat with your mother?" old lady Chiaasked.
"There was really nothing nice," Pao-yue smiled. "Yet I managed to have abowl of rice more than usual."
"Where's cousin Lin?" he then inquired.
"She's in the inner rooms," answered his grandmother.
Pao-yue stepped in. He caught sight of a waiting-maid, standing below,blowing into an iron, and two servant-girls seated on the stove-couchmaking a chalk line. Tai-yue with stooping head was cutting out somethingor other with a pair of scissors she held in her hand.
Pao-yue advanced further in. "O! what's this that you are up to!" hesmiled. "You have just had your rice and do you bob your head down inthis way! Why, in a short while you'll be having a headache again!"
Tai-yue, however, did not heed him in the least, but busied herselfcutting out what she had to do.
"The corner of that piece of satin is not yet right," a servant-girl putin. "You had better iron it again!"
Tai-yue threw down the scissors. "Why worry yourself about it?" she said;"it will get quite right after a time."
But while Pao-yue was listening to what was being said, and was inwardlyfeeling in low spirits, he became aware that Pao-ch'ai, T'an Ch'un andthe other girls had also arrived. After a short chat with dowager ladyChia, Pao-ch'ai likewise entered the apartment to find out what hercousin Lin was up to. The moment she espied Lin Tai-yue engaged incutting out something: "You have," she cried, "attained more skill thanever; for there you can even cut out clothes!"
"This too," laughed Tai-yue sarcastically, "is a mere falsehood, tohoodwink people with, nothing more."
"I'll tell you a joke," replied Pao-ch'ai smiling, "when I just now saidthat I did not know anything about that medicine, cousin Pao-yue feltdispleased." "Who cares!" shouted Lin Tai-yue. "He'll get all rightshortly."
"Our worthy grandmother wishes to play at dominoes," Pao-yue thereuponinterposed directing his remarks to Pao-ch'ai; "and there's no one thereat present to have a game with her; so you'd better go and play withher."
"Have I come over now to play dominoes!" promptly smiled Pao-ch'ai whenshe heard his suggestion. With this remark, she nevertheless at oncequitted the room.
"It would be well for you to go," urged Lin Tai-yue, "for there's a tigerin here; and, look out, he might eat you up."
As she spoke, she went on with her cutting.
Pao-yue perceived how both she was to give him any of her attention, andhe had no alternative but to force a smile and to observe: "You shouldalso go for a stroll! It will be time enough by and bye to continue yourcutting."
But Tai-yue would pay no heed whatever to him. Pao-yue addressed himselftherefore to the servant-girls. "Who has taught her how to cut out thesethings?" he asked.
"What does it matter who taught me how to cut?" Tai-yue vehementlyexclaimed, when she realised that he was speaking to the maids. "It's nobusiness of yours, Mr. Secundus."
Pao-yue was then about to say something in his defence when he saw aservant come in and report that there was some one outside who wished tosee him. At this announcement, Pao-yue betook himself with alacrity outof the room.
"O-mi-to-fu!" observed Tai-yue, turning outwards, "it wouldn't matter toyou if you found me dead on your return!"
On his arrival outside, Pao-yue discovered Pei Ming. "You are invited,"he said, "to go to Mr. Feng's house."
Upon hearing this message, Pao-yue knew well enough that it was about theproject mooted the previous day, and accordingly he told him to go andask for his clothes, while he himself wended his steps into the library.
Pei Ming came forthwith to the second gate and waited for some one toappear. Seeing an old woman walk out, Pei Ming went up to her. "OurMaster Secundus, Mr. Pao," he told her, "is in the study waiting for hisout-door clothes; so do go in, worthy dame, and deliver the message."
"It would be better," replied the old woman, "if you did not echo yourmother's absurdities! Our Master Secundus, Mr. Pao, now lives in thegarden, and all the servants, who attend on him, stay in the garden; anddo you again come and bring the message here?"
At these words, Pei Ming smiled. "You're quite right," he rejoined, "inreproving me, for I've become quite idiotic."
So saying, he repaired with quick step to the second gate on the eastside, where, by a lucky hit, the young servant-boys on duty, werekicking marbles on the raised road. Pei Ming explained to them theobject of his coming. A young boy thereupon ran in. After a longinterval, he, at length, made his appearance, holding, enfolded in hisarms, a bundle of clothes, which he handed to Pei Ming, who thenreturned to the library. Pao-yue effected a change in his costume, andgiving directions to saddle his horse, he only took along with him thefour servant-boys, Pei Ming, Chu Lo, Shuang Jui and Shou Erh, andstarted on his way. He reached Feng Tzu-ying's doorway by a short cut. Aservant announced his arrival, and Feng Tzu-ying came out and usheredhim in. Here he discovered Hsueeh P'an, who had already been waiting along time, and several singing-boys besides; as well as Chiang Yue-han,who played female roles, and Yuen Erh, a courtesan in the Chin Hsiangcourt. The whole company exchanged salutations. They next had tea. "Whatyou said the other day," smiled Pao-yue, raising his cup, "about goodfortune coming out of evil fortune has preyed so much upon my mind, bothby day and night, that the moment I received your summons I hurried tocome immediately."
"My worthy cousins," rejoined Feng Tzu-ying smiling. "You're all far toocredulous! It's a mere hoax that I made use of the other day. For somuch did I fear that you would be sure to refuse if I openly asked youto a drinking bout, that I thought it fit to say what I did. But yourattendance to-day, so soon after my invitation, makes it clear, littlethough one would have thought it, that you've all taken it as puregospel truth."
This admission evoked laughter from the whole company. The wines wereafterwards placed on the table, and they took the seats consistent withtheir grades. Feng Tzu-ying first and foremost called the singing-boysand offered them a drink. Next he told Yuen Erh to also approach and havea cup of wine.
By the time, however, that Hsueeh P'an had had his third cup, he of asudden lost control over his feelings, and clasping Yuen Erh's hand inhis: "Do sing me," he smiled, "that novel ballad of your owncomposition; and I'll drink a whole jar full. Eh, will you?"
This appeal compelled Yuen Erh to take up the guitar. She then sang:
  Lovers have I two.  To set aside either I cannot bear.  When my heart longs for thee to come,  It also yearns for him.  Both are in form handsome and fair.  Their beauty to describe it would be hard.  Just think, last night, when at a silent hour, we met in secret, by      the trellis  frame laden with roses white,  One to his feelings stealthily was giving vent,  When lo, the other caught us in the act,  And laying hands on us; there we three stood like litigants before the      bar.  And I had, verily, no word in answer for myself to give.
At the close of her song, she laughed. "Well now," she cried, "down withthat whole jar!"
"Why, it isn't worth a jarful," smiled Hsueeh P'an at these words."Favour us with some other good song!"
"Listen to what I have to suggest," Pao-yue interposed, a smile on hislips. "If you go on drinking in this reckless manner, we will easily getdrunk and there will be no fun in it. I'll take the lead and swallow alarge cupful and put in force a new penalty; and any one of you whodoesn't comply with it, will be mulcted in ten large cupfuls, in quicksuccession!"
Speedily rising from the banquet, he poured the wine for the company.Feng Tzu-ying and the rest meanwhile exclaimed with one voice: "Quiteright! quite right!"
Pao-yue then lifted a large cup and drained it with one draught. "We willnow," he proposed, "dilate on the four characters, 'sad, wounded, gladand joyful.' But while discoursing about young ladies, we'll have toillustrate the four states as well. At the end of this recitation, we'llhave to drink the 'door cup' over the wine, to sing an original andseasonable ballad, while over the heel taps, to make allusion to someobject on the table, and devise something with some old poetical linesor ancient scrolls, from the Four Books or the Five Classics, or withsome set phrases."
Hsueeh P'an gave him no time to finish. He was the first to stand up andprevent him from proceeding. "I won't join you, so don't count me; thisis, in fact, done in order to play tricks upon me."
Yuen Erh, however, also rose to her feet and shoved him down into hisseat.
"What are you in such a funk for?" she laughed. "You're fortunate enoughto be able to drink wine daily, and can't you, forsooth, even come up tome? Yet I mean to recite, by and bye, my own share. If you say what'sright, well and good; if you don't, you will simply have to swallowseveral cups of wine as a forfeit, and is it likely you'll die fromdrunkenness? Are you, pray, going now to disregard this rule and todrink, instead, ten large cups; besides going down to pour the wine?"
One and all clapped in applause. "Well said!" they shouted.
After this, Hueeh P'an had no way out of it and felt compelled to resumehis seat.
They then heard Pao-yue recite:
  A girl is sad,  When her spring-time of life is far advanced and she still occupies a      vacant inner-room.  A girl feels wounded in her heart,  When she regrets having allowed her better half to go abroad and win a      marquisdom.  A girl is glad,  When looking in the mirror, at the time of her morning toilette, she      finds her colour fair.  A girl is joyful,  What time she sits on the frame of a gallows-swing, clad in a thin      spring gown.
Having listened to him, "Capital!" one and all cried out in a chorus.Hsueeh P'an alone raised his face, shook his head and remarked: "It isn'tgood, he must be fined."
"Why should he be fined?" demurred the party.
"Because," retorted Hsueeh P'an, "what he says is entirely unintelligibleto me. So how can he not be fined?"
Yuen Erh gave him a pinch.--"Just you quietly think of yours," shelaughed; "for if by and bye you are not ready you'll also have to bear afine."
In due course Pao-yue took up the guitar. He was heard to sing:
  "When mutual thoughts arise, tears, blood-stained, endless drop, like      lentiles sown broadcast.  In spring, in ceaseless bloom nourish willows and flowers around the      painted tower.  Inside the gauze-lattice peaceful sleep flies, when, after dark, come      wind and rain.  Both new-born sorrows and long-standing griefs cannot from memory ever      die!  E'en jade-fine rice, and gold-like drinks they make hard to go down;      they choke the throat.  The lass has not the heart to desist gazing in the glass at her wan      face.  Nothing can from that knitted brow of hers those frowns dispel;  For hard she finds it patient to abide till the clepsydra will have      run its course.  Alas! how fitly like the faint outline of a green hill which nought      can screen;  Or like a green-tinged stream, which ever ceaseless floweth onward far      and wide!"
When the song drew to an end, his companions with one voice cried out:"Excellent!"
Hsueeh P'an was the only one to find fault. "There's no metre in them,"he said.
Pao-yue quaffed the "opening cup," then seizing a pear, he added:
  "While the rain strikes the pear-blossom I firmly close the door,"
and thus accomplished the requirements of the rule.
Feng Tzu-ying's turn came next.
  "A maid is glad."
he commenced:
  When at her first confinement she gives birth to twins, both sons.  A maid is joyful,  When on the sly she to the garden creeps crickets to catch.  A maid is sad,  When her husband some sickness gets and lies in a bad state.  A maiden is wounded at heart,  When a fierce wind blows down the tower, where she makes her toilette.
Concluding this recitation, he raised the cup and sang:
  "Thou art what one could aptly call a man.  But thou'rt endowed with somewhat too much heart!  How queer thou art, cross-grained and impish shrewd!  A spirit too, thou couldst not be more shrewd.  If all I say thou dost not think is true,  In secret just a minute search pursue;  For then thou'lt know if I love thee or not."
His song over, he drank the "opening cup" and then observed:
  "The cock crows when the moon's rays shine upon the thatched inn."
After his observance of the rule followed Yuen Erh's turn.
  A girl is sad,
Yuen Erh began,
  When she tries to divine on whom she will depend towards the end of      life.
"My dear child!" laughingly exclaimed Hsueeh P'an, "your worthy Mr. Hsueehstill lives, and why do you give way to fears?"
"Don't confuse her!" remonstrated every one of the party, "don't muddleher!"
  "A maiden is wounded at heart."
Yuen Erh proceeded:
  "When her mother beats and scolds her and never for an instant doth       desist."
"It was only the other day," interposed Hsueeh P'an, "that I saw yourmother and that I told her that I would not have her beat you."
"If you still go on babbling," put in the company with one consent,"you'll be fined ten cups."
Hsueeh P'an promptly administered himself a slap on the mouth. "How youlack the faculty of hearing!" he exclaimed. "You are not to say a wordmore!"
  "A girl is glad,"
Yuen Erh then resumed:
  When her lover cannot brook to leave her and return home.  A maiden is joyful,  When hushing the pan-pipe and double pipe, a stringed instrument she      thrums.
At the end of her effusion, she at once began to sing:
  "T'is the third day of the third moon, the nutmegs bloom;  A maggot, lo, works hard to pierce into a flower;  But though it ceaseless bores it cannot penetrate.  So crouching on the buds, it swing-like rocks itself.  My precious pet, my own dear little darling,  If I don't choose to open how can you steal in?"
Finishing her song, she drank the "opening cup," after which she added:"the delicate peach-blossom," and thus complied with the exigencies ofthe rule.
Next came Hsueeh P'an. "Is it for me to speak now?" Hsueeh P'an asked.
  "A maiden is sad..."
But a long time elapsed after these words were uttered and yet nothingfurther was heard.
"Sad for what?" Feng Tzu-ying laughingly asked. "Go on and tell us atonce!"
Hsueeh P'an was much perplexed. His eyes rolled about like a bell.
  "A girl is sad..."
he hastily repeated. But here again he coughed twice before heproceeded.
  "A girl is sad."
he said:
  "When she marries a spouse who is a libertine."
This sentence so tickled the fancy of the company that they burst outinto a loud fit of laughter.
"What amuses you so?" shouted Hsueeh P'an, "is it likely that what I sayis not correct? If a girl marries a man, who chooses to forget allvirtue, how can she not feel sore at heart?"
But so heartily did they all laugh that their bodies were bent in two."What you say is quite right," they eagerly replied. "So proceed at oncewith the rest."
Hsueeh P'an thereupon stared with vacant gaze.
  "A girl is grieved...."
he added:
But after these few words he once more could find nothing to say.
"What is she grieved about?" they asked.
  "When a huge monkey finds its way into the inner room."
Hsueeh P'an retorted.
This reply set every one laughing. "He must be mulcted," they cried, "hemust be mulcted. The first one could anyhow be overlooked; but this lineis more unintelligible."
As they said this, they were about to pour the wine, when Pao-yuesmilingly interfered. "The rhyme is all right," he observed.
"The master of the rules," Hsueeh P'an remarked, "approves it in everyway, so what are you people fussing about?"
Hearing this, the company eventually let the matter drop.
"The two lines, that follow, are still more difficult," suggested YuenErh with a smile, "so you had better let me recite for you."
"Fiddlesticks!" exclaimed Hsueeh P'an, "do you really fancy that I haveno good ones! Just you listen to what I shall say.
 "A girl is glad,  When in the bridal room she lies, with flowery candles burning, and      she is loth to rise at morn."
This sentiment filled one and all with amazement. "How supremelyexcellent this line is!" they ejaculated.
  "A girl is joyful,"
Hsueeh P'an resumed,
  "During the consummation of wedlock."
Upon catching this remark, the party turned their heads away, andshouted: "Dreadful! Dreadful! But quick sing your song and have done."
Forthwith Hsueeh P'an sang:
  "A mosquito buzzes heng, heng, heng!"
Every one was taken by surprise. "What kind of song is this?" theyinquired.
But Hsueeh P'an went on singing:
  "Two flies buzz weng, weng, weng."
"Enough," shouted his companions, "that will do, that will do!"
"Do you want to hear it or not?" asked Hsueeh P'an, "this is a new kindof song, called the 'Heng, heng air,' but if you people are not disposedto listen, let me off also from saying what I have to say over theheel-taps and I won't then sing."
"We'll let you off! We'll let you off," answered one and all, "so don'tbe hindering others."
  "A maiden is sad,"
Chiang Yue-han at once began,
  When her husband leaves home and never does return.  A maiden is disconsolate,  When she has no money to go and buy some _olea frangrans_ oil.  A maiden is glad,  When the wick of the lantern forms two heads like twin flowers on one      stem.  A maiden is joyful,  When true conjugal peace prevails between her and her mate.
His recital over, he went on to sing:
  "How I love thee with those seductive charms of thine, heaven-born!  In truth thou'rt like a living fairy from the azure skies!  The spring of life we now enjoy; we are yet young in years.  Our union is, indeed, a happy match!  But. lo! the milky way doth at its zenith soar;  Hark to the drums which beat around in the watch towers;  So raise the silver lamp and let us soft under the nuptial curtain      steal."
Finishing the song, he drank the "opening cup." "I know," he smiled,"few poetical quotations bearing on this sort of thing. By a stroke ofgood fortune, however, I yesterday conned a pair of antitheticalscrolls; of these I can only remember just one line, but lucky enoughfor me the object it refers to figures as well on this festive board."
This said he forthwith drained the wine, and, picking up a bud of adiminutive variety of _olea fragrans_, he recited:
  "When the perfume of flowers wafts (hsi jen) itself into a man, he      knows the day is warm."
The company unanimously conceded that the rule had been adhered to. ButHsueeh P'an once again jumped up. "It's awful, awful!" he bawled outboisterously; "he should be fined, he should be made to pay a forfeit;there's no precious article whatever on this table; how is it then thatyou introduce precious things?"
"There was nothing about precious things!" Chiang Yue-han vehementlyexplained.
"What I are you still prevaricating?" Hsueeh P'an cried, "Well, repeat itagain!"
Chiang Yue-han had no other course but to recite the line a second time."Now is not Hsi Jen a precious thing?" Hsueeh P'an asked. "If she isn't,what is she? And if you don't believe me, you ask him about it,"pointing, at the conclusion of this remark, at Pao-yue.
Pao-yue felt very uncomfortable. Rising to his feet, "Cousin," heobserved, "you should be fined heavily."
"I should be! I should be!" Hsueeh P'an shouted, and saying this, he tookup the wine and poured it down his throat with one gulp.
Feng Tzu-ying, Chiang Yue-han and their companions thereupon asked him toexplain the allusion. Yuen Erh readily told them, and Chiang Yue-hanhastily got up and pleaded guilty.
"Ignorance," the party said with one consent, "does not amount toguilt."
But presently Pao-yue quitted the banquet to go and satisfy a naturalwant and Chiang Yue-han followed him out. The two young fellows haltedunder the eaves of the verandah, and Chiang Yue-han then recommenced tomake ample apologies. Pao-yue, however, was so attracted by his handsomeand genial appearance, that he took quite a violent fancy to him; andsqueezing his hand in a firm grip. "If you have nothing to do," heurged, "do let us go over to our place. I've got something more to askyou. It's this, there's in your worthy company some one called Ch'iKuan, with a reputation extending at present throughout the world; but,unfortunately, I alone have not had the good luck of seeing him evenonce."
"This is really," rejoined Chiang Yue-han with a smile, "my own infantname."
This disclosure at once made Pao-yue quite exuberant, and stamping hisfeet he smiled. "How lucky! I'm in luck's way!" he exclaimed. "In verytruth your reputation is no idle report. But to-day is our firstmeeting, and what shall I do?"
After some thought, he produced a fan from his sleeve, and, unlooseningone of the jade pendants, he handed it to Ch'i Kuan. "This is a meretrifle," he said. "It does not deserve your acceptance, yet it will be asmall souvenir of our acquaintance to-day."
Ch'i Kuan received it with a smile. "I do not deserve," he replied,"such a present. How am I worthy of such an honour! But never mind, I'vealso got about me here a strange thing, which I put on this morning; itis brand-new yet, and will, I hope, suffice to prove to you a little ofthe feeling of esteem which I entertain for you."
With these protestations, he raised his garment, and, untying a deep redsash, with which his nether clothes were fastened, he presented it toPao-yue. "This sash," he remarked, "is an article brought as tribute fromthe Queen of the Hsi Hsiang Kingdom. If you attach this round you insummer, your person will emit a fragrant perfume, and it will notperspire. It was given to me yesterday by the Prince of Pei Ching, andit is only to-day that I put it on. To any one else, I would certainlynot be willing to present it. But, Mr. Secundus, please do unfasten theone you have on and give it to me to bind round me."
This proposal extremely delighted Pao-yue. With precipitate haste, heaccepted his gift, and, undoing the dark brown sash he wore, hesurrendered it to Ch'i Kuan. But both had just had time to adjust theirrespective sashes when they heard a loud voice say: "Oh! I've caughtyou!" And they perceived Hsueeh P'an come out by leaps and bounds.Clutching the two young fellows, "What do you," he exclaimed, "leaveyour wine for and withdraw from the banquet. Be quick and produce thosethings, and let me see them!"
"There's nothing to see!" rejoined the two young fellows with one voice.
Hsueeh P'an, however, would by no means fall in with their views. And itwas only Feng Tzu-ying, who made his appearance on the scene, whosucceeded in dissuading him. So resuming their seats, they drank untildark, when the company broke up.
Pao-yue, on his return into the garden, loosened his clothes, and hadtea. But Hsi Jen noticed that the pendant had disappeared from his fanand she inquired of him what had become of it.
"I must have lost it this very moment," Pao-yue replied.
At bedtime, however, descrying a deep red sash, with spots like specksof blood, attached round his waist, Hsi Jen guessed more or less thetruth of what must have transpired. "As you have such a nice sash tofasten your trousers with," Hsi Jen consequently said, "you'd betterreturn that one of mine."
This reminder made the fact dawn upon Pao-yue that the sash hadoriginally been the property of Hsi Jen, and that he should by rightsnot have parted with it; but however much he felt his conscience smittenby remorse, he failed to see how he could very well disclose the truthto her. He could therefore only put on a smiling expression and add,"I'll give you another one instead."
Hsi Jen was prompted by his rejoinder to nod her head and sigh. "I feltsure;" she observed; "that you'd go again and do these things! Yet youshouldn't take my belongings and bestow them on that low-bred sort ofpeople. Can it be that no consideration finds a place in your heart?"
She then felt disposed to tender him a few more words of admonition, butdreading, on the other hand, lest she should, by irritating him, bringthe fumes of the wine to his head, she thought it best to also retire tobed.
Nothing worth noticing occurred during that night. The next day, whenshe woke up at the break of day, she heard Pao-yue call out laughingly:"Robbers have been here in the night; are you not aware of it? Just youlook at my trousers."
Hsi Jen lowered her head and looked. She saw at a glance that the sash,which Pao-yue had worn the previous day, was bound round her own waist,and she at once realised that Pao-yue must have effected the changeduring the night; but promptly unbinding it, "I don't care for suchthings!" she cried, "quick, take it away!"
At the sight of her manner, Pao-yue had to coax her with gentle terms.This so disarmed Hsi Jen, that she felt under the necessity of puttingon the sash; but, subsequently when Pao-yue stepped out of the apartment,she at last pulled it off, and, throwing it away in an empty box, shefound one of hers and fastened it round her waist.
Pao-yue, however, did not in the least notice what she did, but inquiredwhether anything had happened the day before.
"Lady Secunda," Hsi Jen explained, "dispatched some one and fetchedHsiao Hung away. Her wish was to have waited for your return; but as Ithought that it was of no consequence, I took upon myself to decide, andsent her off."
"That's all right!" rejoined Pao-yue. "I knew all about it, there was noneed for her to wait."
"Yesterday," resumed Hsi Jen, "the Imperial Consort deputed the EunuchHsia to bring a hundred and twenty ounces of silver and to convey hercommands that from the first to the third, there should be offered, inthe Ch'ing Hsu temple, thanksgiving services to last for three days andthat theatrical performances should be given, and oblations presented:and to tell our senior master, Mr. Chia Chen, to take all the gentlemen,and go and burn incense and worship Buddha. Besides this, she also sentpresents for the dragon festival."
Continuing, she bade a young servant-maid produce the presents, whichhad been received the previous day. Then he saw two palace fans of thebest quality, two strings of musk-scented beads, two rolls of silk, asfine as the phoenix tail, and a superior mat worked with hibiscus. Atthe sight of these things, Pao-yue was filled with immeasurablepleasure, and he asked whether the articles brought to all the otherswere similar to his.
"The only things in excess of yours that our venerable mistress has,"Hsi Jen explained, "consist of a scented jade sceptre and a pillow madeof agate. Those of your worthy father and mother, our master andmistress, and of your aunt exceed yours by a scented sceptre of jade.Yours are the same as Miss Pao's. Miss Lin's are like those of MissesSecunda, Tertia and Quarta, who received nothing beyond a fan andseveral pearls and none of all the other things. As for our senior lady,Mrs. Chia Chu, and lady Secunda, these two got each two rolls of gauze,two rolls of silk, two scented bags, and two sticks of medicine."
After listening to her enumeration, "What's the reason of this?" hesmiled. "How is it that Miss Lin's are not the same as mine, but thatMiss Pao's instead are like my own? May not the message have beenwrongly delivered?"
"When they were brought out of the palace yesterday," Hsi Jen rejoined,"they were already divided in respective shares, and slips were alsoplaced on them, so that how could any mistake have been made? Yours wereamong those for our dowager lady's apartments. When I went and fetchedthem, her venerable ladyship said that I should tell you to go thereto-morrow at the fifth watch to return thanks.
"Of course, it's my duty to go over," Pao-yue cried at these words, butforthwith calling Tzu Chuean: "Take these to your Miss Lin," he told her,"and say that I got them, yesterday, and that she is at liberty to keepout of them any that take her fancy."
Tzu Chuean expressed her obedience and took the things away. After ashort time she returned. "Miss Lin says," she explained, "that she alsogot some yesterday, and that you, Master Secundus, should keep yours."
Hearing this reply, Pao-yue quickly directed a servant to put them away.But when he had washed his face and stepped out of doors, bent upongoing to his grandmother's on the other side, in order to pay hisobeisance, he caught sight of Lin Tai-yue coming along towards him, fromthe opposite direction. Pao-yue hurriedly walked up to her, "I told you,"he smiled, "to select those you liked from my things; how is it youdidn't choose any?"
Lin Tai-yue had long before banished from her recollection the incidentof the previous day, which had made her angry with Pao-yue, and was onlyexercised about the occurrence of this present occasion. "I'm not giftedwith such extreme good fortune," she consequently answered, "as to beable to accept them. I can't compete with Miss Pao, in connection withwhom something or other about gold or about jade is mentioned. We aresimply beings connected with the vegetable kingdom."
The allusion to the two words "gold and jade," aroused, of a sudden,much emotion in the heart of Pao-yue. "If beyond what people say aboutgold or jade," he protested, "the idea of any such things ever crossesmy mind, may the heavens annihilate me, and may the earth extinguish me,and may I for ten thousand generations never assume human form!"
These protestations convinced Lin Tai-yue that suspicion had been arousedin him. With all promptitude, she smiled and observed, "They're all tono use! Why utter such oaths, when there's no rhyme or reason! Who caresabout any gold or any jade of yours!"
"It would be difficult for me to tell you, to your face, all the secretsof my heart," Pao-yue resumed, "but by and bye you'll surely come to knowall about them! After the three--my old grandmother, my father and mymother--you, my cousin, hold the fourth place; and, if there be afifth, I'm ready to swear another oath."
"You needn't swear any more," Lin Tai-yue replied, "I'm well aware thatI, your younger cousin, have a place in your heart; but the thing isthat at the sight of your elder cousin, you at once forget all aboutyour younger cousin."
"This comes again from over-suspicion!" ejaculated Pao; "for I'm not atall disposed that way."
"Well," resumed Lin Tai-yue, "why did you yesterday appeal to me whenthat hussey Pao-ch'ai would not help you by telling a story? Had it beenI, who had been guilty of any such thing, I don't know what you wouldn'thave done again."
But during their _tete-a-tete_, they espied Pao-ch'ai approach fromthe opposite direction, so readily they beat a retreat. Pao-ch'ai haddistinctly caught sight of them, but pretending she had not seen them,she trudged on her way, with lowered head, and repaired into MadameWang's apartments. After a short stay, she came to this side to paydowager lady Chia a visit. With her she also found Pao-yue.
Pao-ch'ai ever made it a point to hold Pao-yue aloof as her mother had indays gone by mentioned to Madame Wang and her other relatives that thegold locket had been the gift of a bonze, that she had to wait untilsuch time as some suitor with jade turned up before she could be givenin marriage, and other similar confidences. But on discovery theprevious day that Yuean Ch'un's presents to her alone resembled those ofPao-yue, she began to feel all the more embarrassed. Luckily, however,Pao-yue was so entangled in Lin Tai-yue's meshes and so absorbed in heartand mind with fond thoughts of his Lin Tai-yue that he did not pay theleast attention to this circumstance. But she unawares now heard Pao-yueremark with a smile: "Cousin Pao, let me see that string of scentedbeads of yours!"
By a strange coincidence, Pao-ch'ai wore the string of beads round herleft wrist so she had no alternative, when Pao-yue asked her for it, thanto take it off. Pao-ch'ai, however, was naturally inclined toembonpoint, and it proved therefore no easy matter for her to get thebeads off; and while Pao-yue stood by watching her snow-white arm,feelings of admiration were quickly stirred up in his heart. "Were thisarm attached to Miss Lin's person," he secretly pondered, "I might,possibly have been able to caress it! But it is, as it happens, part andparcel of her body; how I really do deplore this lack of good fortune."
Suddenly he bethought himself of the secret of gold and jade, and heagain scanned Pao-ch'ai's appearance. At the sight of her countenance,resembling a silver bowl, her eyes limpid like water and almond-like inshape, her lips crimson, though not rouged, her eyebrows jet-black,though not pencilled, also of that fascination and grace which presentedsuch a contrast to Lin Tai-yue's style of beauty, he could not refrainfrom falling into such a stupid reverie, that though Pao-ch'ai had gotthe string of beads off her wrist, and was handing them to him, heforgot all about them and made no effort to take them. Pao-ch'airealised that he was plunged in abstraction, and conscious of theawkward position in which she was placed, she put down the string ofbeads, and turning round was on the point of betaking herself away, whenshe perceived Lin Tai-yue, standing on the door-step, laughingsignificantly while biting a handkerchief she held in her mouth. "Youcan't resist," Pao-ch'ai said, "a single puff of wind; and why do youstand there and expose yourself to the very teeth of it?"
"Wasn't I inside the room?" rejoined Lin Tai-yue, with a cynical smile."But I came out to have a look as I heard a shriek in the heavens; itturned out, in fact, to be a stupid wild goose!"
"A stupid wild goose!" repeated Pao-ch'ai. "Where is it, let me also seeit!"
"As soon as I got out," answered Lin Tai-yue, "it flew away with a't'e-rh' sort of noise."
While replying, she threw the handkerchief, she was holding, straightinto Pao-yue's face. Pao-yue was quite taken by surprise. He was hit onthe eye. "Ai-yah!" he exclaimed.
But, reader, do you want to hear the sequel? In that case, listen to thecircumstances, which will be disclosed in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XXIX.
  A happy man enjoys a full measure of happiness, but still prays for      happiness.  A beloved girl is very much loved, but yet craves for more love.
Pao-yue, so our story runs, was gazing vacantly, when Tai-yue, at a momentleast expected, flung her handkerchief at him, which just hit him on theeyes, and frightened him out of his wits. "Who was it?" he cried.
Lin Tai-yue nodded her head and smiled. "I would not venture to do such athing," she said, "it was a mere slip of my hand. As cousin Pao-ch'aiwished to see the silly wild goose, I was pointing it out to her, whenthe handkerchief inadvertently flew out of my grip."
Pao-yue kept on rubbing his eyes. The idea suggested itself to him tomake some remonstrance, but he could not again very well open his lips.
Presently, lady Feng arrived. She then alluded, in the course ofconversation, to the thanksgiving service, which was to be offered onthe first, in the Ch'ing Hsue temple, and invited Pao-ch'ai, Pao-yue,Tai-yue and the other inmates with them to be present at the theatricals.
"Never mind," smiled Pao-ch'ai, "it's too hot; besides, what playshaven't I seen? I don't mean to come."
"It's cool enough over at their place," answered lady Feng. "There arealso two-storied buildings on either side; so we must all go! I'll sendservants a few days before to drive all that herd of Taoist priests out,to sweep the upper stories, hang up curtains, and to keep out everysingle loafer from the interior of the temple; so it will be all rightlike that. I've already told our Madame Wang that if you people don'tgo, I mean to go all alone, as I've been again in very low spirits theselast few days, and as when theatricals come off at home, it's out of thequestion for me to look on with any peace and quiet."
When dowager lady Chia heard what she said, she smiled. "Well, in thatcase," she remarked, "I'll go along with you."
Lady Feng, at these words, gave a smile. "Venerable ancestor," shereplied, "were you also to go, it would be ever so much better; yet Iwon't feel quite at my ease!"
"To-morrow," dowager lady Chia continued, "I can stay in the two-storiedbuilding, situated on the principal site, while you can go to the one onthe side. You can then likewise dispense with coming over to where Ishall be to stand on any ceremonies. Will this suit you or not?"
"This is indeed," lady Feng smiled, "a proof of your regard for me, myworthy senior."
Old lady Chia at this stage faced Pao-ch'ai. "You too should go," shesaid, "so should your mother; for if you remain the whole day long athome, you will again sleep your head off."
Pao-ch'ai felt constrained to signify her assent. Dowager lady Chia thenalso despatched domestics to invite Mrs. Hsueeh; and, on their way, theynotified Madame Wang that she was to take the young ladies along withher. But Madame Wang felt, in the first place, in a poor state ofhealth, and was, in the second, engaged in making preparations for thereception of any arrivals from Yuean Ch'un, so that she, at an earlyhour, sent word that it was impossible for her to leave the house. Yetwhen she received old lady Chia's behest, she smiled and exclaimed: "Areher spirits still so buoyant!" and transmitted the message into thegarden that any, who had any wish to avail themselves of theopportunity, were at liberty to go on the first, with their venerablesenior as their chaperonne. As soon as these tidings were spread abroad,every one else was indifferent as to whether they went or not; but ofthose girls who, day after day, never put their foot outside thedoorstep, which of them was not keen upon going, the moment they heardthe permission conceded to them? Even if any of their respectivemistresses were too lazy to move, they employed every expedient toinduce them to go. Hence it was that Li Kung-ts'ai and the other inmatessignified their unanimous intention to be present. Dowager lady Chia, atthis, grew more exultant than ever, and she issued immediate directionsfor servants to go and sweep and put things in proper order. But to allthese preparations, there is no necessity of making detailed reference;sufficient to relate that on the first day of the moon, carriages stoodin a thick maze, and men and horses in close concourse, at the entranceof the Jung Kuo mansion.
When the servants, the various managers and other domestics came tolearn that the Imperial Consort was to perform good deeds and thatdowager lady Chia was to go in person and offer incense, they arranged,as it happened that the first of the moon, which was the principal dayof the ceremonies, was, in addition, the season of the dragon-boatfestival, all the necessary articles in perfect readiness and withunusual splendour. Shortly, old lady Chia and the other inmates startedon their way. The old lady sat in an official chair, carried by eightbearers: widow Li, lady Feng and Mrs. Hsueeh, each in a four-bearerchair. Pao-ch'ai and Tai-yue mounted together a curricle with green coverand pearl tassels, bearing the eight precious things. The three sisters,Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un got in a carriage with red wheelsand ornamented hood. Next in order, followed dowager lady Chia'swaiting-maids, Yuean Yang, Ying Wu, Hu Po, Chen Chu; Lin Tai-yue'swaiting-maids Tzu Chuean, Hsueeh Yen, and Ch'un Ch'ien; Pao-ch'ai'swaiting-maids Ying Erh and Wen Hsing; Ying Ch'un's servant-girls SsuCh'i and Hsiu Chue; T'an Ch'un's waiting-maids Shih Shu and Ts'ui Mo; HsiCh'un's servant-girls Ju Hua and Ts'ai P'ing; and Mrs. Hsueeh'swaiting-maids T'ung Hsi, and T'ung Kuei. Besides these, were joined totheir retinue: Hsiang Ling and Hsiang Ling's servant-girl Ch'in Erh;Mrs. Li's waiting-maids Su Yuen and Pi Yueeh; lady Feng's servant-girlsP'ing Erh, Feng Erh and Hsiao Hung, as well as Madame Wang's twowaiting-maids Chin Ch'uan and Ts'ai Yuen. Along with lady Feng, came anurse carrying Ta Chieh Erh. She drove in a separate carriage, togetherwith a couple of servant-girls. Added also to the number of the suitewere matrons and nurses, attached to the various establishments, and thewives of the servants of the household, who were in attendance out ofdoors. Their carriages, forming one black solid mass, therefore, crammedthe whole extent of the street.
Dowager lady Chia and other members of the party had already proceeded aconsiderable distance in their chairs, and yet the inmates at the gatehad not finished mounting their vehicles. This one shouted: "I won't sitwith you." That one cried: "You've crushed our mistress' bundle." In thecarriages yonder, one screamed: "You've pulled my flowers off." Anotherone nearer exclaimed: "You've broken my fan." And they chatted andchatted, and talked and laughed with such incessant volubility, thatChou Jui's wife had to go backward and forward calling them to task."Girls," she said, "this is the street. The on-lookers will laugh atyou!" But it was only after she had expostulated with them several timesthat any sign of improvement became at last visible.
The van of the procession had long ago reached the entrance of theCh'ing Hsue Temple. Pao-yue rode on horseback. He preceded the chairoccupied by his grandmother Chia. The throngs that filled the streetsranged themselves on either side.
On their arrival at the temple, the sound of bells and the rattle ofdrums struck their ear. Forthwith appeared the head-bonze Chang, a stickof incense in hand; his cloak thrown over his shoulders. He took hisstand by the wayside at the head of a company of Taoist priests topresent his greetings. The moment dowager lady Chia reached, in herchair, the interior of the main gate, she descried the lares andpenates, the lord presiding over that particular district, and the clayimages of the various gods, and she at once gave orders to halt. ChiaChen advanced to receive her acting as leader to the male members of thefamily. Lady Feng was well aware that Yuean Yang and the other attendantswere at the back and could not overtake their old mistress, so sheherself alighted from her chair to volunteer her services. She was aboutto hastily press forward and support her, when, by a strange accident, ayoung Taoist neophyte, of twelve or thirteen years of age, who held acase containing scissors, with which he had been snuffing the candlesburning in the various places, just seized the opportunity to run outand hide himself, when he unawares rushed, head foremost, into ladyFeng's arms. Lady Feng speedily raised her hand and gave him such a slapon the face that she made the young fellow reel over and perform asomersault. "You boorish young bastard!" she shouted, "where are yourunning to?"
The young Taoist did not even give a thought to picking up the scissors,but crawling up on to his feet again, he tried to scamper outside. Butjust at that very moment Pao-ch'ai and the rest of the young ladies weredismounting from their vehicles, and the matrons and women-servants wereclosing them in so thoroughly on all sides that not a puff of wind or adrop of rain could penetrate, and when they perceived a Taoist neophytecome rushing headlong out of the place, they, with one voice, exclaimed:"Catch him, catch him! Beat him, beat him!"
Old lady Chia overheard their cries. She asked with alacrity what thefuss was all about. Chia Chen immediately stepped outside to makeinquiries. Lady Feng then advanced and, propping up her old senior, shewent on to explain to her that a young Taoist priest, whose duties wereto snuff the candles, had not previously retired out of the compound,and that he was now endeavouring to recklessly force his way out."
"Be quick and bring the lad here," shouted dowager lady Chia, as soon asshe heard her explanation, "but, mind, don't frighten him. Children ofmean families invariably get into the way of being spoilt byover-indulgence. How ever could he have set eyes before upon suchdisplay as this! Were you to frighten him, he will really be much to bepitied; and won't his father and mother be exceedingly cut up?"
As she spoke, she asked Chia Chen to go and do his best to bring himround. Chia Chen felt under the necessity of going, and he managed todrag the lad into her presence. With the scissors still clasped in hishand, the lad fell on his knees, and trembled violently.
Dowager lady Chia bade Chia Chen raise him up. "There's nothing tofear!" she said reassuringly. Then she asked him how old he was.
The boy, however, could on no account give vent to speech.
"Poor boy!" once more exclaimed the old lady. And continuing: "BrotherChen," she added, addressing herself to Chia Chen, "take him away, andgive him a few cash to buy himself fruit with; and do impress upon everyone that they are not to bully him."
Chia Chen signified his assent and led him off.
During this time, old lady Chia, taking along with her the whole familyparty, paid her devotions in storey after storey, and visited everyplace.
The young pages, who stood outside, watched their old mistress and theother inmates enter the second row of gates. But of a sudden they espiedChia Chen wend his way outwards, leading a young Taoist priest, andcalling the servants to come, say; "Take him and give him severalhundreds of cash and abstain from ill-treating him." At these orders,the domestics approached with hurried step and led him off.
Chia Chen then inquired from the terrace-steps where the majordomo was.At this inquiry, the pages standing below, called out in chorus,"Majordomo!"
Lin Chih-hsiao ran over at once, while adjusting his hat with one hand,and appeared in the presence of Chia Chen.
"Albeit this is a spacious place," Chia Chen began, "we muster a goodconcourse to-day, so you'd better bring into this court those servants,who'll be of any use to you, and send over into that one those whowon't. And choose a few from among those young pages to remain on duty,at the second gate and at the two side entrances, so as to ask forthings and deliver messages. Do you understand me, yes or no? The youngladies and ladies have all come out of town to-day, and not a singleoutsider must be permitted to put his foot in here."
"I understand," replied Lin Chih-hsiao hurriedly signifying hisobedience. Next he uttered several yes's.
"Now," proceeded Chia Chen; "you can go on your way. But how is it, Idon't see anything of Jung Erh?" he went on to ask.
This question was barely out of his lips, when he caught sight of JungErh running out of the belfry. "Look at him," shouted Chia Chen. "Lookat him! I don't feel hot in here, and yet he must go in search of a coolplace. Spit at him!" he cried to the family servants.
The young pages were fully aware that Chia Chen's ordinary dispositionwas such that he could not brook contradiction, and one of the ladsspeedily came forward and sputtered in Chia Jung's face. But Chia Chenstill kept his gaze fixed on him, so the young page had to inquire ofChia Jung: "Master doesn't feel hot here, and how is it that you, Sir,have been the first to go and get cool?"
Chia Jung however dropped his arms, and did not venture to utter asingle sound. Chia Yuen, Chia P'ing, Chia Ch'in and the other youngpeople overheard what was going on and not only were they scared out oftheir wits, but even Chia Lien, Chia Pin, Chia Ch'ung and theircompanions were stricken with intense fright and one by one they quietlyslipped down along the foot of the wall.
"What are you standing there for?" Chia Chen shouted to Chia Jung."Don't you yet get on your horse and gallop home and tell your motherthat our venerable senior is here with all the young ladies, and bidthem come at once and wait upon them?"
As soon as Chia Jung heard these words, he ran out with hurried strideand called out repeatedly for his horse. Now he felt resentment, arguingwithin himself: "Who knows what he has been up to the whole morning,that he now finds fault with me!" Now he went on to abuse the youngservants, crying: "Are your hands made fast, that you can't lead thehorse round?" And he felt inclined to bid a servant-boy go on theerrand, but fearing again lest he should subsequently be found out, andbe at a loss how to account for his conduct he felt compelled to proceedin person; so mounting his steed, he started on his way.
But to return to Chia Chen. Just as he was about to be take himselfinside, he noticed the Taoist Chang, who stood next to him, force asmile. "I'm not properly speaking," he remarked, "on the same footing asthe others and should be in attendance inside, but as on account of theintense heat, the young ladies have come out of doors, I couldn'tpresume to take upon myself to intrude and ask what your orders, Sir,are. But the dowager lady may possibly inquire about me, or may like tovisit any part of the temple, so I shall wait in here."
Chia Chen was fully cognisant that this Taoist priest, Chang, had, it istrue, in past days, stood as a substitute for the Duke of the Jung Kuomansion, but that the former Emperor had, with his own lips, conferredupon him the appellation of the 'Immortal being of the Great Unreal,'that he held at present the seal of 'Taoist Superior,' that the reigningEmperor had raised him to the rank of the 'Pure man,' that the princes,now-a-days, dukes, and high officials styled him the "Supernaturalbeing," and he did not therefore venture to treat him with anydisrespect. In the second place, (he knew that) he had paid frequentvisits to the mansions, and that he had made the acquaintance of theladies and young ladies, so when he heard his present remark hesmilingly rejoined. "Do you again make use of such language amongstourselves? One word more, and I'll take that beard of yours, and outrootit! Don't you yet come along with me inside?"
"Hah, hah," laughed the Taoist Chang aloud, as he followed Chia Chen in.Chia Chen approached dowager lady Chia. Bending his body he strained alaugh. "Grandfather Chang," he said, "has come in to pay his respects."
"Raise him up!" old lady Chia vehemently called out.
Chia Chen lost no time in pulling him to his feet and bringing him over.
The Taoist Chang first indulged in loud laughter. "Oh Buddha ofunlimited years!" he then observed. "Have you kept all right and in goodhealth, throughout, venerable Senior? Have all the ladies and youngladies continued well? I haven't been for some time to your mansion topay my obeisance, but you, my dowager lady, have improved more andmore."
"Venerable Immortal Being!" smiled old lady Chia, "how are you; quitewell?"
"Thanks to the ten thousand blessings he has enjoyed from your hands,"rejoined Chang the Taoist, "your servant too continues pretty strong andhale. In every other respect, I've, after all, been all right; but Ihave felt much concern about Mr. Pao-yue. Has he been all right all thetime? The other day, on the 26th of the fourth moon, I celebrated thebirthday of the 'Heaven-Pervading-Mighty-King;' few people came andeverything went off right and proper. I told them to invite Mr. Pao tocome for a stroll; but how was it they said that he wasn't at home?"
"It was indeed true that he was away from home," remarked dowager ladyChia. As she spoke, she turned her head round and called Pao-yue.
Pao-yue had, as it happened, just returned from outside where he had beento make himself comfortable, and with speedy step, he came forward. "Myrespects to you, grandfather Chang," he said.
The Taoist Chang eagerly clasped him in his arms and inquired how he wasgetting on. Turning towards old lady Chia, "Mr. Pao," he observed, "hasgrown fatter than ever."
"Outwardly, his looks," replied dowager lady Chia, "may be all right,but, inwardly, he is weak. In addition to this, his father presses himso much to study that he has again and again managed, all through thisbullying, to make his child fall sick."
"The other day," continued Chang the Taoist, "I went to several placeson a visit, and saw characters written by Mr. Pao and verses composed byhim, all of which were exceedingly good; so how is it that his worthyfather still feels displeased with him, and maintains that Mr. Pao isnot very fond of his books? According to my humble idea, he knows quiteenough. As I consider Mr. Pao's face, his bearing, his speech and hisdeportment," he proceeded, heaving a sigh, "what a striking resemblanceI find in him to the former duke of the Jung mansion!" As he utteredthese words, tears rolled down his cheeks.
At these words, old lady Chia herself found it hard to control herfeelings. Her face became covered with the traces of tears. "Quite so,"she assented, "I've had ever so many sons and grandsons, and not one ofthem betrayed the slightest resemblance to his grandfather; and thisPao-yue turns out to be the very image of him!"
"What the former duke of Jung Kuo was like in appearance," Chang, theTaoist went on to remark, addressing himself to Chia Chen, "yougentlemen, and your generation, were, of course, needless to say, not intime to see for yourselves; but I fancy that even our Senior master andour Master Secundus have but a faint recollection of it."
This said, he burst into another loud fit of laughter. "The other day,"he resumed, "I was at some one's house and there I met a young girl, whois this year in her fifteenth year, and verily gifted with a beautifulface, and I bethought myself that Mr. Pao must also have a wife foundfor him. As far as looks, intelligence and mental talents, extractionand family standing go, this maiden is a suitable match for him. But asI didn't know what your venerable ladyship would have to say about it,your servant did not presume to act recklessly, but waited until I couldascertain your wishes before I took upon myself to open my mouth withthe parties concerned."
"Some time ago," responded dowager lady Chia, "a bonze explained that itwas ordained by destiny that this child shouldn't be married at an earlyage, and that we should put things off until he grew somewhat in yearsbefore anything was settled. But mark my words now. Pay no regard as towhether she be of wealthy and honourable stock or not, the essentialthing is to find one whose looks make her a fit match for him and thencome at once and tell me. For even admitting that the girl is poor, allI shall have to do will be to bestow on her a few ounces of silver; butfine looks and a sweet temperament are not easy things to come across."
When she had done speaking, lady Feng was heard to smilingly interpose:"Grandfather Chang, aren't you going to change the talisman of 'RecordedName' of our daughter? The other day, lucky enough for you, you hadagain the great cheek to send some one to ask me for some satin ofgosling-yellow colour. I gave it to you, for had I not, I was afraidlest your old face should have been made to feel uneasy."
"Hah, hah," roared the Taoist Chang, "just see how my eyes must havegrown dim! I didn't notice that you, my lady, were in here; nor did Iexpress one word of thanks to you! The talisman of 'Recorded Name' isready long ago. I meant to have sent it over the day before yesterday,but the unforeseen visit of the Empress to perform meritorious deedsupset my equilibrium, and made me quite forget it. But it's still placedbefore the gods, and if you will wait I'll go and fetch it."
Saying this, he rushed into the main hall. Presently, he returned with atea-tray in hand, on which was spread a deep red satin cover, brocadedwith dragons. In this, he presented the charm. Ta Chieh-erh's nurse tookit from him.
But just as the Taoist was on the point of taking Ta Chieh-erh in hisembrace, lady Feng remarked with a smile: "It would have been sufficientif you'd carried it in your hand! And why use a tray to lay it on?"
"My hands aren't clean," replied the Taoist Chang, "so how could I verywell have taken hold of it? A tray therefore made things much cleaner!"
"When you produced that tray just now," laughed lady Feng, "you gave mequite a start; I didn't imagine that it was for the purpose of bringingthe charm in. It really looked as if you were disposed to beg donationsof us."
This observation sent the whole company into a violent fit of laughter.Even Chia Chen could not suppress a smile.
"What a monkey!" dowager lady Chia exclaimed, turning her head round."What a monkey you are! Aren't you afraid of going down to that Hell,where tongues are cut off?"
"I've got nothing to do with any men whatever," rejoined lady Fenglaughing, "and why does he time and again tell me that it's my boundenduty to lay up a store of meritorious deeds; and that if I'm remiss, mylife will be short?"
Chang, the Taoist, indulged in further laughter. "I brought out," heexplained, "the tray so as to kill two birds with one stone. It wasn't,however, to beg for donations. On the contrary, it was in order to putin it the jade, which I meant to ask Mr. Pao to take off, so as to carryit outside and let all those Taoist friends of mine, who come from faraway, as well as my neophytes and the young apprentices, see what it'slike."
"Well, since that be the case," added old lady Chia, "why do you, atyour age, try your strength by running about the whole day long? Takehim at once along and let them see it! But were you to have called himin there, wouldn't it have saved a lot of trouble?"
"Your venerable ladyship," resumed Chang, the Taoist, "isn't aware thatthough I be, to look at, a man of eighty, I, after all, continue, thanksto your protection, my dowager lady, quite hale and strong. In thesecond place, there are crowds of people in the outer rooms; and thesmells are not agreeable. Besides it's a very hot day and Mr. Paocouldn't stand the heat as he is not accustomed to it. So were he tocatch any disease from the filthy odours, it would be a grave thing!"
After these forebodings old lady Chia accordingly desired Pao-yue tounclasp the jade of Spiritual Perception, and to deposit it in the tray.The Taoist, Chang, carefully ensconced it in the folds of the wrapper,embroidered with dragons, and left the room, supporting the tray withboth his hands.
During this while, dowager lady Chia and the other inmates devoted moreof their time in visiting the various places. But just as they were onthe point of going up the two-storied building, they heard Chia Chenshout: "Grandfather Chang has brought back the jade."
As he spoke, the Taoist Chang was seen advancing up to them, the tray inhand. "The whole company," he smiled, "were much obliged to me. Theythink Mr. Pao's jade really lovely! None of them have, however, anysuitable gifts to bestow. These are religious articles, used by each ofthem in propagating the doctrines of Reason, but they're all only tooready to give them as congratulatory presents. If, Mr. Pao, you don'tfancy them for anything else, just keep them to play with or to giveaway to others."
Dowager lady Chia, at these words, looked into the tray. She discoveredthat its contents consisted of gold signets, and jade rings, orsceptres, implying: "may you have your wishes accomplished ineverything," or "may you enjoy peace and health from year to year;" thatthe various articles were strung with pearls or inlaid with preciousstones, worked in jade or mounted in gold; and that they were in allfrom thirty to fifty.
"What nonsense you're talking!" she then exclaimed. "Those people areall divines, and where could they have rummaged up these things? Butwhat need is there for any such presents? He may, on no account, acceptthem."
"These are intended as a small token of their esteem," responded Chang,the Taoist, smiling, "your servant cannot therefore venture to interferewith them. If your venerable ladyship will not keep them, won't you makeit patent to them that I'm treated contemptuously, and unlike what oneshould be, who has joined the order through your household?"
Only when old lady Chia heard these arguments did she direct a servantto receive the presents.
"Venerable senior," Pao-yue smilingly chimed in. "After the reasonsadvanced by grandfather Chang, we cannot possibly refuse them. Butalbeit I feel disposed to keep these things, they are of no avail to me;so would it not be well were a servant told to carry the tray and tofollow me out of doors, that I may distribute them to the poor?
"You are perfectly right in what you say!" smiled dowager lady Chia.
The Taoist Chang, however, went on speedily to use various arguments todissuade him. "Mr. Pao," he observed, "your intention is, it is true, toperform charitable acts; but though you may aver that these things areof little value, you'll nevertheless find among them several articlesyou might turn to some account. Were you to let the beggars have them,why they will, first of all, be none the better for them; and, next, itwill contrariwise be tantamount to throwing them away! If you want todistribute anything among the poor, why don't you dole out cash tothem?"
"Put them by!" promptly shouted Pao-yue, after this rejoinder, "and whenevening comes, take a few cash and distribute them."
These directions given, Chang, the Taoist, retired out of the place.
Dowager lady Chia and her companions thereupon walked upstairs and satin the main part of the building. Lady Feng and her friends adjournedinto the eastern part, while the waiting-maids and servants remained inthe western portion, and took their turns in waiting on theirmistresses.
Before long, Chia Chen came back. "The plays," he announced, "have beenchosen by means of slips picked out before the god. The first one on thelist is the 'Record of the White Snake.'"
"Of what kind of old story does 'the record of the white snake,' treat?"old lady Chia inquired.
"The story about Han Kao-tsu," replied Chia Chen, "killing a snake andthen ascending the throne. The second play is, 'the Bed covered withivory tablets.'"
"Has this been assigned the second place?" asked dowager lady Chia. "Yetnever mind; for as the gods will it thus, there is no help than not todemur. But what about the third play?" she went on to inquire.
"The Nan Ko dream is the third," Chia Chen answered.
This response elicited no comment from dowager lady Chia. Chia Chentherefore withdrew downstairs, and betook himself outside to makearrangements for the offerings to the gods, for the paper money andeatables that had to be burnt, and for the theatricals about to begin.So we will leave him without any further allusion, and take up ournarrative with Pao-yue.
Seating himself upstairs next to old lady Chia, he called to aservant-girl to fetch the tray of presents given to him a short whileback, and putting on his own trinket of jade, he fumbled about with thethings for a bit, and picking up one by one, he handed them to hisgrandmother to admire. But old lady Chia espied among them a unicorn,made of purplish gold, with kingfisher feathers inserted, and eagerlyextending her arm, she took it up. "This object," she smiled, "seems tome to resemble very much one I've seen worn also by the young lady ofsome household or other of ours."
"Senior cousin, Shih Hsiang-yuen," chimed in Pao-ch'ai, a smile playingon her lips, "has one, but it's a trifle smaller than this."
"Is it indeed Yuen-erh who has it?" exclaimed old lady Chia.
"Now that she lives in our house," remarked Pao-yue, "how is it that evenI haven't seen anything of it?"
"Cousin Pao-ch'ai," rejoined T'an Ch'un laughingly, "has the power ofobservation; no matter what she sees, she remembers."
Lin Tai-yue gave a sardonic smile. "As far as other matters areconcerned," she insinuated, "her observation isn't worth speaking of;where she's extra-observant is in articles people may wear about theirpersons."
Pao-chai, upon catching this sneering remark, at once turned her headround, and pretended she had not heard. But as soon as Pao-yue learntthat Shih Hsiang-yuen possessed a similar trinket, he speedily picked upthe unicorn, and hid it in his breast, indulging, at the same time, infurther reflection. Yet, fearing lest people might have noticed that hekept back that particular thing the moment he discovered that ShihHsiang-yuen had one identical with it, he fixed his eyes intently uponall around while clutching it. He found however that not one of them waspaying any heed to his movements except Lin Tai-yue, who, while gazing athim was, nodding her head, as if with the idea of expressing heradmiration. Pao-yue, therefore, at once felt inwardly ill at ease, andpulling out his hand, he observed, addressing himself to Tai-yue with anassumed smile, "This is really a fine thing to play with; I'll keep itfor you, and when we get back home, I'll pass a ribbon through it foryou to wear." "I don't care about it," said Lin Tai-yue, giving her heada sudden twist.
"Well," continued Pao-yue laughingly, "if you don't like it, I can't dootherwise than keep it myself."
Saying this, he once again thrust it away. But just as he was about toopen his lips to make some other observation, he saw Mrs. Yu, the spouseof Chia Chen, arrive along with the second wife recently married by ChiaJung, that is, his mother and her daughter-in-law, to pay theirobeisance to dowager lady Chia.
"What do you people rush over here for again?" old lady Chia inquired.
"I came here for a turn, simply because I had nothing to do."
But no sooner was this inquiry concluded than they heard a messengerannounce: "that some one had come from the house of general Feng."
The family of Feng Tzu-ying had, it must be explained, come to learn thenews that the inmates of the Chia mansion were offering a thanksgivingservice in the temple, and, without loss of time, they got togetherpresents of pigs, sheep, candles, tea and eatables and sent them over.The moment lady Feng heard about it she hastily crossed to the main partof the two-storied building. "Ai-ya;" she ejaculated, clapping her handsand laughing. "I never expected anything of the sort; we merely saidthat we ladies were coming for a leisurely stroll and people imaginedthat we were spreading a sumptuous altar with lenten viands and came tobring us offerings! But it's all our old lady's fault for bruiting itabout! Why, we haven't even got any slips of paper with tips ready."
She had just finished speaking, when she perceived two matrons, whoacted as house-keepers in the Feng family, walk upstairs. But before theFeng servants could take their leave, presents likewise arrived, inquick succession, from Chao, the Vice-President of the Board. In duecourse, one lot of visitors followed another. For as every one got windof the fact that the Chia family was having thanksgiving services, andthat the ladies were in the temple, distant and close relatives,friends, old friends and acquaintances all came to present theircontributions. So much so, that dowager lady Chia began at this junctureto feel sorry that she had ever let the cat out of the bag. "This is noregular fasting," she said, "we simply have come for a little change;and we should not have put any one to any inconvenience!" Althoughtherefore she was to have remained present all day at the theatricalperformance, she promptly returned home soon after noon, and the nextday she felt very loth to go out of doors again.
"By striking the wall, we've also stirred up dust," lady Feng argued."Why we've already put those people to the trouble so we should only betoo glad to-day to have another outing."
But as when dowager lady Chia interviewed the Taoist Chang, the previousday, he made allusion to Pao-yue and canvassed his engagement, Pao-yueexperienced, little as one would have thought it, much secretdispleasure during the whole of that day, and on his return home he flewinto a rage and abused Chang, the rationalistic priest, for harbouringdesigns to try and settle a match for him. At every breath and at everyword he resolved that henceforward he would not set eyes again upon theTaoist Chang. But no one but himself had any idea of the reason thatactuated him to absent himself. In the next place, Lin Tai-yue beganalso, on her return the day before, to ail from a touch of the sun, sotheir grandmother was induced by these two considerations to remain firmin her decision not to go. When lady Feng, however, found that she wouldnot join them, she herself took charge of the family party and set outon the excursion.
But without descending to particulars, let us advert to Pao-yue. Seeingthat Lin Tai-yue had fallen ill, he was so full of solicitude on heraccount that he even had little thought for any of his meals, and notlong elapsed before he came to inquire how she was.
Tai-yue, on her part, gave way to fear lest anything should happen tohim, (and she tried to re-assure him). "Just go and look at the plays,"she therefore replied, "what's the use of boxing yourself up at home?"
Pao-yue was, however, not in a very happy frame of mind on account of thereference to his marriage made by Chang, the Taoist, the day before, sowhen he heard Lin Tai-yue's utterances: "If others don't understand me;"he mused, "it's anyhow excusable; but has she too begun to make fun ofme?" His heart smarted in consequence under the sting of a mortificationa hundred times keener than he had experienced up to that occasion. Hadhe been with any one else, it would have been utterly impossible for herto have brought into play feelings of such resentment, but as it was noother than Tai-yue who spoke the words, the impression produced upon himwas indeed different from that left in days gone by, when othersemployed similar language. Unable to curb his feelings, heinstantaneously lowered his face. "My friendship with you has been of noavail" he rejoined. "But, never mind, patience!"
This insinuation induced Lin Tai-yue to smile a couple of sarcasticsmiles. "Yes, your friendship with me has been of no avail," sherepeated; "for how can I compare with those whose manifold qualitiesmake them fit matches for you?"
As soon as this sneer fell on Pao-yue's ear he drew near to her. "Are youby telling me this," he asked straight to her face, "deliberately bentupon invoking imprecations upon me that I should be annihilated byheaven and extinguished by earth?"
Lin Tai-yue could not for a time fathom the import of his remarks. "Itwas," Pao-yue then resumed, "on account of this very conversation that Iyesterday swore several oaths, and now would you really make me repeatanother one? But were the heavens to annihilate me and the earth toextinguish me, what benefit would you derive?"
This rejoinder reminded Tai-yue of the drift of their conversation on theprevious day. And as indeed she had on this occasion framed in wordsthose sentiments, which should not have dropped from her lips, sheexperienced both annoyance and shame, and she tremulously observed: "IfI entertain any deliberate intention to bring any harm upon you, may Itoo be destroyed by heaven and exterminated by earth! But what's the useof all this! I know very well that the allusion to marriage madeyesterday by Chang, the Taoist, fills you with dread lest he mightinterfere with your choice. You are inwardly so irate that you come andtreat me as your malignant influence."
Pao-yue, the fact is, had ever since his youth developed a peculiar kindof mean and silly propensity. Having moreover from tender infancy grownup side by side with Tai-Yue, their hearts and their feelings were inperfect harmony. More, he had recently come to know to a great extentwhat was what, and had also filled his head with the contents of anumber of corrupt books and licentious stories. Of all the eminent andbeautiful girls that he had met too in the families of either distant orclose relatives or of friends, not one could reach the standard of LinTai-yue. Hence it was that he commenced, from an early period of hislife, to foster sentiments of love for her; but as he could not verywell give utterance to them, he felt time and again sometimes elated,sometimes vexed, and wont to exhaust every means to secretly subject herheart to a test.
Lin Tai-yue happened, on the other hand, to possess in like manner asomewhat silly disposition; and she too frequently had recourse tofeigned sentiments to feel her way. And as she began to conceal her truefeelings and inclinations and to simply dissimulate, and he to concealhis true sentiments and wishes and to dissemble, the two unrealitiesthus blending together constituted eventually one reality. But it washardly to be expected that trifles would not be the cause of tiffsbetween them. Thus it was that in Pao-yue's mind at this time prevailedthe reflection: "that were others unable to read my feelings, it wouldanyhow be excusable; but is it likely that you cannot realise that in myheart and in my eyes there is no one else besides yourself. But as youwere not able to do anything to dispel my annoyance, but made use,instead, of the language you did to laugh at me, and to gag my mouth,it's evident that though you hold, at every second and at every moment,a place in my heart, I don't, in fact, occupy a place in yours." Suchwas the construction attached to her conduct by Pao-yue, yet he did nothave the courage to tax her with it.
"If, really, I hold a place in your heart," Lin Tai-yue again reflected,"why do you, albeit what's said about gold and jade being a fit match,attach more importance to this perverse report and think nothing of whatI say? Did you, when I so often broach the subject of this gold andjade, behave as if you, verily, had never heard anything about it, Iwould then have seen that you treat me with preference and that youdon't harbour the least particle of a secret design. But how is it thatthe moment I allude to the topic of gold and jade, you at once lose allpatience? This is proof enough that you are continuously pondering overthat gold and jade, and that as soon as you hear me speak to you aboutthem, you apprehend that I shall once more give way to conjectures, andintentionally pretend to be quite out of temper, with the deliberateidea of cajoling me!"
These two cousins had, to all appearances, once been of one and the samemind, but the many issues, which had sprung up between them, broughtabout a contrary result and made them of two distinct minds.
"I don't care what you do, everything is well," Pao-yue further argued,"so long as you act up to your feelings; and if you do, I shall be everonly too willing to even suffer immediate death for your sake. Whetheryou know this or not, doesn't matter; it's all the same. Yet were you tojust do as my heart would have you, you'll afford me a clear proof thatyou and I are united by close ties and that you are no stranger to me!"
"Just you mind your own business," Lin Tai-yue on her side cogitated. "Ifyou will treat me well, I'll treat you well. And what need is there toput an end to yourself for my sake? Are you not aware that if you killyourself, I'll also kill myself? But this demonstrates that you don'twish me to be near to you, and that you really want that I should bedistant to you."
It will thus be seen that the desire, by which they were both actuated,to strive and draw each other close and ever closer became contrariwisetransformed into a wish to become more distant. But as it is no easytask to frame into words the manifold secret thoughts entertained byeither, we will now confine ourselves to a consideration of theirexternal manner.
The three words "a fine match," which Pao-yue heard again Lin Tai-yuepronounce proved so revolting to him that his heart got full of disgustand he was unable to give utterance to a single syllable. Losing allcontrol over his temper, he snatched from his neck the jade of SpiritualPerception and, clenching his teeth, he spitefully dashed it down on thefloor. "What rubbishy trash!" he cried. "I'll smash you to atoms and putan end to the whole question!"
The jade, however, happened to be of extraordinary hardness, and didnot, after all, sustain the slightest injury from this single fall. WhenPao-yue realised that it had not broken, he forthwith turned himselfround to get the trinket with the idea of carrying out his design ofsmashing it, but Tai-yue divined his intention, and soon started crying."What's the use of all this!" she demurred, "and why, pray, do youbatter that dumb thing about? Instead of smashing it, wouldn't it bebetter for you to come and smash me!"
But in the middle of their dispute, Tzu Chuean, Hsueeh Yen and the othermaids promptly interfered and quieted them. Subsequently, however, theysaw how deliberately bent Pao-yue was upon breaking the jade, and theyvehemently rushed up to him to snatch it from his hands. But they failedin their endeavours, and perceiving that he was getting more troublesomethan he had ever been before, they had no alternative but to go and callHsi Jen. Hsi Jen lost no time in running over and succeeded, at length,in getting hold of the trinket.
"I'm smashing what belongs to me," remarked Pao-yue with a cynical smile,"and what has that to do with you people?"
Hsi Jen noticed that his face had grown quite sallow from anger, thathis eyes had assumed a totally unusual expression, and that he had neverhitherto had such a fit of ill-temper and she hastened to take his handin hers and to smilingly expostulate with him. "If you've had a tiffwith your cousin," she said, "it isn't worth while flinging this down!Had you broken it, how would her heart and face have been able to bearthe mortification?"
Lin Tai-yue shed tears and listened the while to her remonstrances. Yetthese words, which so corresponded with her own feelings, made it clearto her that Pao-yue could not even compare with Hsi Jen and wounded herheart so much more to the quick that she began to weep aloud. But themoment she got so vexed she found it hard to keep down the potion ofboletus and the decoction, for counter-acting the effects of the sun,she had taken only a few minutes back, and with a retch she broughteverything up. Tzu Chuean immediately pressed to her side and used herhandkerchief to stop her mouth with. But mouthful succeeded mouthful,and in no time the handkerchief was soaked through and through.
Hsueeh Yen then approached in a hurry and tapped her on the back.
"You may, of course, give way to displeasure," Tzu Chuean argued; "butyou should, after all, take good care of yourself Miss. You had justtaken the medicines and felt the better for them; and here you now beginvomitting again; and all because you've had a few words with our masterSecundus. But should your complaint break out afresh how will Mr. Paobear the blow?"
The moment Pao-yue caught this advice, which accorded so thoroughly withhis own ideas, he found how little Tai-yue could hold her own with TzuChuean. And perceiving how flushed Tai-yue's face was, how her templeswere swollen, how, while sobbing, she panted; and how, while crying, shewas suffused with perspiration, and betrayed signs of extreme weakness,he began, at the sight of her condition, to reproach himself. "Ishouldn't," he reflected, "have bandied words with her; for now thatshe's got into this frame of mind, I mayn't even suffer in her stead!"
The self-reproaches, however, which gnawed his heart made it impossiblefor him to refrain from tears, much as he fought against them. Hsi Jensaw them both crying, and while attending to Pao-yue, she too unavoidablyexperienced much soreness of heart. She nevertheless went on rubbingPao-yue's hands, which were icy cold. She felt inclined to advise Pao-yuenot to weep, but fearing again lest, in the first place, Pao-yue might beinwardly aggrieved, and nervous, in the next, lest she should not bedealing rightly by Tai-yue, she thought it advisable that they should allhave a good cry, as they might then be able to leave off. She herselftherefore also melted into tears. As for Tzu-Chuean, at one time, shecleaned the expectorated medicine; at another, she took up a fan andgently fanned Tai-yue. But at the sight of the trio plunged in perfectsilence, and of one and all sobbing for reasons of their own, grief,much though she did to struggle against it, mastered her feelings too,and producing a handkerchief, she dried the tears that came to her eyes.So there stood four inmates, face to face, uttering not a word andindulging in weeping.
Shortly, Hsi Jen made a supreme effort, and smilingly said to Pao-yue:"If you don't care for anything else, you should at least have shownsome regard for those tassels, strung on the jade, and not have wrangledwith Miss Lin."
Tai-yue heard these words, and, mindless of her indisposition, she rushedover, and snatching the trinket, she picked up a pair of scissors, lyingclose at hand, bent upon cutting the tassels. Hsi Jen and Tzu Chuean wereon the point of wresting it from her, but she had already managed tomangle them into several pieces.
"I have," sobbed Tai-yue, "wasted my energies on them for nothing; for hedoesn't prize them. He's certain to find others to string some more finetassels for him."
Hsi Jen promptly took the jade. "Is it worth while going on in thisway!" she cried. "But this is all my fault for having blabbered just nowwhat should have been left unsaid."
"Cut it, if you like!" chimed in Pao-yue, addressing himself to Tai-yue."I will on no account wear it, so it doesn't matter a rap."
But while all they minded inside was to create this commotion, theylittle dreamt that the old matrons had descried Tai-yue weep bitterly andvomit copiously, and Pao-yue again dash his jade on the ground, and thatnot knowing how far the excitement might not go, and whether theythemselves might not become involved, they had repaired in a body to thefront, and reported the occurrence to dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang,their object being to try and avoid being themselves implicated in thematter. Their old mistress and Madame Wang, seeing them make so much ofthe occurrence as to rush with precipitate haste to bring it to theirnotice, could not in the least imagine what great disaster might nothave befallen them, and without loss of time they betook themselvestogether into the garden and came to see what the two cousins were upto.
Hsi Jen felt irritated and harboured resentment against Tzu Chuean,unable to conceive what business she had to go and disturb their oldmistress and Madame Wang. But Tzu Chuean, on the other hand, presumedthat it was Hsi Jen, who had gone and reported the matter to them, andshe too cherished angry feelings towards Hsi Jen.
Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang walked into the apartment. They foundPao-yue on one side saying not a word. Lin Tai-yue on the other utteringnot a sound. "What's up again?" they asked. But throwing the whole blameupon the shoulders of Hsi Jen and Tzu Chuean, "why is it," they inquired,"that you were not diligent in your attendance on them. They now start aquarrel, and don't you exert yourselves in the least to restrain them?"
Therefore with obloquy and hard words they rated the two girls for atime in such a way that neither of them could put in a word by way ofreply, but felt compelled to listen patiently. And it was only afterdowager lady Chia had taken Pao-yue away with her that things quieteddown again.
One day passed. Then came the third of the moon. This was Hsueeh Pan'sbirthday, so in their house a banquet was spread and preparations madefor a performance; and to these the various inmates of the Chia mansionwent. But as Pao-yue had so hurt Tai-yue's feelings, the two cousins sawnothing whatever of each other, and conscience-stricken, despondent andunhappy, as he was at this time could he have had any inclination to bepresent at the plays? Hence it was that he refused to go on the pretextof indisposition.
Lin Tai-yue had got, a couple of days back, but a slight touch of the sunand naturally there was nothing much the matter with her. When the newshowever reached her that he did not intend to join the party, "If withhis weakness for wine and for theatricals," she pondered within herself,"he now chooses to stay away, instead of going, why, that quarrel withme yesterday must be at the bottom of it all. If this isn't the reason,well then it must be that he has no wish to attend, as he sees that I'mnot going either. But I should on no account have cut the tassels fromthat jade, for I feel sure he won't wear it again. I shall thereforehave to string some more on to it, before he puts it on."
On this account the keenest remorse gnawed her heart.
Dowager lady Chia saw well enough that they were both under theinfluence of temper. "We should avail ourselves of this occasion," shesaid to herself, "to go over and look at the plays, and as soon as thetwo young people come face to face, everything will be squared."Contrary to her expectations neither of them would volunteer to go. Thisso exasperated their old grandmother that she felt vexed with them. "Inwhat part of my previous existence could an old sufferer like myself,"she exclaimed, "have incurred such retribution that my destiny is tocome across these two troublesome new-fledged foes! Why, not a singleday goes by without their being instrumental in worrying my mind! Theproverb is indeed correct which says: 'that people who are not enemiesare not brought together!' But shortly my eyes shall be closed, thisbreath of mine shall be snapped, and those two enemies will be free tocause trouble even up to the very skies; for as my eyes will then loosetheir power of vision, and my heart will be void of concern, it willreally be nothing to me. But I couldn't very well stifle this breath oflife of mine!"
While inwardly a prey to resentment, she also melted into tears.
These words were brought to the ears of Pao-yue and Tai-yue. Neither ofthem had hitherto heard the adage: "people who are not enemies are notbrought together," so when they suddenly got to know the line, it seemedas if they had apprehended abstraction. Both lowered their heads andmeditated on the subtle sense of the saying. But unconsciously a streamof tears rolled down their cheeks. They could not, it is true, get aglimpse of each other; yet as the one was in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge,standing in the breeze, bedewed with tears, and the other in the I Hungcourt, facing the moon and heaving deep sighs, was it not, in fact, acase of two persons living in two distinct places, yet with feelingsemanating from one and the same heart?
Hsi Jen consequently tendered advice to Pao-yue. "You're a million timesto blame," she said, "it's you who are entirely at fault! For when sometime ago the pages in the establishment, wrangled with their sisters, orwhen husband and wife fell out, and you came to hear anything about it,you blew up the lads, and called them fools for not having the heart toshow some regard to girls; and now here you go and follow their lead.But to-morrow is the fifth day of the moon, a great festival, and willyou two still continue like this, as if you were very enemies? If so,our venerable mistress will be the more angry, and she certainly will bedriven sick! I advise you therefore to do what's right by suppressingyour spite and confessing your fault, so that we should all be on thesame terms as hitherto. You here will then be all right, and so will sheover there."
Pao-yue listened to what she had to say; but whether he fell in with herviews or not is not yet ascertained; yet if you, reader, choose to know,we will explain in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XXX.
  Pao-ch'ai avails herself of the excuse afforded her by a fan to      administer a couple of raps.  While Ch'un Ling traces, in a absent frame of mind, the outlines of      the character Ch'iang, a looker-on appears on the scene.
Lin Tai-yue herself, for we will now resume our narrative, was also, eversince her tiff with Pao-yue, full of self-condemnation, yet as she didnot see why she should run after him, she continued, day and night, asdespondent as she would have been had she lost some thing or otherbelonging to her.
Tzu Chuean surmised her sentiments. "As regards what happened the otherday," she advised her, "you were, after all, Miss, a little too hasty;for if others don't understand that temperament of Pao-yue's, have youand I, surely, also no idea about it? Besides, haven't there beenalready one or two rows on account of that very jade?"
"Ts'ui!" exclaimed Tai-yue. "Have you come, on behalf of others, to findfault with me? But how ever was I hasty?"
"Why did you," smiled Tzu Chuean, "take the scissors and cut that tasselwhen there was no good reason for it? So isn't Pao-yue less to blame thanyourself, Miss? I've always found his behaviour towards you, Miss,without a fault. It's all that touchy disposition of yours, which makesyou so often perverse, that induces him to act as he does."
Lin Tai-yue had every wish to make some suitable reply, when she heardsome one calling at the door. Tzu Chuean discerned the tone of voice."This sounds like Pao-yue's voice," she smiled. "I expect he's come tomake his apologies."
"I won't have any one open the door," Tai-yue cried at these words.
"Here you are in the wrong again, Miss," Tzu Chuean observed. "How willit ever do to let him get a sunstroke and come to some harm on a daylike this, and under such a scorching sun?"
Saying this, she speedily walked out and opened the door. It was indeedPao-yue. While ushering him in, she gave him a smile. "I imagined," shesaid, "that you would never again put your foot inside our door, MasterSecundus. But here you are once more and quite unexpectedly!"
"You have by dint of talking," Pao-yue laughed, "made much ado ofnothing; and why shouldn't I come, when there's no reason for me to keepaway? Were I even to die, my spirit too will come a hundred times a day!But is cousin quite well?"
"She is," replied Tzu Chuean, "physically all right; but, mentally, herresentment is not quite over."
"I understand," continued Pao-yue with a smile. "But resentment, forwhat?"
With this inquiry, he wended his steps inside the apartment. He thencaught sight of Lin Tai-yue reclining on the bed in the act of crying.Tai-yue had not in fact shed a tear, but hearing Pao-yue break in uponher, she could not help feeling upset. She found it impossible thereforeto prevent her tears from rolling down her cheeks.
Pao-yue assumed a smiling expression and drew near the bed. "Cousin, areyou quite well again?" he inquired.
Tai-yue simply went on drying her tears, and made no reply of any kind.
Pao-yue approached the bed, and sat on the edge of it. "I know," hesmiled, "that you're not vexed with me. But had I not come, thirdparties would have been allowed to notice my absence, and it would haveappeared to them as if we had had another quarrel. And had I to waituntil they came to reconcile us, would we not by that time becomeperfect strangers? It would be better, supposing you wish to beat me orblow me up, that you should please yourself and do so now; but whateveryou do, don't give me the cold shoulder!"
Continuing, he proceeded to call her "my dear cousin" for several tensof times.
Tai-yue had resolved not to pay any more heed to Pao-yue. When she,however, now heard Pao-yue urge: "don't let us allow others to knowanything about our having had a quarrel, as it will look as if we hadbecome thorough strangers," it once more became evident to her, fromthis single remark, that she was really dearer and nearer to him thanany of the other girls, so she could not refrain from saying sobbingly:"You needn't have come to chaff me! I couldn't presume henceforward tobe on friendly terms with you, Master Secundus! You should treat me asif I were gone!"
At these words, Pao-yue gave way to laughter. "Where are you off to?" heinquired.
"I'm going back home," answered Tai-yue.
"I'll go along with you then," smiled Pao-yue.
"But if I die?" asked Tai-yue.
"Well, if you die," rejoined Pao-yue, "I'll become a bonze."
The moment Tai-yue caught this reply, she hung down her head. "You must,I presume, be bent upon dying?" she cried. "But what stuff and nonsenseis this you're talking? You've got so many beloved elder and youngercousins in your family, and how many bodies will you have to go andbecome bonzes, when by and bye they all pass away! But to-morrow I'lltell them about this to judge for themselves what your motives are!"
Pao-yue was himself aware of the fact that this rejoinder had beenrecklessly spoken, and he was seized with regret. His face immediatelybecame suffused with blushes. He lowered his head and had not thecourage to utter one word more. Fortunately, however, there was no onepresent in the room.
Tai-yue stared at him for ever so long with eyes fixed straight on him,but losing control over her temper, "Ai!" she shouted, "can't youspeak?" Then when she perceived Pao-yue reduced to such straits as toturn purple, she clenched her teeth and spitefully gave him, on theforehead, a fillip with her finger. "Heug!" she cried gnashing herteeth, "you, this......" But just as she had pronounced these two words,she heaved another sigh, and picking up her handkerchief, she wiped hertears.
Pao-yue treasured at one time numberless tender things in his mind, whichhe meant to tell her, but feeling also, while he smarted under the stingof self-reproach (for the indiscretion he had committed), Tai-yue givehim a rap, he was utterly powerless to open his lips, much though he mayhave liked to speak, so he kept on sighing and snivelling to himself.With all these things therefore to work upon his feelings, heunwillingly melted into tears. He tried to find his handkerchief to dryhis face with, but unexpectedly discovering that he had again forgottento bring one with him, he was about to make his coat-sleeve answer thepurpose, when Tai-yue, albeit her eyes were watery, noticed at a glancethat he was going to use the brand-new coat of grey coloured gauze hewore, and while wiping her own, she turned herself round, and seized asilk kerchief thrown over the pillow, and thrust it into Pao-yue's lap.But without saying a word, she screened her face and continued sobbing.
Pao-yue saw the handkerchief she threw, and hastily snatching it, hewiped his tears. Then drawing nearer to her, he put out his hand andclasped her hand in his, and smilingly said to her: "You've completelylacerated my heart, and do you still cry? But let's go; I'll come alongwith you and see our venerable grandmother."
Tai-yue thrust his hand aside. "Who wants to go hand in hand with you?"she cried. "Here we grow older day after day, but we're still so full ofbrazen-faced effrontery that we don't even know what right means?"
But scarcely had she concluded before she heard a voice say aloud:"They're all right!"
Pao-yue and Tai-yue were little prepared for this surprise, and they werestartled out of their senses. Turning round to see who it was, theycaught sight of lady Feng running in, laughing and shouting. "Our oldlady," she said, "is over there, giving way to anger against heaven andearth. She would insist upon my coming to find out whether you werereconciled or not. 'There's no need for me to go and see,' I told her,'they will before the expiry of three days, be friends again of theirown accord.' Our venerable ancestor, however, called me to account, andmaintained that I was lazy; so here I come! But my words have in verydeed turned out true. I don't see why you two should always bewrangling! For three days you're on good terms and for two on bad. Youbecome more and more like children. And here you are now hand in handblubbering! But why did you again yesterday become like black-eyedfighting cocks? Don't you yet come with me to see your grandmother andmake an old lady like her set her mind at ease a bit?"
While reproaching them, she clutched Tai-yue's hand and was trudgingaway, when Tai-yue turned her head round and called out for herservant-girls. But not one of them was in attendance.
"What do you want them for again?" lady Feng asked. "I am here to waiton you!"
Still speaking, she pulled her along on their way, with Pao-yue followingin their footsteps. Then making their exit out of the garden gate, theyentered dowager lady Chia's suite of rooms. "I said that it wassuperfluous for any one to trouble," lady Feng smiled, "as they weresure of themselves to become reconciled; but you, dear ancestor, solittle believed it that you insisted upon my going to act the part ofmediator. Yet when I got there, with the intention of inducing them tomake it up, I found them, though one did not expect it, in each other'scompany, confessing their faults, and laughing and chatting. Just like ayellow eagle clutching the feet of a kite were those two hanging on toeach other. So where was the necessity for any one to go?"
These words evoked laughter from every one in the room. Pao-ch'ai,however, was present at the time so Lin Tai-yue did not retort, but wentand ensconced herself in a seat near her grandmother.
When Pao-yue noticed that no one had anything to say, he smilinglyaddressed himself to Pao-ch'ai. "On cousin Hsueeh P'an's birth-day," heremarked, "I happened again to be unwell, so not only did I not send himany presents, but I failed to go and knock my head before him. Yetcousin knows nothing about my having been ill, and it will seem to himthat I had no wish to go, and that I brought forward excuses so as toavoid paying him a visit. If to-morrow you find any leisure, cousin, dotherefore explain matters for me to him."
"This is too much punctiliousness!" smiled Pao-ch'ai. "Even had youinsisted upon going, we wouldn't have been so arrogant as to let you putyourself to the trouble, and how much less when you were not feelingwell? You two are cousins and are always to be found together the wholeday; if you encourage such ideas, some estrangement will, after all,arise between you."
"Cousin," continued Pao-yue smilingly, "you know what to say; and so longas you're lenient with me all will be all right. But how is it," he wenton to ask, "that you haven't gone over to see the theatricals?"
"I couldn't stand the heat" rejoined Pao-ch'ai. "I looked on while twoplays were being sung, but I found it so intensely hot, that I feltanxious to retire. But the visitors not having dispersed, I had to giveas an excuse that I wasn't feeling up to the mark, and so came away atonce."
Pao-yue, at these words, could not but feel ill at ease. All he could dowas to feign another smile. "It's no wonder," he observed, "that theycompare you, cousin, to Yang Kuei-fei; for she too was fat and afraid ofhot weather."
Hearing this, Pao-ch'ai involuntarily flew into a violent rage. Yet whenabout to call him to task, she found that it would not be nice for herto do so. After some reflection, the colour rushed to her cheeks.Smiling ironically twice, "I may resemble," she said, "Yang Kuei-fei,but there's not one of you young men, whether senior or junior, goodenough to play the part of Yang Kuo-chung."
While they were bandying words, a servant-girl Ch'ing Erh, lost sight ofher fan and laughingly remarked to Pao-ch'ai: "It must be you, Miss Pao,who have put my fan away somewhere or other; dear mistress, do let mehave it!"
"You'd better be mindful!" rejoined Pao-ch'ai, shaking her finger ather. "With whom have I ever been up to jokes, that you come and suspectme? Have I hitherto laughed and smirked with you? There's that whole lotof girls, go and ask them about it!"
At this suggestion, Ch'ing Erh made her escape.
The consciousness then burst upon Pao-yue, that he had again beeninconsiderate in his speech, in the presence of so many persons, and hewas overcome by a greater sense of shame than when, a short while back,he had been speaking with Lin Tai-yue. Precipitately turning himselfround, he went, therefore, and talked to the others as well.
The sight of Pao-yue poking fun at Pao-ch'ai gratified Tai-yue immensely.She was just about to put in her word and also seize the opportunity ofchaffing her, but as Ch'ing Erh unawares asked for her fan and Pao-ch'aiadded a few more remarks, she at once changed her purpose. "CousinPao-ch'ai," she inquired, "what two plays did you hear?"
Pao-ch'ai caught the expression of gratification in Tai-yue'scountenance, and concluded that she had for a certainty heard theraillery recently indulged in by Pao-yue and that it had fallen in withher own wishes; and hearing her also suddenly ask the question she did,she answered with a significant laugh: "What I saw was: 'Li Kuei blowsup Sung Chiang and subsequently again tenders his apologies'."
Pao-yue smiled. "How is it," he said, "that with such wide knowledge ofthings new as well as old; and such general information as you possess,you aren't even up to the name of a play, and that you've come out withsuch a whole string of words. Why, the real name of the play is:'Carrying a birch and begging for punishment'".
"Is it truly called: 'Carrying a birch and begging for punishment'"?Pao-ch'ai asked with laugh. "But you people know all things new and oldso are able to understand the import of 'carrying a birch and beggingfor punishment.' As for me I've no idea whatever what 'carrying a birchand begging for punishment' implies."
One sentence was scarcely ended when Pao-yue and Tai-yue felt guilty intheir consciences; and by the time they heard all she said, they werequite flushed from shame. Lady Feng did not, it is true, fathom the gistof what had been said, but at the sight of the expression betrayed onthe faces of the three cousins, she readily got an inkling of it. "Onthis broiling hot day," she inquired laughing also; "who still eats rawginger?"
None of the party could make out the import of her insinuation. "There'sno one eating raw ginger," they said.
Lady Feng intentionally then brought her hands to her cheeks, andrubbing them, she remarked with an air of utter astonishment, "Sincethere's no one eating raw ginger, how is it that you are all so fiery inthe face?"
Hearing this, Pao-yue and Tai-yue waxed more uncomfortable than ever. Somuch so, that Pao-ch'ai, who meant to continue the conversation, did notthink it nice to say anything more when she saw how utterly abashedPao-yue was and how changed his manner. Her only course was therefore tosmile and hold her peace. And as the rest of the inmates had not thefaintest notion of the drift of the remarks exchanged between the fourof them, they consequently followed her lead and put on a smile.
In a short while, however, Pao-ch'ai and lady Feng took their leave.
"You've also tried your strength with them," Tai-yue said to Pao-yuelaughingly. "But they're far worse than I. Is every one as simple inmind and dull of tongue as I am as to allow people to say whatever theylike."
Pao-yue was inwardly giving way to that unhappiness, which had beenoccasioned by Pao-ch'ai's touchiness, so when he also saw Tai-yueapproach him and taunt him, displeasure keener than ever was aroused inhim. A desire then asserted itself to speak out his mind to her, butdreading lest Tai-yue should he in one of her sensitive moods, he,needless to say, stifled his anger and straightway left the apartment ina state of mental depression.
It happened to be the season of the greatest heat. Breakfast time toowas already past, and masters as well as servants were, for the mostpart, under the influence of the lassitude felt on lengthy days. AsPao-yue therefore strolled, from place to place, his hands behind hisback he heard not so much as the caw of a crow. Issuing out of hisgrandmother's compound on the near side, he wended his steps westwards,and crossed the passage, on which lady Feng's quarters gave. As soon ashe reached the entrance of her court, he perceived the door ajar. Butaware of lady Feng's habit of taking, during the hot weather, a coupleof hours' siesta at noon, he did not feel it a convenient moment tointrude. Walking accordingly through the corner door, he stepped intoMadame Wang's apartment. Here he discovered several waiting-maids,dosing with their needlework clasped in their hands. Madame Wang wasasleep on the cool couch in the inner rooms. Chin Ch'uan-erh was sittingnext to her massaging her legs. But she too was quite drowsy, and hereyes wore all awry. Pao-yue drew up to her with gentle tread. The moment,however, that he unfastened the pendants from the earrings she wore,Chin Ch'uan opened her eyes, and realised that it was no one thanPao-yue.
"Are you feeling so worn out!" he smilingly remarked in a low tone ofvoice.
Chin Ch'uan pursed up her lips and gave him a smile. Then waving herhand so as to bid him quit the room, she again closed her eyes.
Pao-yue, at the sight of her, felt considerable affection for her andunable to tear himself away, so quietly stretching his head forward, andnoticing that Madame Wang's eyes were shut, he extracted from a purse,suspended about his person, one of the 'scented-snow-for-moistening-mouthpills,' with which it was full, and placed it on Chin Ch'uan-erh's lips.Chin Ch'uan-erh, however, did not open her eyes, but simply held (thepill) in her mouth. Pao-yue then approached her and took her hand in his."I'll ask you of your mistress," he gently observed smiling, "and you andI will live together."
To this Chin Ch'uan-erh said not a word.
"If that won't do," Pao-yue continued, "I'll wait for your mistress towake and appeal to her at once."
Chin Ch'uan-erh distended her eyes wide, and pushed Pao-yue off. "What'sthe hurry?" she laughed. "'A gold hair-pin may fall into the well; butif it's yours it will remain yours only.' Is it possible that you don'teven see the spirit of this proverb? But I'll tell you a smart thing.Just you go into the small court, on the east side, and you'll find foryourself what Mr. Chia Huau and Ts'ai Yun are up to!"
"Let them be up to whatever they like," smiled Pao-yue, "I shall simplystick to your side!"
But he then saw Madame Wang twist herself round, get up, and give a slapto Chin Ch'uan-erh on her mouth. "You mean wench!" she exclaimed,abusing her, while she pointed her finger at her, "it's you, and thelike of you, who corrupt these fine young fellows with all the nicethings you teach them!"
The moment Pao-yue perceived Madame Wang rise, he bolted like a streak ofsmoke. Chin Ch'uan-erh, meanwhile, felt half of her face as hot as fire,yet she did not dare utter one word of complaint. The variouswaiting-maids soon came to hear that Madame Wang had awoke and theyrushed in in a body.
"Go and tell your mother," Madame Wang thereupon said to Yue Ch'uan-erh,"to fetch your elder sister away."
Chin Ch'uan-erh, at these words, speedily fell on her knees. With tearsin her eyes: "I won't venture to do it again," she pleaded. "If you,Madame, wish to flog me, or to scold me do so at once, and as much asyou like but don't send me away. You will thus accomplish an act ofheavenly grace! I've been in attendance on your ladyship for about tenyears, and if you now drive me away, will I be able to look at any onein the face?"
Though Madame Wang was a generous, tender-hearted person, and had at notime raised her hand to give a single blow to any servant-girl, she,however, when she accidentally discovered Chin Ch'uan-erh behave on thisoccasion in this barefaced manner, a manner which had all her lifetimebeen most reprehensible to her, was so overcome by passion that she gaveChin Ch'uan-erh just one slap and spoke to her a few sharp words. Andalbeit Chin Ch'uan-erh indulged in solicitous entreaties, she would noton any account keep her in her service. At length, Chin Ch'uan-erh'smother, Dame Pao, was sent for to take her away. Chin Ch'uan-erhtherefore had to conceal her disgrace, suppress her resentment, and quitthe mansion.
But without any further reference to her, we will now take up our storywith Pao-yue. As soon as he saw Madame Wang awake, his spirits werecrushed. All alone he hastily made his way into the Ta Kuan garden. Herehis attention was attracted by the ruddy sun, shining in the zenith, theshade of the trees extending far and wide, the song of the cicadas,filling the ear; and by a perfect stillness, not even broken by the echoof a human voice. But the instant he got near the trellis, with thecinnamon roses, the sound of sobs fell on his ear. Doubts and surmisescrept into Pao-yue's mind, so halting at once, he listened withintentness. Then actually he discerned some one on the off-side of thetrellis. This was the fifth moon, the season when the flowers andfoliage of the cinnamon roses were in full bloom. Furtively peepingthrough an aperture in the fence, Pao-yue saw a young girl squattingunder the flowers and digging the ground with a hair-pin she held in herhand. As she dug, she silently gave way to tears.
"Can it be possible," mused Pao-yue, "that this girl too is stupid? Canshe also be following P'in Erh's example and come to inter flowers? Whyif she's likewise really burying flowers," he afterwards went on tosmilingly reflect, "this can aptly be termed: 'Tung Shih tries toimitate a frown.' But not only is what she does not original, but it isdespicable to boot. You needn't," he meant to shout out to the girl, atthe conclusion of this train of thought, "try and copy Miss Lin'sexample." But before the words had issued from his mouth, he luckilyscrutinised her a second time, and found that the girl's features werequite unfamiliar to him, that she was no menial, and that she lookedlike one of the twelve singing maids, who were getting up the plays. Hecould not, however, make out what _roles_ she filled: scholars,girls, old men, women, or buffoons. Pao-yue quickly put out his tongueand stopped his mouth with his hand. "How fortunate," he inwardlysoliloquised, "that I didn't make any reckless remark! It was allbecause of my inconsiderate talk on the last two occasions, that P'inErh got angry with me, and that Pao-ch'ai felt hurt. And had I now giventhem offence also, I would have been in a still more awkward fix!"
While wrapt in these thoughts, he felt much annoyance at not being ableto recognise who she was. But on further minute inspection, he noticedthat this maiden, with contracted eyebrows, as beautiful as the hills inspring, frowning eyes as clear as the streams in autumn, a face, withtransparent skin, and a slim waist, was elegant and beautiful and almostthe very image of Lin Tai-yue. Pao-yue could not, from the very first,make up his mind to wrench himself away. But as he stood gazing at herin a doltish mood, he realised that, although she was tracing on theground with the gold hair-pin, she was not digging a hole to buryflowers in, but was merely delineating characters on the surface of thesoil. Pao-yue's eyes followed the hair-pin from first to last, as it wentup and as it came down. He watched each dash, each dot and each hook. Hecounted the strokes. They numbered eighteen. He himself then set to workand sketched with his finger on the palm of his hand, the lines, intheir various directions, and in the order they had been traced a fewminutes back, so as to endeavour to guess what the character was. Oncompleting the sketch, he discovered, the moment he came to reflect,that it was the character "Ch'iang," in the combination, 'Ch'iang Wei,'representing cinnamon roses.
"She too," pondered Pao-yue, "must have been bent upon writing verses, orsupplying some line or other, and at the sight now of the flowers, theidea must have suggested itself to her mind. Or it may very likely bethat having spontaneously devised a couplet, she got suddenly elated andbegan, for fear it should slip from her memory, to trace it on theground so as to tone the rhythm. Yet there's no saying. Let me see,however, what she's going to write next."
While cogitating, he looked once more. Lo, the girl was still tracing.But tracing up or tracing down, it was ever the character "Ch'iang."When he gazed again, it was still the self-same Ch'iang.
The one inside the fence fell, in fact, from an early stage, into afoolish mood, and no sooner was one 'Ch'iang,' finished than she startedwith another; so that she had already written several tens of them. Theone outside gazed and gazed, until he unwittingly also got into the samefoolish mood. Intent with his eyes upon following the movements of thepin, in his mind, he communed thus with his own thoughts: "This girlmust, for a certainty, have something to say, or some unspeakablemomentous secret that she goes on like this. But if outwardly shebehaves in this wise, who knows what anguish she mayn't suffer at heart?And yet, with a frame to all appearances so very delicate, how could sheever resist much inward anxiety! Woe is me that I'm unable to transfersome part of her burden on to my own shoulders!"
In midsummer, cloudy and bright weather are uncertain. A few specks ofclouds suffice to bring about rain. Of a sudden, a cold blast swept by,and tossed about by the wind fell a shower of rain. Pao-yue perceivedthat the water trickling down the girl's head saturated her gauze attirein no time. "It's pouring," Pao-yue debated within himself, "and how cana frame like hers resist the brunt of such a squall." Unable thereforeto restrain himself, he vehemently shouted: "Leave off writing! See,it's pouring; you're wet through!"
The girl caught these words, and was frightened out of her wits. Raisingher head, she at once descried some one or other standing beyond theflowers and calling out to her: "Leave off writing. It's pouring!" Butas Pao-yue was, firstly, of handsome appearance, and as secondly theluxuriant abundance of flowers and foliage screened with their boughs,thick-laden with leaves, the upper and lower part of his person, justleaving half of his countenance exposed to view, the maiden simplyjumped at the conclusion that he must be a servant girl, and never for amoment dreamt that it might be Pao-yue. "Many thanks, sister, forrecalling me to my senses," she consequently smiled. "Yet is thereforsooth anything outside there to protect you from the rain?"
This single remark proved sufficient to recall Pao-yue to himself. Withan exclamation of "Ai-yah," he at length became conscious that his wholebody was cold as ice. Then drooping his head, he realised that his ownperson too was drenched. "This will never do," he cried, and with onebreath he had to run back into the I Hung court. His mind, however,continued much exercised about the girl as she had nothing to shelterher from the rain.
As the next day was the dragon-boat festival, Wen Kuan and the othersinging girls, twelve in all, were given a holiday, so they came intothe garden and amused themselves by roaming everywhere and anywhere. Asluck would have it, the two girls Pao-Kuan, who filled the _role_of young men and Yue Kuan, who represented young women, were in the IHung court enjoying themselves with Hsi Jen, when rain set in and theywere prevented from going back, so in a body they stopped up the drainto allow the water to accumulate in the yard. Then catching those thatcould be caught, and driving those that had to be driven, they laid holdof a few of the green-headed ducks, variegated marsh-birds and colouredmandarin-ducks, and tying their wings they let them loose in the courtto disport themselves. Closing the court Hsi Jen and her playmates stoodtogether under the verandah and enjoyed the fun. Pao-yue therefore foundthe entrance shut. He gave a rap at the door. But as every one insidewas bent upon laughing, they naturally did not catch the sound; and itwas only after he had called and called, and made a noise by thumping atthe door, that they at last heard. Imagining, however, that Pao-yue couldnot be coming back at that hour, Hsi Jen shouted laughing: "who's it nowknocking at the door? There's no one to go and open."
"It's I," rejoined Pao-yue.
"It's Miss Pao-ch'ai's tone of voice," added She Yueeh.
"Nonsense!" cried Ch'ing Wen. "What would Miss Pao-ch'ai come over to doat such an hour?"
"Let me go," chimed in Hsi Jen, "and see through the fissure in thedoor, and if we can open, we'll open; for we mustn't let her go back,wet through."
With these words, she came along the passage to the doorway. On lookingout, she espied Pao-yue dripping like a chicken drenched with rain.
Seeing him in this plight, Hsi Jen felt solicitous as well as amused.With alacrity, she flung the door wide open, laughing so heartily thatshe was doubled in two. "How could I ever have known," she said,clapping her hands, "that you had returned, Sir! Yet how is it thatyou've run back in this heavy rain?"
Pao-yue had, however, been feeling in no happy frame of mind. He hadfully resolved within himself to administer a few kicks to the person,who came to open the door, so as soon as it was unbarred, he did not tryto make sure who it was, but under the presumption that it was one ofthe servant-girls, he raised his leg and give her a kick on the side.
"Ai-yah!" ejaculated Hsi Jen.
Pao-yue nevertheless went on to abuse. "You mean things!" he shouted."It's because I've always treated you so considerately that you don'trespect me in the least! And you now go to the length of making alaughing-stock of me!"
As he spoke, he lowered his head. Then catching sight of Hsi Jen, intears, he realised that he had kicked the wrong person. "Hallo!" hesaid, promptly smiling, "is it you who've come? Where did I kick you?"
Hsi Jen had never, previous to this, received even a harsh word fromhim. When therefore she on this occasion unexpectedly saw Pao-yue gaveher a kick in a fit of anger and, what made it worse, in the presence ofso many people, shame, resentment, and bodily pain overpowered her andshe did not, in fact, for a time know where to go and hide herself. Shewas then about to give rein to her displeasure, but the reflection thatPao-yue could not have kicked her intentionally obliged her to suppressher indignation. "Instead of kicking," she remarked, "don't you yet goand change your clothes?"
Pao-yue walked into the room. As he did so, he smiled. "Up to the ageI've reached," he observed, "this is the first instance on which I'veever so thoroughly lost control over my temper as to strike any one;and, contrary to all my thoughts, it's you that happened to come in myway?"
Hsi Jen, while patiently enduring the pain, effected the necessarychange in his attire. "I've been here from the very first," shesimultaneously added, smilingly, "so in all things, whether large orsmall, good or bad, it has naturally fallen to my share to bear thebrunt. But not to say another word about your assault on me, why,to-morrow you'll indulge your hand and star-beating others!"
"I did not strike you intentionally just now," retorted Pao-yue.
"Who ever said," rejoined Hsi Jen, "that you did it intentionally! Ithas ever been the duty of that tribe of servant-girls to open and shutthe doors, yet they've got into the way of being obstinate, and havelong ago become such an abomination that people's teeth itch to revengethemselves on them. They don't know, besides, what fear means. So hadyou first assured yourself that it was they and given them a kick, alittle intimidating would have done them good. But I'm at the bottom ofthe mischief that happened just now, for not calling those, upon whom itdevolves, to come and open for you."
During the course of their conversation, the rain ceased, and Pao Kuanand Yue Kuan had been able to take their leave. Hsi Jen, however,experienced such intense pain in her side, and felt such inwardvexation, that at supper she could not put a morsel of anything in hermouth. When in the evening, the time came for her to have her bath, shediscovered, on divesting herself of her clothes, a bluish bruise on herside of the size of a saucer and she was very much frightened. But asshe could not very well say anything about it to any one, she presentlyretired to rest. But twitches of pain made her involuntarily moan in herdreams and groan in her sleep.
Pao-yue did, it is true, not hurt her with any malice, but when he sawHsi Jen so listless and restless, and suddenly heard her groan in thecourse of the night, he realised how severely he must have kicked her.So getting out of bed, he gently seized the lantern and came over tolook at her. But as soon as he reached the side of her bed, he perceivedHsi Jen expectorate, with a retch, a whole mouthful of phlegm. "Oh me!"she gasped, as she opened her eyes. The presence of Pao-yue startled herout of her wits. "What are you up to?" she asked.
"You groaned in your dreams," answered Pao-yue, "so I must have kickedyou hard. Do let me see!"
"My head feels giddy," said Hsi Jen. "My throat foul and sweet; throwthe light on the floor!"
At these words, Pao-yue actually raised the lantern. The moment he castthe light below, he discerned a quantity of fresh blood on the floor.
Pao-yue was seized with consternation. "Dreadful!" was all he could say.At the sight of the blood, Hsi Jen's heart too partly waxed cold.
But, reader, the next chapter will reveal the sequel, if you really haveany wish to know more about them.

CHAPTER XXXI.
  Pao-yue allows the girl Ch'ing Wen to tear his fan so as to afford her      amusement.  A wedding proves to be the result of the descent of a unicorn.
But to proceed. When she saw on the floor the blood, she had brought up,Hsi Jen immediately grew partly cold. What she had often heard peoplemention in past days 'that the lives of young people, who expectorateblood, are uncertain, and that although they may live long, they are,after all, mere wrecks,' flashed through her mind. The remembrance ofthis saying at once completely scattered to the winds the wish, she hadall along cherished, of striving for honour and of being able to boastof glory; and from her eyes unwittingly ran down streams of tears.
When Pao-yue saw her crying, his heart was seized with anguish. "What'sit that preys on your mind?" he consequently asked her.
Hsi Jen strained every nerve to smile. "There's no rhyme or reason foranything," she replied, "so what can it be?"
Pao-yue's intention was to there and then give orders to the servant towarm some white wine and to ask them for a few 'Li-T'ung' pillscompounded with goat's blood, but Hsi Jen clasped his hand tight. "Mytroubling you is of no matter," she smiled, "but were I to put ever somany people to inconvenience, they'll bear me a grudge for my impudence.Not a soul, it's clear enough, knows anything about it now, but were youto make such a bustle as to bring it to people's notice, you'll be in anawkward fix, and so will I. The proper thing, therefore, is for you tosend a page to-morrow to request Dr. Wang to prepare some medicine forme. When I take this I shall be all right. And as neither any humanbeing nor spirit will thus get wind of it, won't it be better?"
Pao-yue found her suggestion so full of reason that he thought himselfobliged to abandon his purpose; so approaching the table, he poured acup of tea, and came over and gave it to Hsi Jen to rinse her mouthwith. Aware, however, as Hsi Jen was that Pao-yue himself was not feelingat ease in his mind, she was on the point of bidding him not wait uponher; but convinced that he would once more be certain not to accede toher wishes, and that the others would, in the second place, have to bedisturbed, she deemed it expedient to humour him. Leaning on the couch,she consequently allowed Pao-yue to come and attend to her.
As soon as the fifth watch struck, Pao-yue, unmindful of combing orwashing, hastily put on his clothes and left the room; and sending forWang Chi-jen, he personally questioned him with all minuteness about herailment.
Wang Chi-jen asked how it had come about. "It's simply a bruise; nothingmore," (he said), and forthwith he gave him the names of some pills andmedicines, and told him how they were to be taken, and how they were tobe applied.
Pao-yue committed every detail to memory, and on his return into thegarden, the treatment was, needless for us to explain, taken in hand instrict compliance with the directions.
This was the day of the dragon-boat festival. Cat-tail and artemisiawere put over the doors. Tiger charms were suspended on every back. Atnoon, Madame Wang got a banquet ready, and to this midday feast, sheinvited the mother, daughter and the rest of the members of the Hsueehhousehold.
Pao-yue noticed that Pao-ch'ai was in such low spirits that she would noteven speak to him, and concluded that the reason was to be sought in theincident of the previous day. Madame Wang seeing Pao-yue in a sullenhumour jumped at the surmise that it must be due to Chin Ch'uan's affairof the day before; and so ill at ease did she feel that she heeded himless than ever. Lin Tai-yue, detected Pao-yue's apathy, and presumed thathe was out of sorts for having given umbrage to Pao-ch'ai, and hermanner likewise assumed a listless air. Lady Feng had, in the course ofthe previous evening, been told by Madame Wang what had taken placebetween Pao-yue and Chin Ch'uan, and when she came to know that MadameWang was in an unhappy frame of mind she herself did not venture to chator laugh, but at once regulated her behaviour to suit Madame Wang'smood. So the lack of animation became more than ever perceptible; forthe good cheer of Ying Ch'un and her sisters was also damped by thesight of all of them down in the mouth. The natural consequencetherefore was that they all left after a very short stay.
Lin Tai-yue had a natural predilection for retirement. She did not carefor social gatherings. Her notions, however, were not entirely devoid ofreason. She maintained that people who gathered together must soon part;that when they came together, they were full of rejoicing, but did theynot feel lonely when they broke up? That since this sense of lonelinessgave rise to chagrin, it was consequently preferable not to have anygatherings. That flowers afforded an apt example. When they opened, theywon people's admiration; but when they faded, they added to the feelingof vexation; so that better were it if they did not blossom at all! Tothis cause therefore must be assigned the fact that when other peoplewere glad, she, on the contrary, felt unhappy.
Pao-yue's disposition was such that he simply yearned for frequentgatherings, and looked forward with sorrow to the breaking up which musttoo soon come round. As for flowers, he wished them to bloom repeatedlyand was haunted with the dread of their dying in a little time. Yetalbeit manifold anguish fell to his share when banquets drew to a closeand flowers began to fade, he had no alternative but to practiceresignation.
On this account was it that, when the company cheerlessly broke up fromthe present feast, Lin Tai-yue did not mind the separation; and thatPao-yue experienced such melancholy and depression, that, on his returnto his apartments, he gave way to deep groans and frequent sighs.
Ch'ing Wen, as it happened, came to the upper quarters to change hercostume. In an unguarded moment, she let her fan slip out of her handand drop on the ground. As it fell, the bones were snapped. "You stupidthing!" Pao-yue exclaimed, sighing, "what a dunce! what next will you beup to by and bye? When, in a little time, you get married and have ahome of your own, will you, forsooth, still go on in this happy-go-luckycareless sort of way?"
"Master Secundus," replied Ch'ing Wen with a sardonic smile, "yourtemper is of late dreadfully fiery, and time and again it leaks out onyour very face! The other day you even beat Hsi Jen and here you areagain now finding fault with us! If you feel disposed to kick or strikeus, you are at liberty, Sir, to do so at your pleasure; but for a fan toslip on the ground is an everyday occurrence! How many of those crystaljars and cornelian bowls were smashed the other time, I don't remember,and yet you were not seen to fly into a tantrum; and now, for a fan doyou distress yourself so? What's the use of it? If you dislike us, wellpack us off and select some good girls to serve you, and we will quietlygo away. Won't this be better?"
This rejoinder so exasperated Pao-yue that his whole frame trembledviolently. "You needn't be in a hurry!" he then shouted. "There will bea day of parting by and bye."
Hsi Jen was on the other side, and from an early period she listened tothe conversation between them. Hurriedly crossing over, "what are you upto again?" she said to Pao-yue, "why, there's nothing to put your monkeyup! I'm perfectly right in my assertion that when I'm away for anylength of time, something is sure to happen."
Ch'ing Wen heard these remarks. "Sister," she interposed smilingironically, "since you've got the gift of the gab, you should have comeat once; you would then have spared your master his fit of anger. It'syou who have from bygone days up to the present waited upon master;we've never had anything to do with attending on him; and it's becauseyou've served him so faithfully that he repaid you yesterday with a kickon the stomach. But who knows what punishment mayn't be in store for us,who aren't fit to wait upon him decently!"
At these insinuations, Hsi Jen felt both incensed and ashamed. She wasabout to make some response but Pao-yue had worked himself into suchanother passion as to get quite yellow in the face, and she was obligedto rein in her temper. Pushing Ch'ing Wen, "Dear sister," she cried,"you had better be off for a stroll! it's really we, who are to blame!"
The very mention of the word "we" made it certain to Ch'ing Wen that sheimplied herself and Pao-yue, and thus unawares more fuel was added againto her jealous notions. Giving way to several loud smiles, full ofirony: "I can't make out," she insinuated, "who you may mean. But don'tmake me blush on your account! Even those devilish pranks of yours can'thoodwink me! How and why is it that you've started styling yourself as'we?' Properly speaking, you haven't as yet so much as attained thedesignation of 'Miss!' You're simply no better than I am, and how is itthen that you presume so high as to call yourself 'we.'"
Hsi Jen's face grew purple from shame. "The fact is," she reflected,"that I've said more than I should."
"As one and all of you are ever bearing her malice," Pao-yuesimultaneously observed, "I'll actually raise her to-morrow to a higherstatus!"
Hsi Jen quickly snatched Pao-yue's hand. "She's a stupid girl," she said,"what's the use of arguing with her? What's more, you've so far bornewith them and overlooked ever, so many other things more grievous thanthis; and what are you up to to-day?"
"If I'm really a stupid girl," repeated Ch'ing Wen, smilingsarcastically, "am I a fit person for you to hold converse with? Why,I'm purely and simply a slave-girl; that's all."
"Are you, after all," cried Hsi Jen, at these words, "bickering with me,or with Master Secundus? If you bear me a grudge, you'd better thenaddress your remarks to me alone; albeit it isn't right that you shouldkick up such a hullaballoo in the presence of Mr. Secundus. But if youhave a spite against Mr. Secundus, you shouldn't be shouting soboisterously as to make thousands of people know all about it! I camein, a few minutes back, merely for the purpose of setting matters right,and of urging you to make up your quarrels so that we should all be onthe safe side; and here I have the unlucky fate of being set upon byyou, Miss! Yet you neither seem to be angry with me, nor with Mr.Secundus! But armed _cap-a-pie_ as you appear to be, what is yourultimate design? I won't utter another word, but let you have your say!"
While she spoke, she was hurriedly wending her way out.
"You needn't raise your dander." Pao-yue remarked to Ch'ing Wen. "I'veguessed the secret of your heart, so I'll go and tell mother that asyou've also attained a certain age, she should send you away. Will thisplease you, yes or no?"
This allusion made Ch'ing Wen unwittingly feel again wounded at heart.She tried to conceal her tears. "Why should I go away?" she asked. "Ifeven you be so prejudiced against me as to try and devise means to packme off, you won't succeed."
"I never saw such brawling!" Pao-yue exclaimed. "You're certainly bentupon going! I might as well therefore let mother know so as to bundleyou off!"
While addressing her, he rose to his feet and was intent upon trudgingoff at once. Hsi Jen lost no time in turning round and impeding hisprogress. "Where are you off to?" she cried.
"I'm going to tell mother," answered Pao-yue.
"It's no use whatever!" Hsi Jen smiled, "you may be in real earnest togo and tell her, but aren't you afraid of putting her to shame? If evenshe positively means to leave, you can very well wait until you two havegot over this bad blood. And when everything is past and gone, it won'tbe any too late for you to explain, in the course of conversation, thewhole case to our lady, your mother. But if you now go in hot haste andtell her, as if the matter were an urgent one, won't you be the means ofmaking our mistress give way to suspicion?"
"My mother," demurred Pao-yue, "is sure not to entertain any suspicions,as all I will explain to her is that she insists upon leaving."
"When did I ever insist upon going?" sobbed Ch'ing Wen. "You fly into arage, and then you have recourse to threats to intimidate me. But you'reat liberty to go and say anything you like; for as I'll knock my brainsout against the wall, I won't get alive out of this door."
"This is, indeed, strange!" exclaimed Pao-yue. "If you won't go, what'sthe good of all this fuss? I can't stand this bawling, so it will be ariddance if you would get out of the way!"
Saying this, he was resolved upon going to report the matter. Hsi Jenfound herself powerless to dissuade him. She had in consequence no otherresource but to fall on her knees.
Pi Hen, Ch'iu Wen, She Yueeh and the rest of the waiting-maids hadrealised what a serious aspect the dispute had assumed, and not a soundwas to be heard to fall from their lips. They remained standing outsidelistening to what was going on. When they now overheard Hsi Jen makingsolicitous entreaties on her knees, they rushed into the apartment in abody; and with one consent they prostrated themselves on the floor.
Pao-yue at once pulled Hsi Jen up. Then with a sigh, he took a seat onthe bed. "Get up," he shouted to the body of girls, "and clear out! Whatwould you have me do?" he asked, addressing himself to Hsi Jen. "Thisheart of mine has been rent to pieces, and no one has any idea aboutit!"
While speaking, tears of a sudden rolled down his cheek. At the sight ofPao-yue weeping, Hsi Jen also melted into a fit of crying. Ch'ing Wen wasstanding by them, with watery eyes. She was on the point of reasoningwith them, when espying Lin Tai-yue step into the room, she speedilywalked out.
"On a grand holiday like this," remonstrated Lin Tai-yue smiling, "how isit that you're snivelling away, and all for nothing? Is it likely thathigh words have resulted all through that 'dumpling' contest?"
Pao-yue and Lin Tai-yue blurted out laughing.
"You don't tell me, cousin Secundus," Lin Tai-yue put in, "but I know allabout it, even though I have asked no questions."
Now she spoke, and now she patted Hsi Jen on the shoulder. "My dearsister-in-law," she smiled, "just you tell me! It must surely be thatyou two have had a quarrel. Confide in me, your cousin, so that I mightreconcile you."
"Miss Lin," rejoined Hsi Jen, pushing her off, "what are you fussingabout? I am simply one of our servant-girls; you're therefore rathererratic in your talk!"
"You say that you're only a servant-girl," smilingly replied Tai-yue,"and yet I treat you like a sister-in-law."
"Why do you," Pao-yue chimed in, "give her this abusive epithet? Buthowever much she may make allowance for this, can she, when there are somany others who tell idle tales on her account, put up with your comingand telling her all you've said?"
"Miss Lin," smiled Hsi Jen, "you're not aware of the purpose of myheart. Unless my breath fails and I die, I shall continue in hisservice."
"If you die," remarked Lin Tai-yue smiling, "what will others do, Iwonder? As for me, I shall be the first to die from crying."
"Were you to die," added Pao-yue laughingly, "I shall become a bonze."
"You'd better be a little more sober-minded!" laughed Hsi Jen. "What'sthe good of coming out with all these things?"
Lin Tai-yue put out two of her fingers, and puckered up her lips. "Up tothis," she laughed, "he's become a bonze twice. Henceforward, I'll tryand remember how many times you make up your mind to become a Buddhistpriest!"
This reminded Pao-yue that she was referring to a remark he had made on aprevious occasion, but smiling to himself, he allowed the matter todrop.
After a short interval, Lin Tai-yue went away. A servant then came toannounce that Mr. Hsueeh wanted to see him, and Pao-yue had to go. Thepurpose of this visit was in fact to invite him to a banquet, and as hecould not very well put forward any excuse to refuse, he had to remaintill the end of the feast before he was able to take his leave. Theresult was that, on his return, in the evening, he was to a great extentunder the effect of wine. With bustling step, he wended his way into hisown court. Here he perceived that the cool couch with a back to it, hadalready been placed in the yard, and that there was some one asleep onit. Prompted by the conviction that it must be Hsi Jen, Pao-yue seatedhimself on the edge of the couch. As he did so, he gave her a push, andinquired whether her sore place was any better. But thereupon he saw theoccupant turn herself round, and exclaim: "What do you come again toirritate me for?"
Pao-yue, at a glance, realised that it was not Hsi Jen, but Ch'ing Wen.Pao-yue then clutched her and compelled her to sit next to him. "Yourdisposition," he smiled, "has been more and more spoilt throughindulgence. When you let the fan drop this morning, I simply made one ortwo remarks, and out you came with that long rigmarole. Had you gone forme it wouldn't have mattered; but you also dragged in Hsi Jen, who onlyinterfered with every good intention of inducing us to make it up again.But, ponder now, ought you to have done it; yes or no?"
"With this intense heat," remonstrated Ch'ing Wen, "why do you pull meand toss me about? Should any people see you, what will they think? Butthis person of mine isn't meet to be seated in here."
"Since you yourself know that it isn't meet," replied Pao-yue with asmile, "why then were you sleeping here?"
To this taunt Ch'ing Wen had nothing to say. But she spurted out intofresh laughter. "It was all right," she retorted, "during your absence;but the moment you come, it isn't meet for me to stay! Get up and let mego and have my bath. Hsi Jen and She Yueeh have both had theirs, so I'llcall them here!"
"I've just had again a good deal of wine," remarked Pao-yue, laughingly;"so a wash will be good for me. And since you've not had your bath, youhad better bring the water and let's both have it together."
"No, no!" smiled Ch'ing Wen, waving her hand, "I cannot presume to putyou to any trouble, Sir. I still remember how when Pi Hen used to lookafter your bath you occupied fully two or three hours. What you were upto during that time we never knew. We could not very well walk in. Whenyou had however done washing, and we entered your room, we found thefloor so covered with water that the legs of the bed were soaking andthe matting itself a regular pool. Nor could we make out what kind ofwashing you'd been having; and for days afterwards we had a laugh overit. But I've neither any time to get the water ready; nor do I see theneed for you to have a wash along with me. Besides, to-day it's chilly,and as you've had a bath only a little while back, you can very welljust now dispense with one. But I'll draw a basin of water for you towash your face, and to shampoo your head with. Not long ago, Yuean Yangsent you a few fruits; they were put in that crystal bowl, so you'dbetter tell them to bring them to you to taste."
"Well, in that case." laughed Pao-yue, "you needn't also have a bath.Just simply wash your hands, and bring the fruit and let's have sometogether."
"I'm so shaky," smiled Ch'ing Wen "that even fans slip out of my hands,and how could I fetch the fruit for you. Were I also to break the dish,it will be still more dreadful!"
"If you want to break it, break it!" smiled Pao-yue. "These things areonly intended for general use. You like this thing; I fancy that; ourrespective tastes are not identical. The original use of that fan, forinstance, was to fan one's self with; but if you chose to break it forfun, you were quite at liberty to do so. The only thing is, when you getangry don't make it the means of giving vent to your temper! Just likethose salvers. They are really meant for serving things in. But if youfancy that kind of sound, then deliberately smash them, that will be allright. But don't, when you are in high dudgeon avail yourself of them toair your resentment! That's what one would call having a fancy for athing!"
Ch'ing Wen greeted his words with a smile.
"Since that be so," she said, "bring me your fan and let me tear it.What most takes my fancy is tearing!"
Upon hearing this Pao-yue smilingly handed it to her. Ch'ing Wen, inpoint of fact, took it over, and with a crash she rent it in two. Closeupon this, the sound of crash upon crash became audible.
Pao-yue was standing next to her. "How nice the noise is!" he laughed."Tear it again and make it sound a little more!"
But while he spoke, She Yueeh was seen to walk in. "Don't," she smiled,"be up to so much mischief!" Pao-yue, however, went up to her andsnatching her fan also from her hand, he gave it to Ch'ing Wen. Ch'ingWen took it and there and then likewise broke it in two. Both he and shethen had a hearty laugh.
"What do you call this?" She Yueeh expostulated. "Do you take my propertyand make it the means of distracting yourselves!"
"Open the fan-box," shouted Pao-yue, "and choose one and take it away!What, are they such fine things!"
"In that case," ventured She Yueeh, "fetch the fans and let her break asmany as she can. Won't that be nice!"
"Go and bring them at once!" Pao-yue laughed.
"I won't be up to any such tomfoolery!" She Yueeh demurred. "She hasn'tsnapped her hands, so bid her go herself and fetch them!"
"I'm feeling tired," interposed Ch'ing Wen, as she laughingly leant onthe bed. "I'll therefore tear some more to-morrow again."
"An old writer says," added Pao-yue with a smile, "'that a thousandounces of gold cannot purchase a single laugh'! What can a few fanscost?"
After moralising, he went on to call Hsi Jen. Hsi Jen had just finishedthe necessary change in her dress so she stepped in; and a youngservant-girl, Chiao Hui, crossed over and picked up the broken fans.Then they all sat and enjoyed the cool breeze. But we can well dispensewith launching into any minute details.
On the morrow, noon found Madame Wang, Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai, Lin Tai-yue, andthe rest of the young ladies congregated in dowager lady Chia's suite ofrooms. Some one then brought the news that: "Miss Shih had arrived." Ina little time they perceived Shih Hsiang-yun make her appearance in thecourt, at the head of a bevy of waiting-maids and married women.Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yu and her other cousins, quickly ran down the steps tomeet her and exchange greetings. But with what fervour girls of tenderyears re-unite some day after a separation of months need not, ofcourse, be explained. Presently, she entered the apartments, paid herrespects and inquired how they all were. But after this conventionalinterchange of salutations, old lady Chia pressed her to take off herouter garments as the weather was so close. Shih Hsiang-yuen lost no timein rising to her feet and loosening her clothes. "I don't see why,"Madame Wang thereupon smiled, "you wear all these things!'
"It's entirely at aunt Secunda's bidding," retorted Shih Hsiang-yuen,"that I put them on. Why, would any one of her own accord wear so manythings!"
"Aunt," interposed Pao-ch'ai, who stood by, with a smile, "you're notaware that what most delights her in the matter of dress is to don otherpeople's clothes! Yes, I remember how, during her stay here in the thirdand fourth moons of last year, she used to wear cousin Pao's pelisses.She even put on his shoes, and attached his frontlets as well round herhead. At a casual glance, she looked the very image of cousin Pao; whatwas superfluous was that pair of earrings of hers. As she stood at theback of that chair she so thoroughly took in our venerable ancestor thatshe kept on shouting: 'Pao-yue, come over! Mind the tassels suspended onthat lamp; for if you shake the dust off, it may get into your eyes!'But all she did was to laugh; she did not budge; and it was only afterevery one found it hard to keep their countenance that our worthy senioralso started laughing. 'You do look well in male habiliments!' she saidto her."
"What about that!" cried Lin Tai-yue, "why, she had scarcely been herewith us a couple of days in the first moon of last year, when we sentand fetched her, that we had a fall of snow. You, venerable senior, andher maternal aunt had on that day, I remember so well, just returnedfrom worshipping the images of our ancestors, and a brand-new deep redfelt wrapper of yours, dear grandmother, had been lying over there, whensuddenly it disappeared. But, lo, she it was who had put it on! Being,however, too large and too long for her, she took a couple ofhandkerchiefs, and fastened them round her waist. She was then trudginginto the back court with the servant-girls to make snow men when shetripped and fell flat in front of the drain, and got covered all overwith mud."
As she narrated this incident, every one recalled the circumstances tomind, and had a good laugh.
"Dame Chou," Pao-ch'ai smilingly inquired of nurse Chou, "is your younglady always as fond of pranks as ever or not?"
Nurse Chou then also gave a laugh.
"Pranks are nothing," Ying Ch'un smiled. "What I do detest is herfondness for tittle-tattle! I've never seen any one who, even whenasleep, goes on chatter-chatter; now laughing, and now talking, as shedoes. Nor can I make out where she gets all those idle yarns of hers."
"I think she's better of late," interposed Madame Wang. "The other daysome party or other came and they met; so she's to have a mother-in-lawvery soon; and can she still be comporting herself like that!"
"Are you going to stay to-day," dowager lady Chia then asked, "or goingback home?"
Nurse Chou smiled. "Your venerable ladyship has not seen what an amountof clothes we've brought," she replied. "We mean, of course, to stay acouple of days."
"Is cousin Pao-yue not at home?" inquired Hsiang-yuen."
"There she's again! She doesn't think of others," remarked Pao-ch'aismiling significantly. "She only thinks of her cousin Pao-yue. They'reboth so fond of larks! This proves that she hasn't yet got rid of thatspirit of mischief."
"You're all now grown up," observed old lady Chia; "and you shouldn'tallude to infant names."
But while she was chiding them, they noticed Pao-yue arrive.
"Cousin Yuen, have you come?" he smiled. "How is it that you wouldn'tcome the other day when some one was despatched to fetch you?"
"It's only a few minutes," Madame Wang said, "since our venerable seniorcalled that one to task, and now here he comes and refers to names andsurnames!"
"Your cousin Pao," ventured Lin Tai-yue, "has something good, which hehas been waiting to give you."
"What good thing is it?" asked Hsiang-yuen.
"Do you believe what she says?" observed Pao-yue laughingly. "But howmany days is it that I have not seen you, and you've grown so muchtaller!"
"Is cousin Hsi Jen all right?" inquired Hsiang-yuen.
"She's all right," answered Pao-yue. "Many thanks for your kind thoughtof her."
"I've brought something nice for her," resumed Hsiang-yuen.
Saying this, she produced her handkerchief, tied into a knot.
"What's this something nice?" asked Pao-yue. "Wouldn't it have beenbetter if you'd brought her a couple of those rings with streaked stonesof the kind you sent the other day?"
"Why, what's this?" exclaimed Hsiang-yuen laughing, opening, as shespoke, the handkerchief.
On close scrutiny, they actually found four streaked rings, similar tothose she had previously sent, tied up in the same packet.
"Look here!" Lin Tai-yue smiled, "what a girl she is! Had you, whensending that fellow the other day to bring ours, given him these also tobring along with him, wouldn't it have saved trouble? Instead of that,here you fussily bring them yourself to-day! I presumed that it wassomething out of the way again; but is it really only these things? Invery truth, you're a mere dunce!"
"It's you who behave like a dunce now!" Shih Hsiang-yuen smiled.
"I'll speak out here and let every one judge for themselves who is thedunce. The servant, deputed to bring the things to you, had no need toopen his mouth and say anything; for, as soon as they were brought in,it was of course evident, at a glance, that they were to be presented toyou young ladies. But had he been the bearer of these things for them, Iwould have been under the necessity of explaining to him which wasintended for this servant-girl, and which for that. Had the messengerhad his wits about him, well and good; but had he been at all stupid hewouldn't have been able to remember so much as the names of the girls!He would have made an awful mess of it, and talked a lot of nonsense. Soinstead of being of any use he would have even muddled,hickledy-pickledy, your things. Had a female servant been despatched, itwould have been all right. But as it happened, a servant-boy was againsent the other day, so how could he have mentioned the names of thewaiting-girls? And by my bringing them in person to give them to them,doesn't it make things clearer?"
As she said this, she put down the four rings. "One is for sister HsiJen," she continued, "one is for sister Yuean Yang. One for sister ChinCh'uan-erh, and one for sister P'ing Erh. They are only for these fourgirls; but would the servant-boys too forsooth have remembered them soclearly!"
At these words, the whole company smiled. "How really clear!" theycried.
"This is what it is to be able to speak!" Pao-yue put in. "She doesn'tspare any one!"
Hearing this, Lin Tai-yue gave a sardonic smile. "If she didn't know howto use her tongue," she observed, "would she deserve to wear thatunicorn of gold!"
While speaking, she rose and walked off.
Luckily, every one did not hear what she said. Only Hsueeh Pao-ch'aipursed up her lips and laughed. Pao-yue, however, had overheard herremark, and he blamed himself for having once more talked in a heedlessmanner. Unawares his eye espied Pao-ch'ai much amused, and he too couldnot suppress a smile. But at the sight of Pao-yue in laughter, Pao-ch'aihastily rose to her feet and withdrew. She went in search of Tai-yue, tohave a chat and laugh with her.
"After you've had tea," old lady Chia thereupon said to Hsiang-yuen,"you'd better rest a while and then go and see your sisters-in-law.Besides, it's cool in the garden, so you can walk about with yourcousins."
Hsiang-yuen expressed her assent, and, collecting the three rings, shewrapped them up, and went and lay down to rest. Presently, she got upwith the idea of paying visits to lady Feng and her other relatives.Followed by a whole bevy of nurses and waiting-maids, she repaired intolady Feng's quarters on the off side. She bandied words with her for awhile and then coming out she betook herself into the garden of BroadVista, and called on Li Kung-ts'ai. But after a short visit, she turnedher steps towards the I Hung court to look up Hsi Jen. "You peopleneedn't," she said, turning her head round, "come along with me! You maygo and see your friends and relatives. It will be quite enough if yousimply leave Ts'ui Lue to wait upon me."
Hearing her wishes, each went her own way in quest of aunts, orsisters-in-law. There only remained but Hsiang-yuen and Ts'ui Lue.
"How is it," inquired Ts'ui Lue, "that these lotus flowers have not yetopened?"
"The proper season hasn't yet arrived," rejoined Shih Hsiang-yuen.
"They too," continued Ts'ui Lue, "resemble those in our pond; they aredouble flowers."
"These here," remarked Hsiang-yuen, "are not however up to ours."
"They have over there," observed Ts'ui Lue, "a pomegranate tree, withfour or five branches joined one to another, just like one storey raisedabove another storey. What trouble it must have cost them to rear!"
"Flowers and plants," suggested Shih Hsiang-yuen, "are precisely like thehuman race. With sufficient vitality, they grow up in a healthycondition."
"I can't credit these words," replied Ts'ui Lue, twisting her face round."If you maintain that they are like human beings, how is it that Ihaven't seen any person, with one head growing over another."
This rejoinder evoked a smile from Hsiang-yuen. "I tell you not to talk,"she cried, "but you will insist upon talking! How do you expect peopleto be able to answer every thing you say! All things, whether in heavenor on earth come into existence by the co-operation of the dual powers,the male and female. So all things, whether good or bad, novel orstrange, and all those manifold changes and transformations ariseentirely from the favourable or adverse influence exercised by the maleand female powers. And though some things seldom seen by mankind mightcome to life, the principle at work is, after all, the same."
"In the face of these arguments," laughed Ts'ui Lue, "everything, fromold till now, from the very creation itself, embodies a certainproportion of the Yin and Yang principles."
"You stupid thing!" exclaimed Hsiang-yuen smiling, "the more you talk,the more stuff and nonsense falls from your lips! What about everythingembodying a certain proportion of the principles Yin and Yang! Besides,the two words Yin and Yang are really one word; for when the Yangprinciple is exhausted, it becomes the Yin; and when the Yin isexhausted, it becomes Yang. And it isn't that, at the exhaustion of theYin, another Yang comes into existence; and that, at the exhaustion ofthe Yang, a second Yin arises."
"This trash is sufficient to kill me!" ejaculated Ts'ui Lue. "What arethe Yin and Yang? Why, they are without substance or form! But pray,Miss, tell me what sort of things these Yin and Yang can be!"
"The Yin and Yang," explained Hsiang-yuen, "are no more than spirits, butanything affected by their influence at once assumes form. The heavens,for instance, are Yang, and the earth is Yin; water is Yin and fire isYang; the sun is Yang and the moon Yin."
"Quite so! quite so!" cried out Ts'ui Lue, much amused by theseexplanations, "I've at length attained perception! It isn't strange thenthat people invariably call the sun 'T'ai-yang.' While astrologers keepon speaking of the moon as 'T'ai-yin-hsing,' or something like it. Itmust be on account of this principle."
"O-mi-to-fu!" laughed Hsiang-yuen, "you have at last understood!"
"All these things possess the Yin and Yang; that's all right." T'sui Lueput in. "But is there any likelihood that all those mosquitoes, fleesand worms, flowers, herbs, bricks and tiles have, in like manner,anything to do with the Yin and Yang?"
"How don't they!" exclaimed Hsiang-yuen. "For example, even the leaves ofthat tree are distinguished by Yin and Yang. The side, which looks upand faces the sun, is called Yang; while that in the shade and lookingdownwards, is called Yin."
"Is it really so!" ejaculated T'sui Lue, upon hearing this; while shesmiled and nodded her head. "Now I know all about it! But which is Yangand which Yin in these fans we're holding."
"This side, the front, is Yang," answered Hsiang-yuen; "and that, thereverse, is Yin."
Ts'ui Lue went on to nod her head, and to laugh. She felt inclined toapply her questions to several other things, but as she could not fixher mind upon anything in particular, she, all of a sudden, drooped herhead. Catching sight of the pendant in gold, representing a unicorn,which Hsiang-yuen had about her person, she forthwith made allusion toit. "This, Miss," she said smiling, "cannot likely also have any Yin andYang!"
"The beasts of the field and the birds of the air," proceededHsiang-yuen, "are, the cock birds, Yang, and the hen birds, Yin. Thefemales of beasts are Yin; and the males, Yang; so how is there none?"
"Is this male, or is this female?" inquired Ts'ui Lue.
"Ts'ui!" exclaimed Hsiang-yuen, "what about male and female! Here you arewith your nonsense again."
"Well, never mind about that," added Ts'ui Lue, "But how is it that allthings have Yin and Yang, and that we human beings have no Yin and noYang?"
Hsiang-yuen then lowered her face. "You low-bred thing!" she exclaimed."But it's better for us to proceed on our way, for the more questionsyou ask, the nicer they get."
"What's there in this that you can't tell me?" asked Ts'ui Lue, "But Iknow all about it, so there's no need for you to keep me on pins andneedles."
Hsiang-yuen blurted out laughing. "What do you know?" she said.
"That you, Miss, are Yang, and that I'm Yin," answered Ts'ui Lue.
Hsiang-yuen produced her handkerchief, and, while screening her mouthwith it, burst out into a loud fit of laughter.
"What I say must be right for you to laugh in this way," Ts'ui Lueobserved.
"Perfectly right, perfectly right!" acquiesced Hsiang-yuen.
"People say," continued Ts'ui Lue, "that masters are Yang, and thatservant-girls are Yin; don't I even apprehend this primary principle?"
"You apprehend it thoroughly," responded Hsiang-yuen laughingly. Butwhile she was speaking, she espied, under the trellis with the cinnamonroses, something glistening like gold. "Do you see that? What is it?"Hsiang-yuen asked pointing at it.
Hearing this, Ts'ui Lue hastily went over and picked up the object. Whilescrutinising it, she observed with a smile, "Let us find out whetherit's Yin or Yang!"
So saying, she first laid hold of the unicorn, belonging to ShihHsiang-yuen, and passed it under inspection.
Shih Hsiang-yuen longed to be shown what she had picked up, but Ts'ui Luewould not open her hand.
"It's a precious gem," she smiled. "You mayn't see it, Miss. Where canit be from? How very strange it is! I've never seen any one in here withanything of the kind."
"Give it to me and let me look at it," retorted Hsiang-yuen.
Ts'ui Lue stretched out her hand with a dash. "Yes, Miss, please look atit!" she laughed.
Hsiang-yuen raised her eyes. She perceived, at a glance, that it was agolden unicorn, so beautiful and so bright; and so much larger andhandsomer than the one she had on. Hsiang-yuen put out her arm and,taking the gem in the palm of her hand, she fell into a silent reverieand uttered not a word. She was quite absent-minded when suddenly Pao-yueappeared in the opposite direction.
"What are you two," he asked smiling, "doing here in the sun? How is ityou don't go and find Hsi Jen?"
Shih Hsiang-yuen precipitately concealed the unicorn. "We were justgoing," she replied, "so let us all go together."
Conversing, they, in a company, wended their steps into the I Hungcourt. Hsi Jen was leaning on the balustrade at the bottom of the steps,her face turned to the breeze. Upon unexpectedly seeing Hsiang-yuenarrive she with alacrity rushed down to greet her; and taking her handin hers, they cheerfully canvassed the events that had transpired duringtheir separation, while they entered the room and took a seat.
"You should have come earlier," Pao-yue said. "I've got something niceand was only waiting for you."
Saying this, he searched and searched about his person. After a longinterval, "Ai-ya!" he ejaculated. "Have you perchance put that thingaway?" he eagerly asked Hsi Jen.
"What thing?" inquired Hsi Jen.
"The unicorn," explained Pao-yue, "I got the other day."
"You've daily worn it about you, and how is it you ask me?" remarked HsiJen.
As soon as her answer fell on his ear, Pao-yue clapped his hands. "I'velost it!" he cried. "Where can I go and look for it!" There and then, hemeant to go and search in person; but Shih Hsiang-yuen heard hisinquiries, and concluded that it must be he who had lost the gem. "Whendid you too," she promptly smiled, "get a unicorn?"
"I got it the other day, after ever so much trouble;" rejoined Pao-yue,"but I can't make out when I can have lost it! I've also become quiteaddle-headed."
"Fortunately," smiled Shih Hsiang-yuen, "it's only a sort of a toy!Still, are you so careless?" While speaking, she flung open her hand."Just see," she laughed, "is it this or not?"
As soon as he saw it, Pao-yue was seized with unwonted delight. But,reader, if you care to know the cause of his delight, peruse theexplanation contained in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XXXII.
  Hsi Jen and Hsiang-yuen tell their secret thoughts.  Tai-yue is infatuated with the living Pao-yue.
While trying to conceal her sense of shame and injury Chin Ch'uan isdriven by her impetuous feelings to seek death.
But to resume our narrative. At the sight of the unicorn, Pao-yue wasfilled with intense delight. So much so, that he forthwith put out hishand and made a grab for it. "Lucky enough it was you who picked it up!"he said, with a face beaming with smiles. "But when did you find it?"
"Fortunately it was only this!" rejoined Shih Hsiang-yuen laughing. "Ifyou by and bye also lose your seal, will you likely banish it at oncefrom your mind, and never make an effort to discover it?"
"After all," smiled Pao-yue, "the loss of a seal is an ordinaryoccurrence. But had I lost this, I would have deserved to die."
Hsi Jen then poured a cup of tea and handed it to Shih Hsiang-yuen. "MissSenior," she remarked smilingly, "I heard that you had occasion theother day to be highly pleased."
Shih Hsiang-yuen flushed crimson. She went on drinking her tea and didnot utter a single word.
"Here you are again full of shame!" Hsi Jen smiled. "But do you rememberwhen we were living, about ten years back, in those warm rooms on thewest side and you confided in me one evening, you didn't feel any shamethen; and how is it you blush like this now?"
"Do you still speak about that!" exclaimed Shih Hsiang-yuen laughingly."You and I were then great friends. But when our mother subsequentlydied and I went home for a while, how is it you were at once sent to bewith my cousin Secundus, and that now that I've come back you don'ttreat me as you did once?"
"Are you yet harping on this!" retorted Hsi Jen, putting on a smile."Why, at first, you used to coax me with a lot of endearing terms tocomb your hair and to wash your face, to do this and that for you. Butnow that you've become a big girl, you assume the manner of a youngmistress towards me, and as you put on these airs of a young mistress,how can I ever presume to be on a familiar footing with you?"
"O-mi-to-fu," cried Shih Hsiang-yuen. "What a false accusation! If I beguilty of anything of the kind, may I at once die! Just see what abroiling hot day this is, and yet as soon as I arrived I felt bound tocome and look you up first. If you don't believe me, well, ask Lue Erh!And while at home, when did I not at every instant say something aboutyou?"
Scarcely had she concluded than Hsi Jen and Pao-yue tried to soothe her."We were only joking," they said, "but you've taken everything again asgospel. What! are you still so impetuous in your temperament!"
"You don't say," argued Shih Hsiang-yuen, "that your words are hardthings to swallow, but contrariwise, call people's temperamentsimpetuous!"
As she spoke, she unfolded her handkerchief and, producing a ring, shegave it to Hsi Jen.
Hsi Jen did not know how to thank her enough. "When;" she consequentlysmiled, "you sent those to your cousin the other day, I got one also;and here you yourself bring me another to-day! It's clear enoughtherefore that you haven't forgotten me. This alone has been quiteenough to test you. As for the ring itself, what is its worth? but it'sa token of the sincerity of your heart!"
"Who gave it to you?" inquired Shih Hsiang-yuen.
"Miss Pao let me have it." replied Hsi Jen.
"I was under the impression," remarked Hsiang-yuen with a sigh, "that itwas a present from cousin Lin. But is it really cousin Pao, that gave itto you! When I was at home, I day after day found myself reflecting thatamong all these cousins of mine, there wasn't one able to compare withcousin Pao, so excellent is she. How I do regret that we are not theoffspring of one mother! For could I boast of such a sister of the sameflesh and blood as myself, it wouldn't matter though I had lost bothfather and mother!"
While indulging in these regrets, her eyes got quite red.
"Never mind! never mind!" interposed Pao-yue. "Why need you speak ofthese things!"
"If I do allude to this," answered Shih Hsiang-yuen, "what does itmatter? I know that weak point of yours. You're in fear and tremblinglest your cousin Lin should come to hear what I say, and get angry withme again for eulogising cousin Pao! Now isn't it this, eh!"
"Ch'ih!" laughed Hsi Jen, who was standing by her. "Miss Yuen," she said,"now that you've grown up to be a big girl you've become more than everopenhearted and outspoken."
"When I contend;" smiled Pao-yue, "that it is difficult to say a word toany one of you I'm indeed perfectly correct!"
"My dear cousin," observed Shih Hsiang-yuen laughingly, "don't go on inthat strain! You'll provoke me to displeasure. When you are with me allyou are good for is to talk and talk away; but were you to catch aglimpse of cousin Lin, you would once more be quite at a loss to knowwhat best to do!"
"Now, enough of your jokes!" urged Hsi Jen. "I have a favour to crave ofyou."
"What is it?" vehemently inquired Shih Hsiang-yuen.
"I've got a pair of shoes," answered Hsi Jen, "for which I've stuck thepadding together; but I'm not feeling up to the mark these last fewdays, so I haven't been able to work at them. If you have any leisure,do finish them for me."
"This is indeed strange!" exclaimed Shih Hsiang-yuen. "Putting aside allthe skilful workers engaged in your household, you have besides somepeople for doing needlework and others for tailoring and cutting; andhow is it you appeal to me to take your shoes in hand? Were you to askany one of those men to execute your work, who could very well refuse todo it?"
"Here you are in another stupid mood!" laughed Hsi Jen. "Can it be thatyou don't know that our sewing in these quarters mayn't be done by theseneedleworkers."
At this reply, it at once dawned upon Shih Hsiang-yuen that the shoesmust be intended for Pao-yue. "Since that be the case," she inconsequence smiled; "I'll work them for you. There's however one thing.I'll readily attend to any of yours, but I will have nothing to do withany for other people."
"There you are again!" laughed Hsi Jen. "Who am I to venture to troubleyou to make shoes for me? I'll tell you plainly, however, that they arenot mine. But no matter whose they are, it is anyhow I who'll be therecipient of your favour; that is sufficient."
"To speak the truth," rejoined Shih Hsiang-yuen, "you've put me to thetrouble of working, I don't know how many things for you. The reason whyI refuse on this occasion should be quite evident to you!"
"I can't nevertheless make it out!" answered Hsi Jen.
"I heard the other day," continued Shih Hsiang-yuen, a sardonic smile onher lip, "that while the fan-case, I had worked, was being held andcompared with that of some one else, it too was slashed away in a fit ofhigh dudgeon. This reached my ears long ago, and do you still try todupe me by asking me again now to make something more for you? Have Ireally become a slave to you people?
"As to what occurred the other day," hastily explained Pao-yue smiling,"I positively had no idea that that thing was your handiwork."
"He never knew that you'd done it," Hsi Jen also laughed. "I deceivedhim by telling him that there had been of late some capital hands atneedlework outside, who could execute any embroidery with surpassingbeauty, and that I had asked them to bring a fan-case so as to try themand to see whether they could actually work well or not. He at oncebelieved what I said. But as he produced the case and gave it to thisone and that one to look at, he somehow or other, I don't know how,managed again to put some one's back up, and she cut it into two. On hisreturn, however, he bade me hurry the men to make another; and when atlength I explained to him that it had been worked by you, he felt, Ican't tell you, what keen regret!"
"This is getting stranger and stranger!" said Shih Hsiang-yuen. "Itwasn't worth the while for Miss Lin to lose her temper about it. But asshe plies the scissors so admirably, why, you might as well tell her tofinish the shoes for you."
"She couldn't," replied Hsi Jen, "for besides other things our venerablelady is still in fear and trembling lest she should tire herself in anyway. The doctor likewise says that she will continue to enjoy goodhealth, so long as she is carefully looked after; so who would wish toask her to take them in hand? Last year she managed to just get througha scented bag, after a whole year's work. But here we've already reachedthe middle of the present year, and she hasn't yet taken up any needleor thread!"
In the course of their conversation, a servant came and announced 'thatthe gentleman who lived in the Hsing Lung Street had come.' "Ourmaster," he added, "bids you, Mr. Secundus, come out and greet him."
As soon as Pao-yue heard this announcement, he knew that Chia Yue-ts'unmust have arrived. But he felt very unhappy at heart. Hsi Jen hurried togo and bring his clothes. Pao-yue, meanwhile, put on his boots, but as hedid so, he gave way to resentment. "Why there's father," hesoliloquised, "to sit with him; that should be enough; and must he, onevery visit he pays, insist upon seeing me!"
"It is, of course, because you have such a knack for receiving andentertaining visitors that Mr. Chia Cheng will have you go out,"laughingly interposed Shih Hsiang-yuen from one side, as she waved herfan.
"Is it father's doing?" Pao-yue rejoined. "Why, it's he himself who asksthat I should be sent for to see him."
"'When a host is courteous, visitors come often,'" smiled Hsiang-yuen,"so it's surely because you possess certain qualities, which have wonhis regard, that he insists upon seeing you."
"But I am not what one would call courteous," demurred Pao-yue. "I am, ofall coarse people, the coarsest. Besides, I do not choose to have anyrelations with such people as himself."
"Here's again that unchangeable temperament of yours!" laughedHsiang-yuen. "But you're a big fellow now, and you should at least, ifyou be loth to study and go and pass your examinations for a provincialgraduate or a metropolitan graduate, have frequent intercourse withofficers and ministers of state and discuss those varied attainments,which one acquires in an official career, so that you also may be ablein time to have some idea about matters in general; and that when by andbye you've made friends, they may not see you spending the whole daylong in doing nothing than loafing in our midst, up to every imaginablemischief."
"Miss," exclaimed Pao-yue, after this harangue, "pray go and sit in someother girl's room, for mind one like myself may contaminate a person whoknows so much of attainments and experience as you do."
"Miss," ventured Hsi Jen, "drop this at once! Last time Miss Pao tootendered him this advice, but without troubling himself as to whetherpeople would feel uneasy or not, he simply came out with an ejaculationof 'hai,' and rushed out of the place. Miss Pao hadn't meanwhileconcluded her say, so when she saw him fly, she got so full of shamethat, flushing scarlet, she could neither open her lips, nor hold herown counsel. But lucky for him it was only Miss Pao. Had it been MissLin, there's no saying what row there may not have been again, and whattears may not have been shed! Yet the very mention of all she had totell him is enough to make people look up to Miss Pao with respect. Butafter a time, she also betook herself away. I then felt very unhappy asI imagined that she was angry; but contrary to all my expectations, shewas by and bye just the same as ever. She is, in very truth,long-suffering and indulgent! This other party contrariwise became quitedistant to her, little though one would have thought it of him; and asMiss Pao perceived that he had lost his temper, and didn't choose toheed her, she subsequently made I don't know how many apologies to him."
"Did Miss Lin ever talk such trash!" exclaimed Pao-yue. "Had she evertalked such stuff and nonsense, I would have long ago become chilledtowards her."
"What you say is all trash!" Hsi Jen and Hsiang-yuen remarked with onevoice, while they shook their heads to and fro and smiled.
Lin Tai-yue, the fact is, was well aware that now that Shih Hsiang-yuenwas staying in the mansion, Pao-yue too was certain to hasten to come andtell her all about the unicorn he had got, so she thought to herself:"In the foreign traditions and wild stories, introduced here of late byPao-yue, literary persons and pretty girls are, for the most part,brought together in marriage, through the agency of some trifling butingenious nick-nack. These people either have miniature ducks, orphoenixes, jade necklets or gold pendants, fine handkerchiefs or elegantsashes; and they have, through the instrumentality of such trivialobjects, invariably succeeded in accomplishing the wishes theyentertained throughout their lives." When she recently discovered, bysome unforeseen way, that Pao-yue had likewise a unicorn she began toapprehend lest he should make this circumstance a pretext to create anestrangement with her, and indulge with Shih Hsiang-yuen as well invarious free and easy flirtations and fine doings. She therefore quietlycrossed over to watch her opportunity and take such action as wouldenable her to get an insight into his and her sentiments. Contrary,however, to all her calculations, no sooner did she reach herdestination, than she overheard Shih Hsiang-yuen dilate on the topic ofexperience, and Pao-yue go on to observe: "Cousin Lin has never indulgedin such stuff and nonsense. Had she ever uttered any such trash, I wouldhave become chilled even towards her!" This language suddenly produced,in Lin Tai-yue's mind, both surprise as well as delight; sadness as wellas regret. Delight, at having indeed been so correct in her perceptionthat he whom she had ever considered in the light of a true friend hadactually turned out to be a true friend. Surprise, "because," she saidto herself: "he has, in the presence of so many witnesses, displayedsuch partiality as to speak in my praise, and has shown such affectionand friendliness for me as to make no attempt whatever to shirksuspicion." Regret, "for since," (she pondered), "you are my intimatefriend, you could certainly well look upon me too as your intimatefriend; and if you and I be real friends, why need there be any moretalk about gold and jade? But since there be that question of gold andjade, you and I should have such things in our possession. Yet, whyshould this Pao-ch'ai step in again between us?" Sad, "because," (shereflected), "my father and mother departed life at an early period; andbecause I have, in spite of the secret engraven on my heart andimprinted on my bones, not a soul to act as a mentor to me. Besides, oflate, I continuously feel confusion creep over my mind, so my diseasemust already have gradually developed itself. The doctors further statethat my breath is weak and my blood poor, and that they dread lestconsumption should declare itself, so despite that sincere friendship Ifoster for you, I cannot, I fear, last for very long. You are, I admit,a true friend to me, but what can you do for my unfortunate destiny!"
Upon reaching this point in her reflections, she could not control hertears, and they rolled freely down her cheeks. So much so, that whenabout to enter and meet her cousins, she experienced such utter lack ofzest, that, while drying her tears she turned round, and wended hersteps back in the direction of her apartments.
Pao-yue, meanwhile, had hurriedly got into his new costume. Upon comingout of doors, he caught sight of Lin Tai-yue, walking quietly ahead ofhim engaged, to all appearances, in wiping tears from her eyes. Withrapid stride, he overtook her.
"Cousin Lin," he smiled, "where are you off to? How is it that you'recrying again? Who has once more hurt your feelings?"
Lin Tai-yue turned her head round to look; and seeing that it was Pao-yue,she at once forced a smile. "Why should I be crying," she replied, "whenthere is no reason to do so?"
"Look here!" observed Pao-yue smilingly. "The tears in your eyes are notdry yet and do you still tell me a fib?"
Saying this, he could not check an impulse to raise his arm and wipe hereyes, but Lin Tai-yue speedily withdrew several steps backwards. "Are youagain bent," she said, "upon compassing your own death! Then why do youknock your hands and kick your feet about in this wise?"
"While intent upon speaking, I forgot," smiled Pao-yue, "all aboutpropriety and gesticulated, yet quite inadvertently. But what care Iwhether I die or live!"
"To die would, after all" added Lin Tai-yue, "be for you of no matter;but you'll leave behind some gold or other, and a unicorn too or other;and what would they do?"
This insinuation was enough to plunge Pao-yue into a fresh fit ofexasperation. Hastening up to her: "Do you still give vent to suchlanguage?" he asked. "Why, it's really tantamount to invokingimprecations on me! What, are you yet angry with me!"
This question recalled to Lin Tai-yue's mind the incidents of a few daysback, and a pang of remorse immediately gnawed her heart for having beenagain so indiscreet in her speech. "Now don't you distress your mind!"she observed hastily, smiling. "I verily said what I shouldn't! Yet whatis there in this to make your veins protrude, and to so provoke you asto bedew your whole face with perspiration?"
While reasoning with him, she felt unable to repress herself, and,approaching him, she extended her hand, and wiped the perspiration fromhis face.
Pao-yue gazed intently at her for a long time. "Do set your mind atease!" he at length observed.
At this remark, Lin Tai-yue felt quite nervous. "What's there to make mymind uneasy?" she asked after a protracted interval. "I can't make outwhat you're driving at; tell me what's this about making me easy oruneasy?"
Pao-yue heaved a sigh. "Don't you truly fathom the depth of my words?" heinquired. "Why, do you mean to say that I've throughout made such pooruse of my love for you as not to be able to even divine your feelings?Well, if so, it's no wonder that you daily lose your temper on myaccount!"
"I actually don't understand what you mean by easy or uneasy," LinTai-yue replied.
"My dear girl," urged Pao-yue, nodding and sighing. "Don't be making afool of me! For if you can't make out these words, not only have I everuselessly lavished affection upon you, but the regard, with which youhave always treated me, has likewise been entirely of no avail! And it'smostly because you won't set your mind at ease that your whole frame isriddled with disease. Had you taken things easier a bit, this ailment ofyours too wouldn't have grown worse from day to day!"
These words made Lin Tai-yue feel as if she had been blasted by thunder,or struck by lightning. But after carefully weighing them withinherself, they seemed to her far more fervent than any that might haveemanated from the depths of her own heart, and thousands of sentiments,in fact, thronged together in her mind; but though she had every wish toframe them into language, she found it a hard task to pronounce so muchas half a word. All she therefore did was to gaze at him with vacantstare.
Pao-yue fostered innumerable thoughts within himself, but unable in amoment to resolve from which particular one to begin, he too absentlylooked at Tai-yue. Thus it was that the two cousins remained for a longtime under the spell of a deep reverie.
An ejaculation of "Hai!" was the only sound that issued from LinTai-yue's lips; and while tears streamed suddenly from her eyes, sheturned herself round and started on her way homeward.
Pao-yue jumped forward, with alacrity, and dragged her back. "My dearcousin," he pleaded, "do stop a bit! Let me tell you just one thing;after that, you may go."
"What can you have to tell me?" exclaimed Lin Tai-yue, who while wipingher tears, extricated her hand from his grasp. "I know." she cried, "allyou have to say."
As she spoke, she went away, without even turning her head to cast aglance behind her.
As Pao-yue gazed at her receding figure, he fell into abstraction.
He had, in fact, quitted his apartments a few moments back in suchprecipitate hurry that he had omitted to take a fan with him: and HsiJen, fearing lest he might suffer from the heat, promptly seized one andran to find him and give it to him. But upon casually raising her head,she espied Lin Tai-yue standing with him. After a time, Tai-yue walkedaway; and as he still remained where he was without budging, sheapproached him.
"You left," she said, "without even taking a fan with you. Happily Inoticed it, and so hurried to catch you up and bring it to you."
But Pao-yue was so lost in thought that as soon as he caught Hsi Jen'svoice, he made a dash and clasped her in his embrace, without so much astrying to make sure who she was.
"My dear cousin," he cried, "I couldn't hitherto muster enough courageto disclose the secrets of my heart; but on this occasion I shall makebold and give utterance to them. For you I'm quite ready to even pay thepenalty of death. I have too for your sake brought ailments upon mywhole frame. It's in here! But I haven't ventured to breathe it to anyone. My only alternative has been to bear it patiently, in the hope thatwhen you got all right, I might then perchance also recover. But whetherI sleep, or whether I dream, I never, never forget you."
These declarations quite dumfoundered Hsi Jen. She gave way to incessantapprehensions. All she could do was to shout out: "Oh spirits, ohheaven, oh Buddha, he's compassing my death!" Then pushing him away fromher, "what is it you're saying?" she asked. "May it be that you arepossessed by some evil spirit! Don't you quick get yourself off?"
This brought Pao-yue to his senses at once. He then became aware that itwas Hsi Jen, and that she had come to bring him a fan. Pao-yue wasoverpowered with shame; his whole face was suffused with scarlet; and,snatching the fan out of her hands, he bolted away with rapid stride.
When Hsi Jen meanwhile saw Pao-yue effect his escape, "Lin Tai-yue," shepondered, "must surely be at the bottom of all he said just now. Butfrom what one can see, it will be difficult, in the future, to obviatethe occurrence of some unpleasant mishap. It's sufficient to fill onewith fear and trembling!"
At this point in her cogitations, she involuntarily melted into tears,so agitated was she; while she secretly exercised her mind how best toact so as to prevent this dreadful calamity.
But while she was lost in this maze of surmises and doubts, Pao-ch'aiunexpectedly appeared from the off side. "What!" she smilinglyexclaimed, "are you dreaming away in a hot broiling sun like this?"
Hsi Jen, at this question, hastily returned her smiles. "Those twobirds," she answered, "were having a fight, and such fun was it that Istopped to watch them."
"Where is cousin Pao off to now in such a hurry, got up in that fineattire?" asked Pao-ch'ai, "I just caught sight of him, as he went by. Imeant to have called out and stopped him, but as he, of late, talksgreater rubbish than ever, I didn't challenge him, but let him go past."
"Our master," rejoined Hsi Jen, "sent for him to go out."
"Ai-yah!" hastily exclaimed Pao-ch'ai, as soon as this remark reachedher ears. "What does he want him for, on a scalding day like this? Mighthe not have thought of something and got so angry about it as to sendfor him to give him a lecture!"
"If it isn't this," added Hsi Jen laughing, "some visitor must, Ipresume, have come and he wishes him to meet him."
"With weather like this," smiled Pao-ch'ai, "even visitors afford noamusement! Why don't they, while this fiery temperature lasts, stay athome, where it's much cooler, instead of gadding about all over theplace?"
"Could you tell them so?" smiled Hsi Jen.
"What was that girl Hsiang-yuen doing in your quarters?" Pao-ch'ai thenasked.
"She only came to chat with us on irrelevant matters." Hsi Jen repliedsmiling. "But did you see the pair of shoes I was pasting the other day?Well, I meant to ask her to-morrow to finish them for me."
Pao-chai, at these words, turned her head round, first on this side, andthen on the other. Seeing that there was no one coming or going: "How isit," she smiled, "that you, who have so much gumption, don't ever showany respect for people's feelings? I've been of late keeping an eye onMiss Yuen's manner, and, from what I can glean from the various rumoursafloat, she can't be, in the slightest degree, her own mistress at home!In that family of theirs, so little can they stand the burden of anyheavy expenses that they don't employ any needlework-people, andordinary everyday things are mostly attended to by their ladiesthemselves. (If not), why is it that every time she has come to us on avisit, and she and I have had a chat, she at once broached the subjectof their being in great difficulties at home, the moment she perceivedthat there was no one present? Yet, whenever I went on to ask her a fewquestions about their usual way of living, her very eyes grew red, whileshe made some indistinct reply; but as for speaking out, she wouldn't.But when I consider the circumstances in which she is placed, for shehas certainly had the misfortune of being left, from her very infancy,without father and mother, the very sight of her is too much for me, andmy heart begins to bleed within me."
"Quite so! Quite so!" observed Hsi Jen, clapping her hands, afterlistening to her throughout. "It isn't strange then if she let me havethe ten butterfly knots I asked her to tie for me only after ever somany days, and if she said that they were coarsely done, but that Ishould make the best of them and use them elsewhere, and that if Iwanted any nice ones, I should wait until by and bye when she came tostay here, when she would work some neatly for me. What you've told menow reminds me that, as she had found it difficult to find an excusewhen we appealed to her, she must have had to slave away, who knows howmuch, till the third watch in the middle of the night. What a stupidthing I was! Had I known this sooner, I would never have told her a wordabout it."
"Last time;" continued Pao-ch'ai, "she told me that when she was at homeshe had ample to do, that she kept busy as late as the third watch, andthat, if she did the slightest stitch of work for any other people, thevarious ladies, belonging to her family, did not like it."
"But as it happens," explained Hsi Jen, "that mulish-minded andperverse-tempered young master of ours won't allow the least bit ofneedlework, no matter whether small or large, to be made by thosepersons employed to do sewing in the household. And as for me, I have notime to turn my attention to all these things."
"Why mind him?" laughed Pao-ch'ai. "Simply ask some one to do the workand finish."
"How could one bamboozle him?" resumed Hsi Jen. "Why, he'll promptlyfind out everything. Such a thing can't even be suggested. The onlything I can do is to quietly slave away, that's all."
"You shouldn't work so hard," smiled Pao-ch'ai. "What do you say to mydoing a few things for you?"
"Are you in real earnest!" ventured Hsi Jen smiling. "Well, in thatcase, it is indeed a piece of good fortune for me! I'll come over myselfin the evening."
But before she could conclude her reply, she of a sudden noticed an oldmatron come up to her with precipitate step. "Where does the report comefrom," she interposed, "that Miss Chin Ch'uan-erh has gone, for no rhymeor reason, and committed suicide by jumping into the well?"
This bit of news startled Hsi Jen. "Which Chin Ch'uan-erh is it," shespeedily inquired.
"Where are two Chin Ch'uan-erhs to be found!" rejoined the old matron."It's the one in our Mistress,' Madame Wang's, apartments, who was theother day sent away for something or other, I don't know what. On herreturn home, she raised her groans to the skies and shed profuse tears,but none of them worried their minds about her, until, who'd havethought it, they could see nothing of her. A servant, however, went justnow to draw water and he says that 'while he was getting it from thewell in the south-east corner, he caught sight of a dead body, that hehurriedly called men to his help, and that when they fished it out, theyunexpectedly found that it was she, but that though they bustled abouttrying to bring her round, everything proved of no avail'"
"This is odd!" Pao-ch'ai exclaimed.
The moment Hsi Jen heard the tidings, she shook her head and moaned. Atthe remembrance of the friendship, which had ever existed between them,tears suddenly trickled down her cheeks. And as for Pao-ch'ai, shelistened to the account of the accident and then hastened to MadameWang's quarters to try and afford her consolation.
Hsi Jen, during this interval, returned to her room. But we will leaveher without further notice, and explain that when Pao-ch'ai reached theinterior of Madame Wang's home, she found everything plunged in perfectstillness. Madame Wang was seated all alone in the inner chamberindulging her sorrow. But such difficulties did Pao-ch'ai experience toallude to the occurrence, that her only alternative was to take a seatnext to her.
"Where do you come from?" asked Madame Wang.
"I come from inside the garden," answered Pao-ch'ai.
"As you come from the garden," Madame Wang inquired, "did you seeanything of your cousin Pao-yue?"
"I saw him just now," Pao-ch'ai replied, "go out, dressed up in hisfineries. But where he is gone to, I don't know."
"Have you perchance heard of any strange occurrence?" asked Madame Wang,while she nodded her head and sighed. "Why, Chin Ch'uan Erh jumped intothe well and committed suicide."
"How is it that she jumped into the well when there was nothing to makeher do so?" Pao-ch'ai inquired. "This is indeed a remarkable thing!"
"The fact is," proceeded Madame Wang, "that she spoilt something theother day, and in a sudden fit of temper, I gave her a slap and sent heraway, simply meaning to be angry with her for a few days and then bringher in again. But, who could have ever imagined that she had such aresentful temperament as to go and drown herself in a well! And is notthis all my fault?"
"It's because you are such a kind-hearted person, aunt," smiledPao-ch'ai, "that such ideas cross your mind! But she didn't jump intothe well when she was in a tantrum; so what must have made her do so wasthat she had to go and live in the lower quarters. Or, she might havebeen standing in front of the well, and her foot slipped, and she fellinto it. While in the upper rooms, she used to be kept under restraint,so when this time she found herself outside, she must, of course, havefelt the wish to go strolling all over the place in search of fun. Howcould she have ever had such a fiery disposition? But even admittingthat she had such a temper, she was, after all, a stupid girl to do asshe did; and she doesn't deserve any pity."
"In spite of what you say," sighed Madame Wang, shaking her head to andfro, "I really feel unhappy at heart."
"You shouldn't, aunt, distress your mind about it!" Pao-ch'ai smiled."Yet, if you feel very much exercised, just give her a few more taelsthan you would otherwise have done, and let her be buried. You'll thuscarry out to the full the feelings of a mistress towards her servant."
"I just now gave them fifty taels for her," pursued Madame Wang. "I alsomeant to let them have some of your cousin's new clothes to enshroud herin. But, who'd have thought it, none of the girls had, strangecoincidence, any newly-made articles of clothing; and there were onlythat couple of birthday suits of your cousin Lin's. But as your cousinLin has ever been such a sensitive child and has always too suffered andailed, I thought it would be unpropitious for her, if her clothes werealso now handed to people to wrap their dead in, after she had been toldthat they were given her for her birthday. So I ordered a tailor to geta suit for her as soon as possible. Had it been any other servant-girl,I could have given her a few taels and have finished. But ChinCh'uan-erh was, albeit a servant-maid, nearly as dear to me as if shehad been a daughter of mine."
Saying this, tears unwittingly ran down from her eyes.
"Aunt!" vehemently exclaimed Pao-ch'ai. "What earthly use is it ofhurrying a tailor just now to prepare clothes for her? I have a coupleof suits I made the other day and won't it save trouble were I to go andbring them for her? Besides, when she was alive, she used to wear my oldclothes. And what's more our figures are much alike."
"What you say is all very well," rejoined Madame Wang; "but can it bethat it isn't distasteful to you?"
"Compose your mind," urged Pao-ch'ai with a smile. "I have never paidany heed to such things."
As she spoke, she rose to her feet and walked away.
Madame Wang then promptly called two servants. "Go and accompany MissPao!" she said.
In a brief space of time, Pao-ch'ai came back with the clothes, anddiscovered Pao-yue seated next to Madame Wang, all melted in tears.Madame Wang was reasoning with him. At the sight of Pao-ch'ai, she, atonce, desisted. When Pao-ch'ai saw them go on in this way, and came toweigh their conversation and to scan the expression on theircountenances, she immediately got a pretty correct insight into theirfeelings. But presently she handed over the clothes, and Madame Wangsent for Chin Ch'uan-erh's mother, to take them away.
But, reader, you will have to peruse the next chapter for furtherdetails.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
  A brother is prompted by ill-feeling to wag his tongue a bit.  A depraved son receives heavy blows with a rattan cane.
Madame Wang, for we shall now continue our story, sent for ChinCh'uan-erh's mother. On her arrival, she gave her several hair-pins andrings, and then told her that she could invite several Buddhist priestsas well to read the prayers necessary to release the spirit frompurgatory. The mother prostrated herself and expressed her gratitude;after which, she took her leave.
Indeed, Pao-yue, on his return from entertaining Yue-ts'un, heard thetidings that Chin Ch'uan-erh had been instigated by a sense of shame totake her own life and he at once fell a prey to grief. So much so, that,when he came inside, and was again spoken to and admonished by MadameWang, he could not utter a single word in his justification. But as soonas he perceived Pao-ch'ai make her appearance in the room, he seized theopportunity to scamper out in precipitate haste. Whither he wastrudging, he himself had not the least idea. But throwing his handsbehind his back and drooping his head against his chest, he gave way tosighs, while with slow and listless step he turned towards the hall.Scarcely, however, had he rounded the screen-wall, which stood in frontof the door-way, when, by a strange coincidence, he ran straight intothe arms of some one, who was unawares approaching from the oppositedirection, and was just about to go towards the inner portion of thecompound.
"Hallo!" that person was heard to cry out, as he stood still.
Pao-yue sustained a dreadful start. Raising his face to see, hediscovered that it was no other than his father. At once, heunconsciously drew a long breath and adopted the only safe course ofdropping his arms against his body and standing on one side.
"Why are you," exclaimed Chia Cheng, "drooping your head in such amelancholy mood, and indulging in all these moans? When Yue-ts'un camejust now and he asked to see you, you only put in your appearance aftera long while. But though you did come, you were not in the leastdisposed to chat with anything like cheerfulness and animation; youbehaved, as you ever do, like a regular fool. I detected then in yourcountenance a certain expression of some hidden hankering and sadness;and now again here you are groaning and sighing! Does all you have notsuffice to please you? Are you still dissatisfied? You've no reason tobe like this, so why is it that you go on in this way?"
Pao-yue had ever, it is true, shown a glib tongue, but on the presentoccasion he was so deeply affected by Chin Ch'uan-erh's fate, and vexedat not being able to die that very instant and follow in her footstepsthat although he was now fully conscious that his father was speaking tohim he could not, in fact, lend him an ear, but simply stood in a timidand nervous mood. Chia Cheng noticed that he was in a state of tremblingand fear, not as ready with an answer as he usually was, and his sorryplight somewhat incensed him, much though he had not at first borne himany ill-feeling. But just as he was about to chide him, a messengerapproached and announced to him: "Some one has come from the mansion ofthe imperial Prince Chung Shun, and wishes to see you, Sir." At thisannouncement, surmises sprung up in Chia Cheng's mind. "Hitherto," hesecretly mused, "I've never had any dealings with the Chung Shunmansion, and why is it that some one is despatched here to-day?" As hegave way to these reflections. "Be quick," he shouted, "and ask him totake a seat in the pavilion," while he himself precipitately entered theinner room and changed his costume. When he came out to greet thevisitor, he discovered that it was the senior officer of the Chung Shunmansion. After the exchange of the salutations prescribed by the rites,they sat down and tea was presented. But before (Chia Cheng) had hadtime to start a topic of conversation, the senior officer anticipatedhim, and speedily observed: "Your humble servant does not pay this visitto-day to your worthy mansion on his own authority, but entirely incompliance with instructions received, as there is a favour that I haveto beg of you. I make bold to trouble you, esteemed Sir, on behalf ofhis highness, to take any steps you might deem suitable, and if you do,not only will his highness remember your kindness, but even I, yourhumble servant, and my colleagues will feel extremely grateful to you."
Chia Cheng listened to him, but he could not nevertheless get a clue ofwhat he was driving at. Promptly returning his smile, he rose to hisfeet. "You come, Sir," he inquired, "at the instance of his royalhighness, but what, I wonder, are the commands you have to give me? Ihope you will explain them to your humble servant, worthy Sir, in orderto enable him to carry them out effectively."
The senior officer gave a sardonic smile.
"There's nothing to carry out," he said. "All you, venerable Sir, haveto do is to utter one single word and the whole thing will be effected.There is in our mansion a certain Ch'i Kuan, who plays the part of youngladies. He hitherto stayed quietly in the mansion; but for the lastthree or five days or so no one has seen him return home. Search hasbeen instituted in every locality, yet his whereabouts cannot bediscovered. But throughout these various inquiries, eight out of the tentenths of the inhabitants of the city have, with one consent, assertedthat he has of late been on very friendly terms with that honourable sonof yours, who was born with the jade in his mouth. This report was toldyour servant and his colleagues, but as your worthy mansion is unlikesuch residences as we can take upon ourselves to enter and search withimpunity, we felt under the necessity of laying the matter before ourimperial master. 'Had it been any of the other actors,' his highnessalso says, 'I wouldn't have minded if even one hundred of them haddisappeared; but this Ch'i Kuan has always been so ready with patrepartee, so respectful and trustworthy that he has thoroughly won myaged heart, and I could never do without him.' He entreats you,therefore, worthy Sir, to, in your turn, plead with your illustriousscion, and request him to let Ch'i Kuan go back, in order that thefeelings, which prompt the Prince to make such earnest supplications,may, in the first place, be satisfied: and that, in the next, your meanservant and his associates may be spared the fatigue of toiling andsearching."
At the conclusion of this appeal, he promptly made a low bow. As soon asChia Cheng found out the object of his errand, he felt both astonishmentand displeasure. With all promptitude, he issued directions that Pao-yueshould be told to come out of the garden. Pao-yue had no notion whateverwhy he was wanted. So speedily he hurried to appear before his father.
"What a regular scoundrel you are!" Chia Cheng exclaimed. "It is enoughthat you won't read your books at home; but will you also go in for allthese lawless and wrongful acts? That Ch'i Kuan is a person whosepresent honourable duties are to act as an attendant on his highness thePrince of Chung Shun, and how extremely heedless of propriety must yoube to have enticed him, without good cause, to come away, and thus havenow brought calamity upon me?"
These reproaches plunged Pao-yue in a dreadful state of consternation.With alacrity he said by way of reply: "I really don't know anythingabout the matter! To what do, after all, the two words Ch'i Kuan refer,I wonder! Still less, besides, am I aware what entice can imply!"
As he spoke, he started crying.
But before Chia Cheng could open his month to pass any further remarks,"Young gentleman," he heard the senior officer interpose with a sardonicsmile: "you shouldn't conceal anything! if he be either hidden in yourhome, or if you know his whereabouts, divulge the truth at once; so thatless trouble should fall to our lot than otherwise would. And will wenot then bear in mind your virtue, worthy scion!"
"I positively don't know." Pao-yue time after time maintained. "Theremust, I fear, be some false rumour abroad; for I haven't so much as seenanything of him."
The senior officer gave two loud smiles, full of derision. "There'sevidence at hand," he rejoined, "so if you compel me to speak out beforeyour venerable father, won't you, young man, have to suffer theconsequences? But as you assert that you don't know who this person is,how is it that that red sash has come to be attached to your waist?"
When Pao-yue caught this allusion, he suddenly felt quite out of hissenses. He stared and gaped; while within himself, he argued: "How hashe come to hear anything about this! But since he knows all these secretparticulars, I cannot, I expect, put him off in other points; sowouldn't it be better for me to pack him off, in order to obviate hisblubbering anything more?" "Sir," he consequently remarked aloud, "howis it that despite your acquaintance with all these minute details, youhave no inkling of his having purchased a house? Are you ignorant of anessential point like this? I've heard people say that he's, at present,staying in the eastern suburbs at a distance of twenty li from the citywalls; at some place or other called Tzu T'an Pao, and that he hasbought there several acres of land and a few houses. So I presume he'sto be found in that locality; but of course there's no saying."
"According to your version," smiled the senior officer, as soon as heheard his explanation, "he must for a certainty be there. I shalltherefore go and look for him. If he's there, well and good; but if not,I shall come again and request you to give me further directions."
These words were still on his lips, when he took his leave and walkedoff with hurried step.
Chia Cheng was by this time stirred up to such a pitch of indignationthat his eyes stared aghast, and his mouth opened in bewilderment; andas he escorted the officer out, he turned his head and bade Pao-yue notbudge. "I have," (he said), "to ask you something on my return."Straightway he then went to see the officer off. But just as he wasturning back, he casually came across Chia Huan and several servant-boysrunning wildly about in a body. "Quick, bring him here to me!" shoutedChia Cheng to the young boys. "I want to beat him."
Chia Huan, at the sight of his father, was so terrified that his bonesmollified and his tendons grew weak, and, promptly lowering his head, hestood still."
"What are you running about for?" Chia Cheng asked. "These menials ofyours do not mind you, but go who knows where, and let you roam aboutlike a wild horse! Where are the attendants who wait on you at school?"he cried.
When Chia Huan saw his father in such a dreadful rage, he availedhimself of the first opportunity to try and clear himself. "I wasn'trunning about just now" he said. "But as I was passing by the side ofthat well, I caught sight, for in that well a servant-girl was drowned,of a human head that large, a body that swollen, floating about inreally a frightful way and I therefore hastily rushed past."
Chia Cheng was thunderstruck by this disclosure. "There's been nothingup, so who has gone and jumped into the well?" he inquired. "Never hasthere been anything of the kind in my house before! Ever since the timeof our ancestors, servants have invariably been treated with clemencyand consideration. But I expect that I must of late have become remissin my domestic affairs, and that the managers must have arrogated tothemselves the right of domineering and so been the cause of bringingabout such calamities as violent deaths and disregard of life. Werethese things to reach the ears of people outside, what will become ofthe reputation of our seniors? Call Chia Lien and Lai Ta here!" heshouted.
The servant-lads signified their obedience, with one voice. They wereabout to go and summon them, when Chia Huan hastened to press forward.Grasping the lapel of Chia Cheng's coat, and clinging to his knees, heknelt down. "Father, why need you be angry?" he said. "Excluding thepeople in Madame Wang's rooms, this occurrence is entirely unknown toany of the rest; and I have heard my mother mention...." At this point,he turned his head, and cast a glance in all four quarters.
Chia Cheng guessed his meaning, and made a sign with his eyes. The youngboys grasped his purpose and drew far back on either side.
Chia Huan resumed his confidences in a low tone of voice. "My mother,"he resumed, "told me that when brother Pao-yue was, the other day, inMadame Wang's apartments, he seized her servant-maid Chin Ch'uan-erhwith the intent of dishonouring her. That as he failed to carry out hisdesign, he gave her a thrashing, which so exasperated Chin Ch'uan-erhthat she threw herself into the well and committed suicide...."
Before however he could conclude his account, Chia Cheng had beenincensed to such a degree that his face assumed the colour of silverpaper. "Bring Pao-yue here," he cried. While uttering these orders, hewalked into the study. "If any one does again to-day come to dissuademe," he vociferated, "I shall take this official hat, and sash, my homeand private property and surrender everything at once to him to go andbestow them upon Pao-yue; for if I cannot escape blame (with a son likethe one I have), I mean to shave this scanty trouble-laden hair about mytemples and go in search of some unsullied place where I can spend therest of my days alone! I shall thus also avoid the crime of heaping,above, insult upon my predecessors, and, below, of having given birth tosuch a rebellious son."
At the sight of Chia Cheng in this exasperation, the family companionsand attendants speedily realised that Pao-yue must once more be the causeof it, and the whole posse hastened to withdraw from the study, bitingtheir fingers and putting their tongues out.
Chia Cheng panted with excitement. He stretched his chest out and satbolt upright on a chair. His whole face was covered with the traces oftears. "Bring Pao-yue! Bring Pao-yue!" he shouted consecutively. "Fetch abig stick; bring a rope and tie him up; close all the doors! If any onedoes communicate anything about it in the inner rooms, why, I'llimmediately beat him to death."
The servant-boys felt compelled to express their obedience with oneconsent, and some of them came to look after Pao-yue.
As for Pao-yue, when he heard Chia Cheng enjoin him not to move, heforthwith became aware that the chances of an unpropitious issueoutnumbered those of a propitious one, but how could he have had anyidea that Chia Huan as well had put in his word? There he still stood inthe pavilion, revolving in his mind how he could get some one to speedinside and deliver a message for him. But, as it happened, not a soulappeared. He was quite at a loss to know where even Pei Ming could be.His longing was at its height, when he perceived an old nurse come onthe scene. The sight of her exulted Pao-yue, just as much as if he hadobtained pearls or gems; and hurriedly approaching her, he dragged herand forced her to halt. "Go in," he urged, "at once and tell them thatmy father wishes to beat me to death. Be quick, be quick, for it'surgent, there's no time to be lost."
But, first and foremost, Pao-yue's excitement was so intense that hespoke with indistinctness. In the second place, the old nurse was, asluck would have it, dull of hearing, so that she did not catch the driftof what he said, and she misconstrued the two words: "it's urgent," forthe two representing jumped into the well. Readily smiling therefore:"If she wants to jump into the well, let her do so," she said. "What'sthere to make you fear, Master Secundus?"
"Go out," pursued Pao-yue, in despair, on discovering that she was deaf,"and tell my page to come."
"What's there left unsettled?" rejoined the old nurse. "Everything hasbeen finished long ago! A tip has also been given them; so how is itthings are not settled?"
Pao-yue fidgetted with his hands and feet. He was just at his wits' ends,when he espied Chia Cheng's servant-boys come up and press him to goout.
As soon as Chia Cheng caught sight of him, his eyes got quite red.Without even allowing himself any time to question him about his gaddingabout with actors, and the presents he gave them on the sly, during hisabsence from home; or about his playing the truant from school andlewdly importuning his mother's maid, during his stay at home, he simplyshouted: "Gag his mouth and positively beat him till he dies!"
The servant-boys did not have the boldness to disobey him. They wereunder the necessity of seizing Pao-yue, of stretching him on a bench, andof taking a heavy rattan and giving him about ten blows.
Pao-yue knew well enough that he could not plead for mercy, and all hecould do was to whimper and cry.
Chia Cheng however found fault with the light blows they administered tohim. With one kick he shoved the castigator aside, and snatching therattan into his own hands, he spitefully let (Pao-yue) have ten blows andmore.
Pao-yue had not, from his very birth, experienced such anguish. From theoutset, he found the pain unbearable; yet he could shout and weep asboisterously as ever he pleased; but so weak subsequently did hisbreath, little by little, become, so hoarse his voice, and so choked histhroat that he could not bring out any sound.
The family companions noticed that he was beaten in a way that mightlead to an unpropitious end, and they drew near with all despatch andmade earnest entreaties and exhortations. But would Chia Cheng listen tothem?
"You people," he answered, "had better ask him whether the tricks he hasbeen up to deserve to be overlooked or not! It's you who have all alongso thoroughly spoilt him as to make him reach this degree of depravity!And do you yet come to advise me to spare him? When by and bye you'veincited him to commit parricide or regicide, you will at length, then,give up trying to dissuade me, eh?"
This language jarred on the ears of the whole party; and knowing onlytoo well that he was in an exasperated mood, they fussed aboutendeavouring to find some one to go in and convey the news.
But Madame Wang did not presume to be the first to inform dowager ladyChia about it. Seeing no other course open to her, she hastily dressedherself and issued out of the garden. Without so much as worrying hermind as to whether there were any male inmates about or not, shestraightway leant on a waiting-maid and hurriedly betook herself intothe library, to the intense consternation of the companions, pages andall the men present, who could not manage to clear out of the way intime.
Chia Cheng was on the point of further belabouring his son, when at thesight of Madame Wang walking in, his temper flared up with suchincreased violence, just as fire on which oil is poured, that the rodfell with greater spite and celerity. The two servant-boys, who heldPao-yue down, precipitately loosened their grip and beat a retreat.Pao-yue had long ago lost all power of movement. Chia Cheng, however, wasagain preparing to assail him, when the rattan was immediately lockedtightly by Madame Wang, in both her arms.
"Of course, of course," Chia Cheng exclaimed, "what you want to doto-day is to make me succumb to anger!"
"Pao-yue does, I admit, merit to be beaten," sobbed Madame Wang; "but youshould also, my lord, take good care of yourself! The weather, besides,is extremely hot, and our old lady is not feeling quite up to the mark.Were you to knock Pao-yue about and kill him, it would not matter much;but were perchance our venerable senior to suddenly fall ill, wouldn'tit be a grave thing?"
"Better not talk about such things!" observed Chia Cheng with a listlesssmile. "By my bringing up such a degenerate child of retribution I havemyself become unfilial! Whenever I've had to call him to account, therehas always been a whole crowd of you to screen him; so isn't it as wellfor me to avail myself of to-day to put an end to his cur-like existenceand thus prevent future misfortune?"
As he spoke, he asked for a rope to strangle him; but Madame Wang lostno time in clasping him in her embrace, and reasoning with him as shewept. "My lord and master," she said, "it is your duty, of course, tokeep your son in proper order, but you should also regard therelationship of husband and wife. I'm already a woman of fifty and I'veonly got this scapegrace. Was there any need for you to give him such abitter lesson? I wouldn't presume to use any strong dissuasion; buthaving, on this occasion, gone so far as to harbour the design ofkilling him, isn't this a fixed purpose on your part to cut short my ownexistence? But as you are bent upon strangling him, be quick and firststrangle me before you strangle him! It will be as well that we, motherand son, should die together, so that if even we go to hell, we may beable to rely upon each other!"
At the conclusion of these words, she enfolded Pao-yue in her embrace andraised her voice in loud sobs.
After listening to her appeal, Chia Cheng could not restrain a deepsigh; and taking a seat on one of the chairs, the tears ran down hischeeks like drops of rain.
But while Madame Wang held Pao-yue in her arms, she noticed that his facewas sallow and his breath faint, and that his green gauze nethergarments were all speckled with stains of blood, so she could not checkher fingers from unloosening his girdle. And realising that from thethighs to the buttocks, his person was here green, there purple, herewhole, there broken, and that there was, in fact, not the least bit,which had not sustained some injury, she of a sudden burst out in bitterlamentations for her offspring's wretched lot in life. But whilebemoaning her unfortunate son, she again recalled to mind the memory ofChia Chu, and vehemently calling out "Chia Chu," she sobbed: "if but youwere alive, I would not care if even one hundred died!"
But by this time, the inmates of the inner rooms discovered that MadameWang had gone out, and Li Kung-ts'ai, Wang Hsi-feng and Ting Ch'un andher sisters promptly rushed out of the garden and came to join her.
While Madame Wang mentioned, with eyes bathed in tears, the name of ChiaChu, every one listened with composure, with the exception of LiKung-ts'ai, who unable to curb her feelings also raised her voice insobs. As soon as Chia Cheng heard her plaints, his tears trickled downwith greater profusion, like pearls scattered about. But just as thereseemed no prospect of their being consoled, a servant-girl was unawaresheard to announce: "Our dowager lady has come!" Before this announcementwas ended, her tremulous accents reached their ears from outside thewindow. "If you were to beat me to death and then despatch him," shecried, "won't you be clear of us!"
Chia Cheng, upon seeing that his mother was coming, felt distressed andpained. With all promptitude, he went out to meet her. He perceived hisold parent, toddling along, leaning on the arm of a servant-girl,wagging her head and gasping for breath.
Chia Cheng drew forward and made a curtsey. "On a hot broiling day likethis," he ventured, forcing a smile, "what made you, mother, get soangry as to rush over in person? Had you anything to enjoin me, youcould have sent for me, your son, and given me your orders."
Old lady Chia, at these words, halted and panted. "Are you reallychiding me?" she at the same time said in a stern tone. "It's I whoshould call you to task! But as the son, I've brought up, isn't worth astraw, to whom can I go and address a word?"
When Chia Cheng heard language so unlike that generally used by her, heimmediately fell on his knees. While doing all in his power to containhis tears: "The reason why," he explained, "your son corrects hisoffspring is a desire to reflect lustre on his ancestors and splendouron his seniors; so how can I, your son, deserve the rebuke with whichyou greet me, mother?"
At this reply, old lady Chia spurted contemptuously. "I made just oneremark," she added, "and you couldn't stand it, and can Pao-yue likelyput up with that death-working cane? You say that your object incorrecting your son is to reflect lustre on your ancestors and splendouron your seniors, but in what manner did your father correct you in daysgone by?"
Saying this, tears suddenly rolled down from her eyes also.
Chia Cheng forced another smile. "Mother;" he proceeded, "you shouldn'tdistress yourself! Your son did it in a sudden fit of rage, but fromthis time forth I won't touch him again."
Dowager lady Chia smiled several loud sneering smiles. "But youshouldn't get into a huff with me!" she urged. "He's your son, so if youchoose to flog him, you can naturally do so, but I cannot help thinkingthat you're sick and tired of me, your mother, of your wife and of yourson, so wouldn't it be as well that we should get out of your way, thesooner the better, as we shall then be able to enjoy peace and quiet?"
So speaking, "Go and look after the chairs." she speedily cried to aservant. "I and your lady as well as Pao-yue will, without delay, returnto Nanking."
The servant had no help but to assent.
Old lady Chia thereupon called Madame Wang over to her. "You needn'tindulge in sorrow!" she exhorted her. "Pao-yue is now young, and youcherish him fondly; but does it follow that when in years to come hebecomes an official, he'll remember that you are his mother? You mustn'ttherefore at present lavish too much of your affection upon him, so thatyou may by and bye, spare yourself, at least, some displeasure."
When these exhortations fell on Chia Cheng's ear, he instantlyprostrated himself before her. "Your remarks mother," he observed, "cutthe ground under your son's very feet."
"You distinctly act in a way," cynically smiled old lady Chia,"sufficient to deprive me of any ground to stand upon, and then you, onthe contrary, go and speak about yourself! But when we shall have goneback, your mind will be free of all trouble. We'll see then who'llinterfere and dissuade you from beating people!"
After this reply, she went on to give orders to directly get ready thebaggage, carriages, chairs and horses necessary for their return.
Chia Cheng stiffly and rigidly fell on his knees, and knocked his headbefore her, and pleaded guilty. Dowager lady Chia then addressed himsome words, and as she did so, she came to have a look at Pao-yue. Uponperceiving that the thrashing he had got this time was unlike those ofpast occasions, she experienced both pain and resentment. So claspinghim in her arms, she wept and wept incessantly. It was only after MadameWang, lady Feng and the other ladies had reasoned with her for a timethat they at length gradually succeeded in consoling her.
But waiting-maids, married women, and other attendants soon came tosupport Pao-yue and take him away. Lady Feng however at once expostulatedwith them. "You stupid things," she exclaimed, won't you open your eyesand see! How ever could he be raised and made to walk in the state he'sin! Don't you yet instantly run inside and fetch some rattan slings anda bench to carry him out of this on?
At this suggestion, the servants rushed hurry-scurry inside and actuallybrought a bench; and, lifting Pao-yue, they placed him on it. Thenfollowing dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the other inmates into theinner part of the building, they carried him into his grandmother'sapartments. But Chia Cheng did not fail to notice that his old mother'spassion had not by this time yet abated, so without presuming to consulthis own convenience, he too came inside after them. Here he discoveredhow heavily he had in reality castigated Pao-yue. Upon perceiving MadameWang also crying, with one breath, "My flesh;" and, with another, sayingwith tears: "My son, if you had died sooner, instead of Chu Erh, andleft Chu Erh behind you, you would have saved your father these fits ofanger, and even I would not have had to fruitlessly worry and fret forhalf of my existence! Were anything to happen now to make you forsakeme, upon whom will you have me depend?" And then after heapingreproaches upon herself for a time, break out afresh in lamentations forher, unavailing offspring, Chia Cheng was much cut up and felt consciousthat he should not with his own hand have struck his son so ruthlesslyas to bring him to this state, and he first and foremost directed hisattention to consoling dowager lady Chia.
"If your son isn't good," rejoined the old lady, repressing her tears,"it is naturally for you to exercise control over him. But you shouldn'tbeat him to such a pitch! Don't you yet bundle yourself away? What areyou dallying in here for? Is it likely, pray, that your heart is not yetsatisfied, and that you wish to feast your eyes by seeing him die beforeyou go?"
These taunts induced Chia Cheng to eventually withdraw out of the room.By this time, Mrs. Hsueeh together with Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang Ling, Hsi Jen,Shih Hsiang-yuen and his other cousins had also congregated in theapartments. Hsi Jen's heart was overflowing with grief; but she couldnot very well give expression to it. When she saw that a whole companyof people shut him in, some pouring water over him, others fanning him;and that she herself could not lend a hand in any way, she availedherself of a favourable moment to make her exit. Proceeding then as faras the second gate, she bade the servant-boys go and fetch Pei-Ming. Onhis arrival, she submitted him to a searching inquiry. "Why is it," sheasked, "that he was beaten just now without the least provocation; andthat you didn't run over soon to tell me a word about it?"
"It happened," answered Pei Ming in great perplexity, "that I wasn'tpresent. It was only after he had given him half the flogging that Iheard what was going on, and lost no time in ascertaining what it wasall about. It's on account of those affairs connected with Ch'i Kuan andthat girl Chin Ch'uan."
"How did these things come to master's knowledge?" inquired Hsi Jen.
"As for that affair with Ch'i Kuan," continued Pei Ming, "it is verylikely Mr. Hsueeh P'an who has let it out; for as he has ever beenjealous, he may, in the absence of any other way of quenching hisresentment, have instigated some one or other outside, who knows, tocome and see master and add fuel to his anger. As for Chin Ch'uan-erh'saffair it has presumably been told him by Master Tertius. This I heardfrom the lips of some person, who was in attendance upon master."
Hsi Jen saw how much his two versions tallied with the truecircumstances, so she readily credited the greater portion of what wastold her. Subsequently, she returned inside. Here she found a wholecrowd of people trying to do the best to benefit Pao-yue. But after theyhad completed every arrangement, dowager lady Chia impressed on theirminds that it would be better were they to carefully move him into hisown quarters. With one voice they all signified their approval, and witha good deal of bustling and fussing, they speedily transferred Pao-yueinto the I Hung court, where they stretched him out comfortably on hisown bed. Then after some further excitement, the members of the familybegan gradually to disperse. Hsi Jen at last entered his room, andwaited upon him with singleness of heart.
But, reader, if you feel any curiosity to hear what follows, listen towhat you will find divulged in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
  Tai-yue loves Pao-yue with extreme affection; but, on account of this      affection, her female cousin gets indignant.  Hsueeh P'an commits a grave mistake; but Pao-ch'ai makes this mistake a      pretext to tender advice to her brother.
When Hsi Jen saw dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the other members ofthe family take their leave, our narrative says, she entered the room.and, taking a seat next to Pao-yue, she asked him, while she did all shecould to hide her tears: "How was it that he beat you to such extremes?"
Pao-yue heaved a sigh. "It was simply," he replied, "about those trifles.But what's the use of your asking me about them? The lower part of mybody is so very sore! Do look and see where I'm bruised!"
At these words, Hsi Jen put out her hand, and inserting it gently underhis clothes, she began to pull down the middle garments. She had butslightly moved them, however, when Pao-yue ground his teeth and groaned"ai-ya." Hsi Jen at once stayed her hand. It was after three or foursimilar attempts that she, at length, succeeded in drawing them down.Then looking closely, Hsi Jen discovered that the upper part of his legswas all green and purple, one mass of scars four fingers wide, andcovered with huge blisters.
Hsi Jen gnashed her teeth. "My mother!" she ejaculated, "how is it thathe struck you with such a ruthless hand! Had you minded the least bit ofmy advice to you, things wouldn't have come to such a pass! Luckily, noharm was done to any tendon or bone; for had you been crippled by thethrashing you got, what could we do?"
In the middle of these remarks, she saw the servant-girls come, and theytold her that Miss Pao-ch'ai had arrived. Hearing this, Hsi Jen saw wellenough that she had no time to put him on his middle garments, soforthwith snatching a double gauze coverlet, she threw it over Pao-yue.This done, she perceived Pao-ch'ai walk in, her hands laden with pillsand medicines.
"At night," she said to Hsi Jen, "take these medicines and dissolve themin wine and then apply them on him, and, when the fiery virus from thatstagnant blood has been dispelled, he'll be all right again."
After these directions, she handed the medicines to Hsi Jen. "Is hefeeling any better now?" she proceeded to inquired.
"Thanks!" rejoined Pao-yue. "I'm feeling better," he at the same timewent on to say; after which, he pressed her to take a seat.
Pao-ch'ai noticed that he could open his eyes wide, that he could speakand that he was not as bad as he had been, and she felt considerableinward relief. But nodding her head, she sighed. "If you had long agolistened to the least bit of the advice tendered to you by people thingswould not have reached this climax to-day," she said. "Not to speak ofthe pain experienced by our dear ancestor and aunt Wang, the sight ofyou in this state makes even us feel at heart...."
Just as she had uttered half of the remark she meant to pass, shequickly suppressed the rest; and smitten by remorse for having spokentoo hastily, she could not help getting red in the face and lowering herhead.
Pao-yue was realising how affectionate, how friendly and how replete withdeep meaning were the sentiments that dropped from her month, when, of asudden, he saw her seal her lips and, flashing crimson, droop her head,and simply fumble with her girdle. Yet so fascinating was she in thosetimid blushes, which completely baffle description, that his feelingswere roused within him to such a degree, that all sense of pain flew atonce beyond the empyrean. "I've only had to bear a few blows," hereflected, "and yet every one of them puts on those pitiful lookssufficient to evoke love and regard; so were, after all, any mishap oruntimely end to unexpectedly befall me, who can tell how much moreafflicted they won't be! And as they go on in this way, I shall havethem, were I even to die in a moment, to feel so much for me; so therewill indeed be no reason for regret, albeit the concerns of a wholelifetime will be thus flung entirely to the winds!"
While indulging in these meditations, ha overheard Pao-ch'ai ask HsiJen: "How is it that he got angry, without rhyme or reason, and startedbeating him?" and Hsi Jen tell her, in reply, the version given to herby Pei Ming.
Pao-yue had, in fact, no idea as yet of what had been said by Chia Huan,and, when he heard Hsi Jen's disclosures, he eventually got to know whatit was; but as it also criminated Hsueeh P'an, he feared lest Pao-ch'aimight feel unhappy, so he lost no time in interrupting Hsi Jen.
"Cousin Hsueeh," he interposed, "has never been like that; you peoplemustn't therefore give way to idle surmises!"
These words were enough to make Pao-ch'ai see that Pao-yue had thought itexpedient to say something to stop Hsi Jen's mouth, apprehending thather suspicions might get roused; and she consequently secretly musedwithin herself: "He has been beaten to such a pitch, and yet, heedlessof his own pains and aches, he's still so careful not to hurt people'sfeelings. But since you can be so considerate, why don't you take alittle more care in greater concerns outside, so that your father shouldfeel a little happier, and that you also should not have to suffer suchbitter ordeals! But notwithstanding that the dread of my feeling hurthas prompted you to interrupt Hsi Jen in what she had to tell me, is itlikely that I am blind to the fact that my brother has ever followed hisfancies, allowed his passions to run riot, and never done a thing toexercise any check over himself? His temperament is such that he sometime back created, all on account of that fellow Ch'in Chung, a rumpusthat turned heaven and earth topsy-turvy; and, as a matter of course,he's now far worse than he was ever before!"
"You people," she then observed aloud, at the close of thesecogitations, "shouldn't bear this one or that one a grudge. I can't helpthinking that it's, after all, because of your usual readiness, cousinPao-yue, to hobnob with that set that your father recently lost controlover his temper. But assuming that my brother did speak in a carelessmanner and did casually allude to you cousin Pao-yue, it was with nodesign to instigate any one! In the first place, the remarks he madewere really founded on actual facts; and secondly, he's not one to evertrouble himself about such petty trifles as trying to guard againstanimosities. Ever since your youth up, Miss Hsi, you've simply hadbefore your eyes a person so punctilious as cousin Pao-yue, but have youever had any experience of one like that brother of mine, who neitherfears the powers in heaven or in earth, and who readily blurts out allhe thinks?"
Hsi Jen, seeing Pao-yue interrupt her, at the bare mention of Hsueeh P'an,understood at once that she must have spoken recklessly and gave way tomisgivings lest Pao-ch'ai might not have been placed in a falseposition, but when she heard the language used by Pao-ch'ai, she wasfilled with a keener sense of shame and could not utter a word. Pao-yuetoo, after listening to the sentiments, which Pao-ch'ai expressed, felt,partly because they were so magnanimous and noble, and partly becausethey banished all misconception from his mind, his heart and soul throbwith greater emotion then ever before. When, however, about to put inhis word, he noticed Pao-ch'ai rise to her feet.
"I'll come again to see you to-morrow," she said, "but take good care ofyourself! I gave the medicines I brought just now to Hsi Jen; let herrub you with them at night and I feel sure you'll get all right."
With these recommendations, she walked out of the door.
Hsi Jen hastened to catch her up and escorted her beyond the court."Miss," she remarked, "we've really put you to the trouble of coming.Some other day, when Mr. Secundus is well, I shall come in person tothank you."
"What's there to thank me for?" replied Pao-ch'ai, turning her headround and smiling. "But mind, you advise him to carefully tend hishealth, and not to give way to idle thoughts and reckless ideas, andhe'll recover. If there's anything he fancies to eat or to amuse himselfwith, come quietly over to me and fetch it for him. There will be no useto disturb either our old lady, or Madame Wang, or any of the others;for in the event of its reaching Mr. Chia Cheng's ear, nothing may, atthe time, come of it; but if by and bye he finds it to be true, we'll,doubtless, suffer for it!"
While tendering this advice, she went on her way.
Hsi Jen retraced her steps and returned into the room, fostering genuinefeelings of gratitude for Pao-ch'ai. But on entering, she espied Pao-yuesilently lost in deep thought, and looking as if he were asleep, and yetnot quite asleep, so she withdrew into the outer quarters to comb herhair and wash.
Pao-yue meanwhile lay motionless in bed. His buttocks tingled with pain,as if they were pricked with needles, or dug with knives; giving him toboot a fiery sensation just as if fire were eating into them. He triedto change his position a bit, but unable to bear the anguish, he burstinto groans. The shades of evening were by this time falling. Perceivingthat though Hsi Jen had left his side there remained still two or threewaiting-maids in attendance, he said to them, as he could find nothingfor them to do just then, "You might as well go and comb your hair andperform your ablutions; come in, when I call you."
Hearing this, they likewise retired. During this while, Pao-yue fell intoa drowsy state. Chiang Yue-han then rose before his vision and told himall about his capture by men from the Chung Shun mansion. Presently,Chin Ch'uan-erh too appeared in his room bathed in tears, and explainedto him the circumstances which drove her to leap into the well. ButPao-yue, who was half dreaming and half awake, was not able to give hismind to anything that was told him. Unawares, he became conscious ofsome one having given him a push; and faintly fell on his ear theplaintive tones of some person in distress. Pao-yue was startled out ofhis dreams. On opening his eyes, he found it to be no other than LinTai-yue. But still fearing that it was only a dream, he promptly raisedhimself, and drawing near her face he passed her features under a minutescrutiny. Seeing her two eyes so swollen, as to look as big as peaches,and her face glistening all over with tears: "If it is not Tai-yue," (hethought), "who else can it be?"
Pao-yue meant to continue his scrutiny, but the lower part of his persongave him such unbearable sharp twitches that finding it a hard task tokeep up, he, with a shout of "Ai-yo," lay himself down again, as heheaved a sigh. "What do you once more come here for?" he asked. "Thesun, it is true, has set; but the heat remaining on the ground hasn'tyet gone, so you may, by coming over, get another sunstroke. Of course,I've had a thrashing but I don't feel any pains or aches. If I behave inthis fashion, it's all put on to work upon their credulity, so that theymay go and spread the reports outside in such a way as to reach myfather's ear. Really it's all sham; so you mustn't treat it as a fact!"
Though Lin Tai-yue was not giving way at the time to any wails or loudsobs, yet the more she indulged in those suppressed plaints of hers, theworse she felt her breath get choked and her throat obstructed; so thatwhen Pao-yue's assurances fell on her ear, she could not express a singlesentiment, though she treasured thousands in her mind. It was only aftera long pause that she at last could observe, with agitated voice: "Youmust after this turn over a new leaf."
At these words, Pao-yue heaved a deep sigh. "Compose your mind," heurged. "Don't speak to me like this; for I am quite prepared to even laydown my life for all those persons!"
But scarcely had he concluded this remark than some one outside thecourt was heard to say: "Our lady Secunda has arrived."
Lin Tai-yue readily concluded that it was lady Feng coming, so springingto her feet at once, "I'm off," she said; "out by the back-court. I'lllook you up again by and bye."
"This is indeed strange!" exclaimed Pao-yue as he laid hold of her andtried to detain her. "How is it that you've deliberately started livingin fear and trembling of her!"
Lin Tai-yue grew impatient and stamped her feet. "Look at my eyes!" sheadded in an undertone. "Must those people amuse themselves again bypoking fun at me?"
After this response, Pao-yue speedily let her go.
Lin Tai-yue with hurried step withdrew behind the bed; and no sooner hadshe issued into the back-court, than lady Feng made her appearance inthe room by the front entrance.
"Are you better?" she asked Pao-yue. "If you fancy anything to eat, mindyou send some one over to my place to fetch it for you."
Thereupon Mrs. Hsueeh also came to pay him a visit. Shortly after, amessenger likewise arrived from old lady Chia (to inquire after him).
When the time came to prepare the lights, Pao-yue had a couple ofmouthfuls of soup to eat, but he felt so drowsy and heavy that he fellasleep.
Presently, Chou Jui's wife, Wu Hsin-teng's wife and Cheng Hao-shih'swife, all of whom were old dames who frequently went to and fro, heardthat Pao-yue had been flogged and they too hurried into his quarters.
Hsi Jen promptly went out to greet them. "Aunts," she whispered,smiling, "you've come a little too late; Master Secundus is sleeping."Saying this, she led them into the room on the opposite side, and,pressing then to sit down, she poured them some tea.
After sitting perfectly still for a time, "When Master Secundus awakes"the dames observed, "do send us word!"
Hsi Jen assured them that she would, and escorted them out. Just,however, as she was about to retrace her footsteps, she met an oldmatron, sent over by Madame Wang, who said to her: "Our mistress wantsone of Master Secundus attendants to go and see her."
Upon hearing this message, Hsi Jen communed with her own thoughts. Thenturning round, she whispered to Ch'ing Wen, She Yueeh, Ch'iu Wen, and theother maids: "Our lady wishes to see one of us, so be careful and remainin the room while I go. I'll be back soon."
At the close of her injunctions, she and the matron made their exit outof the garden by a short cut, and repaired into the drawing-room.
Madame Wang was seated on the cool couch, waving a banana-leaf fan. Whenshe became conscious of her arrival: "It didn't matter whom you sent,"she remarked, "any one would have done. But have you left him again?Who's there to wait on him?"
At this question, Hsi Jen lost no time in forcing a smile. "MasterSecundus," she replied, "just now fell into a sound sleep. Those four orfive girls are all right now, they are well able to attend to theirmaster, so please, Madame, dispel all anxious thoughts! I was afraidthat your ladyship might have some orders to give, and that if I sentany of them, they might probably not hear distinctly, and thus occasiondelay in what there was to be done."
"There's nothing much to tell you," added Madame Wang. "I only wish toask how his pains and aches are getting on now?"
"I applied on Mr. Secundus," answered Hsi Jen, "the medicine, which MissPao-ch'ai brought over; and he's better than he was. He was so sore atone time that he couldn't lie comfortably; but the deep sleep, in whichhe is plunged now, is a clear sign of his having improved."
"Has he had anything to eat?" further inquired Madame Wang.
"Our dowager mistress sent him a bowl of soup," Hsi Jen continued, "andof this he has had a few mouthfuls. He shouted and shouted that hismouth was parched and fancied a decoction of sour plums, but rememberingthat sour plums are astringent things, that he had been thrashed only ashort time before, and that not having been allowed to groan, he must,of course, have been so hard pressed that fiery virus and heated bloodmust unavoidably have accumulated in the heart, and that were he to putanything of the kind within his lips, it might be driven into thecardiac regions and give rise to some serious illness; and what thenwould we do? I therefore reasoned with him for ever so long and at lastsucceeded in deterring him from touching any. So simply taking thatsyrup of roses, prepared with sugar, I mixed some with water and he hadhalf a small cup of it. But he drank it with distaste; for, beingsurfeited with it, he found it neither scented nor sweet."
"Ai-yah!" ejaculated Madame Wang. "Why didn't you come earlier and tellme? Some one sent me the other day several bottles of scented water. Imeant at one time to have given him some, but as I feared that it wouldbe mere waste, I didn't let him have any. But since he is so sick andtired of that preparation of roses, that he turns up his nose at it,take those two bottles with you. If you just mix a teaspoonful of it ina cup of water, it will impart to it a very strong perfume."
So saying, she hastened to tell Ts'ai Yuen to fetch the bottles ofscented water, which she had received as a present a few days before.
"Let her only bring a couple of them, they'll be enough!" Hsi Jen chimedin. "If you give us more, it will be a useless waste! If it isn'tenough, I can come and fetch a fresh supply. It will come to the samething!"
Having listened to all they had to say, Ts'ai Yuen left the room. Aftersome considerable time, she, in point of fact, returned with only acouple of bottles, which she delivered to Hsi Jen.
On examination, Hsi Jen saw two small glass bottles, no more than threeinches in size, with screwing silver stoppers at the top. On thegosling-yellow labels was written, on one: "Pure extract of _oleafragrans_," on the other, "Pure extract of roses."
"What fine things these are!" Hsi Jen smiled. "How many small bottlesthe like of this can there be?"
"They are of the kind sent to the palace," rejoined Madame Wang. "Didn'tyou notice that gosling-yellow slip? But mind, take good care of themfor him; don't fritter them away!"
Hsi Jen assented. She was about to depart when Madame Wang called herback. "I've thought of something," she said, "that I want to ask you."
Hsi Jen hastily came back.
Madame Wang made sure that there was no one in the room. "I've heard afaint rumour," she then inquired, "to the effect that Pao-yue got athrashing on this occasion on account of something or other whichHuan-Erh told my husband. Have you perchance heard what it was that hesaid? If you happen to learn anything about it, do confide in me, and Iwon't make any fuss and let people know that it was you who told me."
"I haven't heard anything of the kind," answered Hsi Jen. "It wasbecause Mr. Secundus forcibly detained an actor, and that people cameand asked master to restore him to them that he got flogged."
"It was also for this," continued Madame Wang as she nodded her head,"but there's another reason besides."
"As for the other reason, I honestly haven't the least idea about it,"explained Hsi Jen. "But I'll make bold to-day, and say something in yourpresence, Madame, about which I don't know whether I am right or wrongin speaking. According to what's proper...."
She had only spoken half a sentence, when hastily she closed her mouthagain.
"You are at liberty to proceed," urged Madame Wang.
"If your ladyship will not get angry, I'll speak out," remarked Hsi Jen.
"Why should I get angry?" observed Madame Wang. "Proceed!"
"According to what's proper," resumed Hsi Jen, "our Mr. Secundus shouldreceive our master's admonition, for if master doesn't hold him incheck, there's no saying what he mightn't do in the future."
As soon as Madame Wang heard this, she clasped her hands and uttered theinvocation, "O-mi-to-fu!" Unable to resist the impulse, she drew nearHsi Jen. "My dear child," she added, "you have also luckily understoodthe real state of things. What you told me is in perfect harmony with myown views! Is it likely that I don't know how to look after a son? Informer days, when your elder master, Chu, was alive, how did I succeedin keeping him in order? And can it be that I don't, after all, nowunderstand how to manage a son? But there's a why and a wherefore in it.The thought is ever present in my mind now, that I'm already a womanpast fifty, that of my children there only remains this single one, thathe too is developing a delicate physique, and that, what's more, ourdear senior prizes him as much as she would a jewel, that were he keptunder strict control, and anything perchance to happen to him, shemight, an old lady as she is, sustain some harm from resentment, andthat as the high as well as the low will then have no peace or quiet,won't things get in a bad way? So I feel prompted to spoil him byover-indulgence. Time and again I reason with him. Sometimes, I talk tohim; sometimes, I advise him; sometimes, I cry with him. But though, forthe time being, he's all right, he doesn't, later on, worry his mind inany way about what I say, until he positively gets into some other mess,when he settles down again. But should any harm befall him, throughthese floggings, upon whom will I depend by and bye?"
As she spoke, she could not help melting into tears.
At the sight of Madame Wang in this disconsolate mood, Hsi Jen herselfunconsciously grew wounded at heart, and as she wept along with her,"Mr. Secundus," she ventured, "is your ladyship's own child, so howcould you not love him? Even we, who are mere servants, think it a pieceof good fortune when we can wait on him for a time, and all parties canenjoy peace and quiet. But if he begins to behave in this manner, evenpeace and quiet will be completely out of the question for us. On whatday, and at what hour, don't I advise Mr. Secundus; yet I can't manageto stir him up by any advice! But it happens that all that crew are everready to court his friendship, so it isn't to be wondered that he iswhat he is! The truth is that he thinks the advice we give him is notright and proper! As you have to-day, Madame, alluded to this subject,I've got something to tell you which has weighed heavy on my mind. I'vebeen anxious to come and confide it to your ladyship and to solicit yourguidance, but I've been in fear and dread lest you should give way tosuspicion. For not only would then all my disclosures have been in vain,but I would have deprived myself of even a piece of ground wherein myremains could be laid."
Madame Wang perceived that her remarks were prompted by some purpose."My dear child," she eagerly urged; "go on, speak out! When I recentlyheard one and all praise you secretly behind your back, I simply fanciedthat it was because you were careful in your attendance on Pao-yue; orpossibly because you got on well with every one; all on account of minorconsiderations like these; (but I never thought it was on account ofyour good qualities). As it happens, what you told me just now concerns,in all its bearings, a great principle, and is in perfect accord with myideas, so speak out freely, if you have aught to say! Only let no oneelse know anything about it, that is all that is needed."
"I've got nothing more to say," proceeded Hsi Jen. "My sole idea was tosolicit your advice, Madame, as to how to devise a plan to induce Mr.Secundus to move his quarters out of the garden by and bye, as thingswill get all right then."
This allusion much alarmed Madame Wang. Speedily taking Hsi Jen's handin hers: "Is it likely," she inquired, "that Pao-yue has been up to anymischief with any one?"
"Don't be too suspicious!" precipitately replied Hsi Jen. "It wasn't atanything of the kind that I was hinting. I merely expressed my humbleopinion. Mr. Secundus is a young man now, and the young ladies insideare no more children. More than that, Miss Lin and Miss Pao may be twofemale maternal first cousins of his, but albeit his cousins, there isnevertheless the distinction of male and female between them; and dayand night, as they are together, it isn't always convenient, when theyhave to rise and when they have to sit; so this cannot help making onegive way to misgivings. Were, in fact, any outsider to see what's goingon, it would not look like the propriety, which should exist in greatfamilies. The proverb appositely says that: 'when there's no trouble,one should make provision for the time of trouble.' How many concernsthere are in the world, of which there's no making head or tail, mostlybecause what persons do without any design is construed by suchdesigning people, as chance to have their notice attracted to it, ashaving been designedly accomplished, and go on talking and talking till,instead of mending matters, they make them worse! But if precautions benot taken beforehand, something improper will surely happen, for yourladyship is well aware of the temperament Mr. Secundus has shown allalong! Besides, his great weakness is to fuss in our midst, so if nocaution be exercised, and the slightest mistake be sooner or latercommitted, there'll be then no question of true or false: for whenpeople are many one says one thing and another, and what is there thatthe months of that mean lot will shun with any sign of respect? Why, iftheir hearts be well disposed, they will maintain that he is farsuperior to Buddha himself. But if their hearts be badly disposed, theywill at once knit a tissue of lies to show that he cannot even reach thestandard of a beast! Now, if people by and bye speak well of Mr.Secundus, we'll all go on smoothly with our lives. But should heperchance give reason to any one to breathe the slightest disparagingremark, won't his body, needless for us to say, be smashed to pieces,his bones ground to powder, and the blame, which he might incur, be madeten thousand times more serious than it is? These things are allcommonplace trifles; but won't Mr. Secundus' name and reputation besubsequently done for for life? Secondly, it's no easy thing for yourladyship to see anything of our master. A proverb also says: 'Theperfect man makes provision beforehand;' so wouldn't it be better thatwe should, this very minute, adopt such steps as will enable us to guardagainst such things? Your ladyship has much to attend to, and youcouldn't, of course, think of these things in a moment. And as for us,it would have been well and good, had they never suggested themselves toour minds; but since they have, we should be the more to blame did wenot tell you anything about them, Madame. Of late, I have racked mymind, both day and night on this score; and though I couldn't very wellconfide to any one, my lamp alone knows everything!"
After listening to these words, Madame Wang felt as if she had beenblasted by thunder and struck by lightning; and, as they fitted soappositely with the incident connected with Chin Ch'uan-erh, her heartwas more than ever fired with boundless affection for Hsi Jen. "My deargirl," she promptly smiled, "it's you, who are gifted with enoughforesight to be able to think of these things so thoroughly. Yet, did Inot also think of them? But so busy have I been these several times thatthey slipped from my memory. What you've told me to-day, however, hasbrought me to my senses! It's, thanks to you, that the reputation of me,his mother, and of him, my son, is preserved intact! I really never hadthe faintest idea that you were so excellent! But you had better go now;I know of a way. Yet, just another word. After your remarks to me, I'llhand him over to your charge; please be careful of him. If you preservehim from harm, it will be tantamount to preserving me from harm, and Ishall certainly not be ungrateful to you for it."
Hsi Jen said several consecutive yes's, and went on her way. She gotback just in time to see Pao-yue awake. Hsi Jen explained all about thescented water; and, so intensely delighted was Pao-yue, that he at onceasked that some should be mixed and brought to him to taste. In verydeed, he found it unusually fragrant and good. But as his heart was aprey to anxiety on Tai-yue's behalf, he was full of longings to despatchsome one to look her up. He was, however, afraid of Hsi Jen. Readilytherefore he devised a plan to first get Hsi Jen out of the way, bydespatching her to Pao-ch'ai's, to borrow a book. After Hsi Jen'sdeparture, he forthwith called Ch'ing Wen. "Go," he said, "over to MissLin's and see what she's up to. Should she inquire about me, all youneed tell her is that I'm all right."
"What shall I go empty-handed for?" rejoined Ch'ing Wen. "If I were, atleast, to give her a message, it would look as if I had gone forsomething."
"I have no message that you can give her," added Pao-yue.
"If it can't be that," suggested Ch'ing Wen; "I might either takesomething over or fetch something. Otherwise, when I get there, whatexcuse will I be able to find?"
After some cogitation, Pao-yue stretched out his hand and, laying hold ofa couple of handkerchiefs, he threw them to Ch'ing Wen. "These will do,"he smiled. "Just tell her that I bade you take them to her."
"This is strange!" exclaimed Ch'ing Wen. "Will she accept these two halfworn-out handkerchiefs! She'll besides get angry and say that you weremaking fun of her."
"Don't worry yourself about that;" laughed Pao-yue. "She will certainlyknow what I mean."
Ch'ing Wen, at this rejoinder, had no help but to take the handkerchiefsand to go to the Hsiao Hsiang lodge, where she discovered Ch'un Hsien inthe act of hanging out handkerchiefs on the railings to dry. As soon asshe saw her walk in, she vehemently waved her hand. "She's gone tosleep!" she said. Ch'ing Wen, however, entered the room. It was inperfect darkness. There was not even so much as a lantern burning, andTai-yue was already ensconced in bed. "Who is there?" she shouted.
"It's Ch'ing Wen!" promptly replied Ch'ing Wen.
"What are you up to?" Tai-yue inquired.
"Mr. Secundus," explained Ch'ing Wen, "sends you some handkerchiefs,Miss."
Tai-yue's spirits sunk as soon as she caught her reply. "What can he havesent me handkerchiefs for?" she secretly reasoned within herself. "Whogave him these handkerchiefs?" she then asked aloud. "They must be fineones, so tell him to keep them and give them to some one else; for Idon't need such things at present."
"They're not new," smiled Ch'ing Wen. "They are of an ordinary kind, andold."
Hearing this, Lin Tai-yue felt downcast. But after minutely searching herheart, she at last suddenly grasped his meaning and she hastilyobserved: "Leave them and go your way."
Ch'ing Wen was compelled to put them down; and turning round, she betookherself back again. But much though she turned things over in her mindduring the whole of her way homewards, she did not succeed in solvingtheir import.
When Tai-yue guessed the object of the handkerchief, her very soulunawares flitted from her. "As Pao-yue has gone to such pains," shepondered, "to try and probe this dejection of mine, I have, on one hand,sufficient cause to feel gratified; but as there's no knowing what mydejection will come to in the future there is, on the other, enough tomake me sad. Here he abruptly and deliberately sends me a couple ofhandkerchiefs; and, were it not that he has divined my inmost feelings,the mere sight of these handkerchiefs would be enough to make me treatthe whole thing as ridiculous. The secret exchange of presents betweenus," she went on to muse, "fills me also with fears; and the thoughtthat those tears, which I am ever so fond of shedding to myself, are ofno avail, drives me likewise to blush with shame."
And by dint of musing and reflecting, her heart began, in a moment, tobubble over with such excitement that, much against her will, herthoughts in their superabundance rolled on incessantly. So speedilydirecting that a lamp should be lighted, she little concerned herselfabout avoiding suspicion, shunning the use of names, or any other suchthings, and set to work and rubbed the ink, soaked the pen, and thenwrote the following stanzas on the two old handkerchiefs:
  Vain in my eyes the tears collect; those tears in vain they flow,  Which I in secret shed; they slowly drop; but for whom though?  The silk kerchiefs, which he so kindly troubled to give me,  How ever could they not with anguish and distress fill me?
The second ran thus:
  Like falling pearls or rolling gems, they trickle on the sly.  Daily I have no heart for aught; listless all day am I.  As on my pillow or sleeves' edge I may not wipe them dry,  I let them dot by dot, and drop by drop to run freely.
And the third:
  The coloured thread cannot contain the pearls cov'ring my face.  Tears were of old at Hsiang Chiang shed, but faint has waxed each      trace.  Outside my window thousands of bamboos, lo, also grow,  But whether they be stained with tears or not, I do not know.
Lin Tai-yue was still bent upon going on writing, but feeling her wholebody burn like fire, and her face scalding hot, she advanced towards thecheval-glass, and, raising the embroidered cover, she looked in. She sawat a glance that her cheeks wore so red that they, in very truth, puteven the peach blossom to the shade. Yet little did she dream that fromthis date her illness would assume a more serious phase. Shortly, shethrew herself on the bed, and, with the handkerchiefs still grasped inher hand, she was lost in a reverie.
Putting her aside, we will now take up our story with Hsi Jen. She wentto pay a visit to Pao-ch'ai, but as it happened, Pao-ch'ai was not inthe garden, but had gone to look up her mother. Hsi Jen, however, couldnot very well come back with empty hands so she waited until the secondwatch, when Pao-ch'ai eventually returned to her quarters.
Indeed, so correct an estimate of Hsueeh P'an's natural disposition didPao-ch'ai ever have, that from an early moment she entertained withinherself some faint suspicion that it must have been Hsueeh P'an, who hadinstigated some person or other to come and lodge a complaint againstPao-yue. And when she also unexpectedly heard Hsi Jen's disclosures onthe subject, she became more positive in her surmises. The one, who had,in fact, told Hsi Jen was Pei Ming. But Pei Ming too had arrived at theconjecture in his own mind, and could not adduce any definite proof, sothat every one treated his statements as founded partly on meresuppositions, and partly on actual facts; but, despite this, they feltquite certain that it was (Hsueeh P'an) who had intrigued.
Hsueeh P'an had always enjoyed this reputation; but on this particularinstance the harm was not, actually, his own doing; yet as every one,with one consent, tenaciously affirmed that it was he, it was no easymatter for him, much though he might argue, to clear himself of blame.
Soon after his return, on this day, from a drinking bout out of doors,he came to see his mother; but finding Pao-ch'ai in her rooms, theyexchanged a few irrelevant remarks. "I hear," he consequently asked,"that cousin Pao-yue has got into trouble; why is it?"
Mrs. Hsueeh was at the time much distressed on this score. As soontherefore as she caught this question, she gnashed her teeth with rage,and shouted: "You good-for-nothing spiteful fellow! It's all you who areat the bottom of this trouble; and do you still have the face to comeand ply me with questions?"
These words made Hsueeh P'an wince. "When did I stir up any trouble?" hequickly asked.
"Do you still go on shamming!" cried Mrs. Hsueeh. "Every one knows fullwell that it was you, who said those things, and do you yetprevaricate?"
"Were every one," insinuated Hsueeh P'an, "to assert that I had committedmurder, would you believe even that?"
"Your very sister is well aware that they were said by you." Mrs. Hsueehcontinued, "and is it likely that she would accuse you falsely, pray?"
"Mother," promptly interposed Pao-ch'ai, "you shouldn't be brawling withbrother just now! If you wait quietly, we'll find out the plain andhonest truth." Then turning towards Hsueeh P'an: "Whether it's you, whosaid those things or not," she added, "it's of no consequence. The wholeaffair, besides, is a matter of the past, so what need is there for anyarguments; they will only be making a mountain of a mole-hill! I havejust one word of advice to give you; don't, from henceforward, be up toso much reckless mischief outside; and concern yourself a little lesswith other people's affairs! All you do is day after day to associatewith your friends and foolishly gad about! You are a happy-go-lucky sortof creature! If nothing happens well and good; but should by and byeanything turn up, every one will, though it be none of your doing,imagine again that you are at the bottom of it! Not to speak of others,why I myself will be the first to suspect you!"
Hsueeh P'an was naturally open-hearted and plain-spoken, and could notbrook anything in the way of innuendoes, so, when on the one side,Pao-ch'ai advised him not to foolishly gad about, and his mother, on theother, hinted that he had a foul tongue, and that he was the cause thatPao-yue had been flogged, he at once got so exasperated that he jumpedabout in an erratic manner and did all in his power, by vowing andswearing, to explain matters. "Who has," he ejaculated, heaping abuseupon every one, "laid such a tissue of lies to my charge! I'd like totake the teeth of that felon and pull them out! It's clear as day thatthey shove me forward as a target; for now that Pao-yue has been floggedthey find no means of making a display of their zeal. But, is Pao-yueforsooth the lord of the heavens that because he has had a thrashingfrom his father, the whole household should be fussing for days? Theother time, he behaved improperly, and my uncle gave him two whacks. Butour venerable ancestor came, after a time, somehow or other, I don'tknow how, to hear about it, and, maintaining that it was all due to Mr.Chia Chen, she called him before her, and gave him a good blowing up.And here to-day, they have gone further, and involved me. They may dragme in as much as they like, I don't fear a rap! But won't it be betterfor me to go into the garden, and take Pao-yue and give him a bit of mymind and kill him? I can then pay the penalty by laying down my life forhis, and one and all will enjoy peace and quiet!"
While he clamoured and shouted, he looked about him for the bar of thedoor, and, snatching it up, he there and then was running off, to theconsternation of Mrs. Hsueeh, who clutched him in her arms. "Youmurderous child of retribution!" she cried. "Whom would you go and beat?come first and assail me?"
From excitement Hsueeh P'an's eyes protruded like copper bells. "What areyou up to," he vociferated, "that you won't let me go where I please,and that you deliberately go on calumniating me? But every day thatPao-yue lives, the longer by that day I have to bear a false charge, soit's as well that we should both die that things be cleared up?"
Pao-ch'ai too hurriedly rushed forward. "Be patient a bit!" she exhortedhim. "Here's mamma in an awful state of despair. Not to mention that itshould be for you to come and pacify her, you contrariwise kick up allthis rumpus! Why, saying nothing about her who is your parent, were evena perfect stranger to advise you, it would be meant for your good! Butthe good counsel she gave you has stirred up your monkey instead."
"From the way you're now speaking," Hsueeh P'an rejoined, "it must beyou, who said that it was I; no one else but you!"
"You simply know how to feel displeased with me for speaking," arguedPao-ch'ai, "but you don't feel displeased with yourself for thatreckless way of yours of looking ahead and not minding what is behind!"
"You now bear me a grudge," Hsueeh P'an added, "for looking to what isahead and not to what is behind; but how is it you don't feel indignantwith Pao-yue for stirring up strife and provoking trouble outside?Leaving aside everything else, I'll merely take that affair of Ch'iKuan-erh's, which occurred the other day, and recount it to you as aninstance. My friends and I came across this Ch'i Kuan-erh, ten times atleast, but never has he made a single intimate remark to me, and how isit that, as soon as he met Pao-yue the other day, he at once produced hissash, and gave it to him, though he did not so much as know what hissurname and name were? Now is it likely, forsooth, that this too wassomething that I started?"
"Do you still refer to this?" exclaimed Mrs. Hsueeh and Pao-ch'ai, out ofpatience. "Wasn't it about this that he was beaten? This makes it clearenough that it's you who gave the thing out."
"Really, you're enough to exasperate one to death!" Hsueeh P'anexclaimed. "Had you confined yourselves to saying that I had started theyarn, I wouldn't have lost my temper; but what irritates me is that sucha fuss should be made for a single Pao-yue, as to subvert heaven andearth!"
"Who fusses?" shouted Pao-ch'ai. "You are the first to arm yourself tothe teeth and start a row, and then you say that it's others who are upto mischief!"
Hsueeh P'an, seeing that every remark, made by Pao-ch'ai, contained somuch reasonableness that he could with difficulty refute it, and thather words were even harder for him to reply to than were those utteredby his mother, he was consequently bent upon contriving a plan to makeuse of such language as could silence her and compel her to return toher room, so as to have no one bold enough to interfere with hisspeaking; but, his temper being up, he was not in a position to weighhis speech. "Dear Sister!" he readily therefore said, "you needn't beflying into a huff with me! I've long ago divined your feelings. Mothertold me some time back that for you with that gold trinket, must beselected some suitor provided with a jade one; as such a one will be asuitable match for you. And having treasured this in your mind, and seenthat Pao-yue has that rubbishy thing of his, you naturally now seizeevery occasion to screen him...."
However, before he could finish, Pao-ch'ai trembled with anger, andclinging to Mrs. Hsueeh, she melted into tears. "Mother," she observed,"have you heard what brother says, what is it all about?"
Hsueeh P'an, at the sight of his sister bathed in tears, became alive tothe fact that he had spoken inconsiderately, and, flying into a rage, hewalked away to his own quarters and retired to rest. But we can welldispense with any further comment on the subject.
Pao-ch'ai was, at heart, full of vexation and displeasure. She meant togive vent to her feelings in some way, but the fear again of upsettingher mother compelled her to conceal her tears. She therefore took leaveof her parent, and went back all alone. On her return to her chamber,she sobbed and sobbed throughout the whole night. The next day, she gotout of bed, as soon as it dawned; but feeling even no inclination tocomb her chevelure or perform her ablutions, she carelessly adjusted herclothes and came out of the garden to see her mother.
As luck would have it, she encountered Tai-yue standing alone under theshade of the trees, who inquired of her: "Where she was off to?"
"I'm going home," Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai replied. And as she uttered thesewords, she kept on her way.
But Tai-yue perceived that she was going off in a disconsolate mood; and,noticing that her eyes betrayed signs of crying, and that her manner wasunlike that of other days, she smilingly called out to her from behind:"Sister, you should take care of yourself a bit. Were you even to cry somuch as to fill two water jars with tears, you wouldn't heal the woundsinflicted by the cane."
But as what reply Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai gave is not yet known to you, reader,lend an ear to the explanation contained in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XXXV.
  Pai Yue-ch'uan tastes too the lotus-leaf soup.  Huang Chin-ying skilfully plaits the plum-blossom-knotted nets.
Pao ch'ai had, our story goes, distinctly heard Lin Tai-yue's sneer, butin her eagerness to see her mother and brother, she did not so much asturn her head round, but continued straight on her way.
During this time, Lin Tai-yue halted under the shadow of the trees. Uponcasting a glance, in the distance towards the I Hung Yuean, she observedLi Kung-ts'ai, Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and various inmateswending their steps in a body in the direction of the I Hung court; butafter they had gone past, and company after company of them haddispersed, she only failed to see lady Feng come. "How is it," shecogitated within herself, "that she doesn't come to see Pao-yue? Evensupposing that there was some business to detain her, she should alsohave put in an appearance, so as to curry favour with our venerablesenior and Madame Wang. But if she hasn't shown herself at this hour ofthe day, there must certainly be some cause or other."
While preoccupied with conjectures, she raised her head. At a secondglance, she discerned a crowd of people, as thick as flowers in abouquet, pursuing their way also into the I Hung court. On lookingfixedly, she recognised dowager lady Chia, leaning on lady Feng's arm,followed by Mesdames Hsing and Wang, Mrs. Chou and servant-girls,married women and other domestics. In a body they walked into the court.At the sight of them, Tai-yue unwittingly nodded her head, and reflectedon the benefit of having a father and mother; and tears forthwith againbedewed her face. In a while, she beheld Pao-ch'ai, Mrs. Hsueeh and therest likewise go in.
But at quite an unexpected moment she became aware that Tzu Chuean wasapproaching her from behind. "Miss," she said, "you had better go andtake your medicine! The hot water too has got cold."
"What do you, after all, mean by keeping on pressing me so?" inquiredTai-yue. "Whether I have it or not, what's that to you?"
"Your cough," smiled Tzu Chuean, "has recently got a trifle better, andwon't you again take your medicine? This is, it's true, the fifth moon,and the weather is hot, but you should, nevertheless, take good care ofyourself a bit! Here you've been at this early hour of the morningstanding for ever so long in this damp place; so you should go back andhave some rest!"
This single hint recalled Tai-yue to her senses. She at length realisedthat her legs felt rather tired. After lingering about abstractedly fora long while, she quietly returned into the Hsiao Hsiang lodge,supporting herself on Tzu Chuean. As soon as they stepped inside theentrance of the court, her gaze was attracted by the confused shadows ofthe bamboos, which covered the ground, and the traces of moss, herethick, there thin, and she could not help recalling to mind those twolines of the passage in the Hsi Hsiang Chi:
  "In that lone nook some one saunters about,  White dew coldly bespecks the verdant moss."
"Shuang Wen," she consequently secretly communed within herself, as shesighed, "had of course a poor fate; but she nevertheless had a widowedmother and a young brother; but in the unhappy destiny, to which I,Tai-yue, am at present doomed, I have neither a widowed mother nor ayoung brother."
At this point in her reflections, she was about to melt into another fitof crying, when of a sudden, the parrot under the verandah caught sightof Tai-yue approaching, and, with a shriek, he jumped down from hisperch, and made her start with fright.
"Are you bent upon compassing your own death!" she exclaimed. "You'vecovered my head all over with dust again!"
The parrot flew back to his perch. "Hsueeh Yen," he kept on shouting,"quick, raise the portiere! Miss is come!"
Tai-yue stopped short and rapped on the frame with her hand. "Have hisfood and water been replenished?" she asked.
The parrot forthwith heaved a deep sigh, closely resembling, in sound,the groans usually indulged in by Tai-yue, and then went on to recite:
  "Here I am fain these flowers to inter, but humankind will laugh me as      a fool."  Who knows who will in years to come commit me to my grave.
As soon as these lines fell on the ear of Tai-yue and Tzu Chuean, theyblurted out laughing.
"This is what you were repeating some time back, Miss." Tzu Chueanlaughed, "How did he ever manage to commit it to memory?"
Tai-yue then directed some one to take down the frame and suspend itinstead on a hook, outside the circular window, and presently enteringher room, she seated herself inside the circular window. She had justdone drinking her medicine, when she perceived that the shade cast bythe cluster of bamboos, planted outside the window, was reflected so faron the gauze lattice as to fill the room with a faint light, so greenand mellow, and to impart a certain coolness to the teapoys and mats.But Tai-yue had no means at hand to dispel her ennui, so from inside thegauze lattice, she instigated the parrot to perform his pranks; andselecting some verses, which had ever found favour with her, she triedto teach them to him.
But without descending to particulars, let us now advert to HsueehPao-ch'ai. On her return home, she found her mother alone combing herhair and having a wash. "Why do you run over at this early hour of themorning?" she speedily inquired when she saw her enter.
"To see," replied Pao-ch'ai, "whether you were all right or not, mother.Did he come again, I wonder, after I left yesterday and make any moretrouble or not?"
As she spoke, she sat by her mother's side, but unable to curb hertears, she began to weep.
Seeing her sobbing, Mrs. Hsueeh herself could not check her feelings, andshe, too, burst out into a fit of crying. "My child," she simultaneouslyexhorted her, "don't feel aggrieved! Wait, and I'll call that child ofwrath to order; for were anything to happen to you, from whom will Ihave anything to hope?"
Hsueeh P'an was outside and happened to overhear their conversation, sowith alacrity he ran over, and facing Pao-ch'ai he made a bow, now tothe left and now to the right, observing the while: "My dear sister,forgive me this time. The fact is that I took some wine yesterday; Icame back late, as I met a few friends on the way. On my return home, Ihadn't as yet got over the fumes, so I unintentionally talked a lot ofnonsense. But I don't so much as remember anything about all I said. Itisn't worth your while, however, losing your temper over such a thing!"
Pao-ch'ai was, in fact, weeping, as she covered her face, but the momentthis language fell on her ear, she could scarcely again refrain fromlaughing. Forthwith raising her head, she sputtered contemptuously onthe ground. "You can well dispense with all this sham!" she exclaimed,"I'm well aware that you so dislike us both, that you're anxious todevise some way of inducing us to part company with you, so that you maybe at liberty."
Hsueeh P'an, at these words, hastened to smile. "Sister," he argued,"what makes you say so? once upon a time, you weren't so suspicious andgiven to uttering anything so perverse!"
Mrs. Hsueeh hurriedly took up the thread of the conversation. "All youknow," she interposed, "is to find fault with your sister's remarks asbeing perverse; but can it be that what you said last night was theproper thing to say? In very truth, you were drunk!"
"There's no need for you to get angry, mother!" Hsueeh P'an rejoined,"nor for you sister either; for from this day, I shan't any more makecommon cause with them nor drink wine or gad about. What do you say tothat?"
"That's equal to an acknowledgment of your failings," Pao-ch'ai laughed.
"Could you exercise such strength of will," added Mrs. Hsueeh, "why, thedragon too would lay eggs."
"If I again go and gad about with them," Hsueeh P'an replied, "and you,sister, come to hear of it, you can freely spit in my face and call me abeast and no human being. Do you agree to that? But why should you twobe daily worried; and all through me alone? For you, mother, to be angryon my account is anyhow excusable; but for me to keep on worrying you,sister, makes me less then ever worthy of the name of a human being! Ifnow that father is no more, I manage, instead of showing you plenty offilial piety, mamma, and you, sister, plenty of love, to provoke mymother to anger, and annoy my sister, why I can't compare myself to evena four-footed creature!"
While from his mouth issued these words, tears rolled down from hiseyes; for he too found it hard to contain them.
Mrs. Hsueeh had not at first been overcome by her feelings; but themoment his utterances reached her ear, she once more began to experiencethe anguish, which they stirred in her heart.
Pao-ch'ai made an effort to force a smile. "You've already," she said,"been the cause of quite enough trouble, and do you now provoke motherto have another cry?"
Hearing this, Hsueeh P'an promptly checked his tears. As he put on asmiling expression, "When did I," he asked, "make mother cry? But nevermind; enough of this! let's drop the matter, and not allude to it anymore! Call Hsiang Ling to come and give you a cup of tea, sister!"
"I don't want any tea." Pao-ch'ai answered. "I'll wait until mother hasfinished washing her hands and then go with her into the garden."
"Let me see your necklet, sister," Hsueeh P'an continued. "I think itrequires cleaning."
"It is so yellow and bright," rejoined Pao-ch'ai, "and what's the use ofcleaning it again?"
"Sister," proceeded Hsueeh P'an, "you must now add a few more clothes toyour wardrobe, so tell me what colour and what design you like best."
"I haven't yet worn out all the clothes I have," Pao-ch'ai explained,"and why should I have more made?"
But, in a little time, Mrs. Hsueeh effected the change in her costume,and hand in hand with Pao-ch'ai, she started on her way to the garden.
Hsueeh P'an thereupon took his departure. During this while, Mrs. Hsueehand Pao-ch'ai trudged in the direction of the garden to look up Pao-yue.As soon as they reached the interior of the I Hung court, they saw alarge concourse of waiting-maids and matrons standing inside as well asoutside the antechambers and they readily concluded that old lady Chiaand the other ladies were assembled in his rooms. Mrs. Hsueeh and herdaughter stepped in. After exchanging salutations with every onepresent, they noticed that Pao-yue was reclining on the couch and Mrs.Hsueeh inquired of him whether he felt any better.
Pao-yue hastily attempted to bow. "I'm considerably better;" he said."All I do," he went on, "is to disturb you, aunt, and you, my cousin,but I don't deserve such attentions."
Mrs. Hsueeh lost no time in supporting and laying him down. "Mind youtell me whatever may take your fancy!" she proceeded.
"If I do fancy anything," retorted Pao-yue smilingly, "I shall certainlysend to you, aunt, for it."
"What would you like to eat," likewise inquired Madame Wang, "so that Imay, on my return, send it round to you?"
"There's nothing that I care for," smiled Pao-yue, "though the soup madefor me the other day, with young lotus leaves, and small lotus coreswas, I thought, somewhat nice."
"From what I hear, its flavour is nothing very grand," lady Feng chimedin laughingly, from where she stood on one side. "It involves, however,a good deal of trouble to concoct; and here you deliberately go andfancy this very thing."
"Go and get it ready!" cried dowager lady Chia several successive times.
"Venerable ancestor," urged lady Feng with a smile, "don't you botheryourself about it! Let me try and remember who can have put the mouldsaway!" Then turning her head round, "Go and bid," she enjoined an oldmatron, "the chief in the cook-house go and apply for them!"
After a considerable lapse of time, the matron returned. "The chief inthe cook-house," she explained, "says that the four sets of moulds forsoups have all been handed up."
Upon hearing this, lady Feng thought again for a while. "Yes, Iremember," she afterwards remarked, "they were handed up, but I can'trecollect to whom they were given. Possibly they're in the tea-room."
Thereupon, she also despatched a servant to go and inquire of the keeperof the tea-room about them; but he too had not got them; and it wassubsequently the butler, entrusted with the care of the gold and silverarticles, who brought them round.
Mrs. Hsueeh was the first to take them and examine them. What, in fact,struck her gaze was a small box, the contents of which were four sets ofsilver moulds. Each of these was over a foot long, and one square inch(in breadth). On the top, holes were bored of the size of beans. Someresembled chrysanthemums, others plum blossom. Some were in the shape oflotus seed-cases, others like water chestnuts. They numbered in allthirty or forty kinds, and were ingeniously executed.
"In your mansion," she felt impelled to observe smilingly to old ladyChia and Madame Wang, "everything has been amply provided for! Have yougot all these things to prepare a plate of soup with! Hadn't you toldme, and I happened to see them, I wouldn't have been able to make outwhat they were intended for!"
Lady Feng did not allow time to any one to put in her word. "Aunt," shesaid, "how could you ever have divined that these were used last yearfor the imperial viands! They thought of a way by which they devised,somehow or other, I can't tell how, some dough shapes, which borrow alittle of the pure fragrance of the new lotus leaves. But as all mainlydepends upon the quality of the soup, they're not, after all, of muchuse! Yet who often goes in for such soup! It was made once only, andthat at the time when the moulds were brought; and how is it that he hascome to think of it to-day?" So speaking, she took (the moulds), andhanded them to a married woman, to go and issue directions to the peoplein the cook-house to procure at once several fowls, and to add otheringredients besides and prepare ten bowls of soup.
"What do you want all that lot for?" observed Madame Wang.
"There's good reason for it," answered lady Feng. "A dish of this kindisn't, at ordinary times, very often made, and were, now that brotherPao-yue has alluded to it, only sufficient prepared for him, and none foryou, dear senior, you, aunt, and you, Madame Wang, it won't be quite thething! So isn't it better that this opportunity should be availed of toget ready a whole supply so that every one should partake of some, andthat even I should, through my reliance on your kind favour, taste thisnovel kind of relish."
"You are sharper than a monkey!" Dowager lady Chia laughingly exclaimedin reply to her proposal. "You make use of public money to confer boonsupon people."
This remark evoked general laughter.
"This is a mere bagatelle!" eagerly laughed lady Feng. "Even I canafford to stand you such a small treat!" Then turning her head round,"Tell them in the cook-house," she said to a married woman, "to pleasemake an extra supply, and that they'll get the money from me."
The matron assented and went out of the room.
Pao-ch'ai, who was standing near, thereupon interposed with a smile."During the few years that have gone by since I've come here, I'vecarefully noticed that sister-in-law Secunda, cannot, with all heracumen, outwit our venerable ancestor."
"My dear child!" forthwith replied old lady Chia at these words. "I'mnow quite an old woman, and how can there still remain any wit in me!When I was, long ago, of your manlike cousin Feng's age, I had far morewits about me than she has! Albeit she now avers that she can't reachour standard, she's good enough; and compared with your aunt Wang, why,she's infinitely superior. Your aunt, poor thing, won't speak much!She's like a block of wood; and when with her father and mother-in-law,she won't show herself off to advantage. But that girl Feng has a sharptongue, so is it a wonder if people take to her."
"From what you say," insinuated Pao-yue with a smile, "those who don'ttalk much are not loved."
"Those who don't speak much," resumed dowager lady Chia, "possess theendearing quality of reserve. But among those, with glib tongues,there's also a certain despicable lot; thus it's better, in a word, notto have too much to say for one's self."
"Quite so," smiled Pao-yue, "yet though senior sister-in-law Chia Chudoesn't, I must confess, talk much, you, venerable ancestor, treat herjust as you do cousin Feng. But if you maintain that those alone, whocan talk, are worthy of love, then among all these young ladies, sisterFeng and cousin Lin are the only ones good enough to be loved."
"With regard to the young ladies," remarked dowager lady Chia, "it isn'tthat I have any wish to flatter your aunt Hsueeh in her presence, but itis a positive and incontestable fact that there isn't, beginning fromthe four girls in our household, a single one able to hold a candle tothat girl Pao-ch'ai."
At these words, Mrs. Hsueeh promptly smiled. "Dear venerable senior!" shesaid, "you're rather partial in your verdict."
"Our dear senior," vehemently put in Madame Wang, also smiling, "hasoften told me in private how nice your daughter Pao-ch'ai is; so this isno lie."
Pao-yue had tried to lead old lady Chia on, originally with the idea ofinducing her to speak highly of Lin Tai-yue, but when unawares she beganto eulogise Pao-ch'ai instead the result exceeded all his thoughts andwent far beyond his expectations. Forthwith he cast a glance atPao-chai, and gave her a smile, but Pao-chai at once twisted her headround and went and chatted with Hsi Jen. But of a sudden, some one cameto ask them to go and have their meal. Dowager lady Chia rose to herfeet, and enjoined Pao-yue to be careful of himself. She then gave a fewdirections to the waiting-maids, and resting her weight on lady Feng'sarm, and pressing Mrs. Hsueeh to go out first, she, and all with her,left the apartment in a body. But still she kept on inquiring whetherthe soup was ready or not. "If there's anything you might fancy to eat,"she also said to Mrs. Hsueeh and the others, "mind you, come and tell me,and I know how to coax that hussey Feng to get it for you as well asme."
"My venerable senior!" rejoined Mrs. Hsueeh, "you do have the happy knackof putting her on her mettle; but though she has often got things readyfor you, you've, after all, not eaten very much of them."
"Aunt," smiled lady Feng, "don't make such statements! If our worthysenior hasn't eaten me up it's purely and simply because she dislikeshuman flesh as being sour. Did she not look down upon it as sour, why,she would long ago have gobbled me up!"
This joke was scarcely ended, when it so tickled the fancy of old ladyChia and all the inmates that they broke out with one voice in aboisterous fit of laughter. Even Pao-yue, who was inside the room, couldnot keep quiet.
"Really," Hsi Jen laughed, "the mouth of our mistress Secunda is enoughto terrify people to death!"
Pao-yue put out his arm and pulled Hsi Jen. "You've been standing for solong," he smiled, "that you must be feeling tired."
Saying this, he dragged her down and made her take a seat next to him.
"Here you've again forgotten!" laughingly exclaimed Hsi Jen. "Availyourself now that Miss Pao-ch'ai is in the court to tell her to kindlybid their Ying Erh come and plait a few girdles with twisted cords."
"How lucky it is you've reminded me?" Pao-yue observed with a smile. Andputting, while he spoke, his head out of the window: "Cousin Pao-ch'ai,"he cried, "when you've had your repast, do tell Ying Erh to come over. Iwould like to ask her to plait a few girdles for me. Has she got thetime to spare?"
Pao-ch'ai heard him speak; and turning round: "How about no time?" sheanswered. "I'll tell her by and bye to come; it will be all right."
Dowager lady Chia and the others, however, failed to catch distinctlythe drift of their talk; and they halted and made inquiries of Pao-ch'aiwhat it was about. Pao-ch'ai gave them the necessary explanations.
"My dear child," remarked old lady Chia, "do let her come and twist afew girdles for your cousin! And should you be in need of any one foranything, I have over at my place a whole number of servant-girls doingnothing! Out of them, you are at liberty to send for any you like towait on you!"
"We'll send her to plait them!" Mrs. Hsueeh and Pao-ch'ai observedsmilingly with one consent. "What can we want her for? she also dailyidles her time way and is up to every mischief!"
But chatting the while, they were about to proceed on their way whenthey unexpectedly caught sight of Hsiang-yuen, P'ing Erh, Hsiang Lin andother girls picking balsam flowers near the rocks; who, as soon as theysaw the company approaching, advanced to welcome them.
Shortly, they all sallied out of the garden. Madame Wang was worryinglest dowager lady Chia's strength might be exhausted, and she did herutmost to induce her to enter the drawing room and sit down. Old ladyChia herself was feeling her legs quite tired out, so she at once noddedher head and expressed her assent. Madame Wang then directed awaiting-maid to hurriedly precede them, and get ready the seats. But asMrs. Chao had, about this time, pleaded indisposition, there was onlytherefore Mrs. Chou, with the matrons and servant-girls at hand, so theyhad ample to do to raise the portieres, to put the back-cushions intheir places, and to spread out the rugs.
Dowager lady Chia stepped into the room, leaning on lady Feng's arm. Sheand Mrs. Hsueeh took their places, with due regard to the distinctionbetween hostess and visitors; and Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai and Shih Hsiang-yuenseated themselves below. Madame Wang then came forward, and presentedwith her own hands tea to old lady Chia, while Li Kung-ts'ai handed acup to Mrs. Hsueeh.
"You'd better let those young sisters-in law do the honours,"remonstrated old lady Chia, "and sit over there so that we may be ableto have a chat."
Madame Wang at length sat on a small bench. "Let our worthy senior'sviands," she cried, addressing herself to lady Feng, "be served here.And let a few more things be brought!"
Lady Feng acquiesced without delay, and she told a servant to cross overto their old mistress' quarters and to bid the matrons, employed in thatpart of the household, promptly go out and summon the waiting-girls. Thevarious waiting-maids arrived with all despatch. Madame Wang directedthem to ask their young ladies round. But after a protracted absence onthe errand, only two of the girls turned up: T'an Ch'un and Hsi Ch'un.Ying Ch'un, was not, in her state of health, equal to the fatigue, orable to put anything in her mouth, and Lin Tai-yue, superfluous to add,could only safely partake of five out of ten meals, so no one thoughtanything of their non-appearance. Presently the eatables were brought,and the servants arranged them in their proper places on the table.
Lady Feng took a napkin and wrapped a bundle of chopsticks in it."Venerable ancestor and you, Mrs. Hsueeh," she smiled, standing the whilebelow, "there's no need of any yielding! Just you listen to me and I'llmake things all right."
"Let's do as she wills!" old lady Chia remarked to Mrs. Hsueehlaughingly.
Mrs. Hsueeh signified her approval with a smile; so lady Feng placed, indue course, four pairs of chopsticks on the table; the two pairs on theupper end for dowager lady Chia and Mrs. Hsueeh; those on the two sidesfor Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai and Shih Hsiang-yuen. Madame Wang, Li Kung-ts'ai anda few others, stood together below and watched the attendants serve theviands. Lady Feng first and foremost hastily asked for clean utensils,and drew near the table to select some eatables for Pao-yue. Presently,the soup _a la_ lotus leaves arrived. After old lady Chia had wellscrutinised it, Madame Wang turned her head, and catching sight of YueCh'uan-erh, she immediately commissioned her to take some over toPao-yue.
"She can't carry it single-handed," demurred lady Feng.
But by a strange coincidence, Ying Erh then walked into the room alongwith Hsi Erh, and Pao-ch'ai knowing very well that they had already hadtheir meal forthwith said to Ying Erh: "Your Master Secundus, Mr.Pao-yue, just asked that you should go and twist a few girdles for him;so you two might as well proceed together!"
Ying Erh expressed her readiness and left the apartment, in company withYue Ch'uan-erh.
"How can you carry it, so very hot as it is, the whole way there?"observed Ying Erh.
"Don't distress yourself!" rejoined Yue Ch'uan smiling. "I know how to doit."
Saying this, she directed a matron to come and place the soup, rice andthe rest of the eatables in a present box; and bidding her lay hold ofit and follow them, the two girls sped on their way with empty hands,and made straight for the entrance of the I Hung court. Here YueCh'uan-erh at length took the things herself, and entered the room incompany with Ying Erh. The trio, Hsi Jen, She Yueeh and Ch'iu Wen were atthe time chatting and laughing with Pao-yue; but the moment they sawtheir two friends arrive they speedily jumped to their feet. "How isit," they exclaimed laughingly, "that you two drop in just the nick oftime? Have you come together?"
With these words on their lips, they descended to greet them. Yue Ch'uantook at once a seat on a small stool. Ying Erh, however, did not presumeto seat herself; and though Hsi Jen was quick enough in moving afoot-stool for her, Ying Erh did not still venture to sit down.
Ying Erh's arrival filled Pao-yue with intense delight. But as soon as henoticed Yue Ch'uan-erh, he recalled to memory her sister Chin Ch'uan-erh,and he felt wounded to the very heart, and overpowered with shame. And,without troubling his mind about Ying Erh, he addressed his remarks toYue Ch'uan-erh.
Hsi Jen saw very well that Ying Erh failed to attract his attention andshe began to fear lest she felt uncomfortable; and when she furtherrealised that Ying Erh herself would not take a seat, she drew her outof the room and repaired with her into the outer apartment, where theyhad a chat over their tea.
She Yueeh and her companions had, in the meantime, got the bowls andchopsticks ready and came to wait upon (Pao-yue) during his meal. ButPao-yue would not have anything to eat. "Is your mother all right," heforthwith inquired of Yue Ch'uan-erh.
An angry scowl crept over Yue Ch'uan-erh's face. She did not even lookstraight at Pao-yue. And only after a long pause was it that she at lastuttered merely the words, "all right," by way of reply. Pao-yue,therefore, found talking to her of little zest. But after a protractedsilence he felt impelled to again force a smile, and to ask: "Who toldyou to bring these things over to me?"
"The ladies," answered Yue Chuan-erh.
Pao-yue discerned the mournful expression, which still beclouded hercountenance and he readily jumped at the conclusion that it must beentirely occasioned by the fate which had befallen Chin Ch'uan-erh, butwhen fain to put on a meek and unassuming manner, and endeavour to cheerher, he saw how little he could demean himself in the presence of somany people, and consequently he did his best and discovered the meansof getting every one out of the way. Afterwards, straining anothersmile, he plied her with all sorts of questions.
Yue Ch'uan-erh, it is true, did not at first choose to heed his advances,yet when she observed that Pao-yue did not put on any airs, and, that inspite of all her querulous reproaches, he still continued pleasant andagreeable, she felt disconcerted and her features at last assumed acertain expression of cheerfulness. Pao-yue thereupon smiled. "My deargirl," he said, as he gave way to entreaties, "bring that soup and letme taste it!"
"I've never been in the habit of feeding people," Yue Ch'uan-erh replied."You'd better wait till the others return; you can have some then."
"I don't want you to feed me," laughed Pao-yue. "It's because I can'tmove about that I appeal to you. Do let me have it! You'll then get backearly and be able, when you've handed over the things, to have yourmeal. But were I to go on wasting your time, won't you feel upset fromhunger? Should you be lazy to budge, well then, I'll endure the pain andget down and fetch it myself."
As he spoke, he tried to alight from bed. He strained every nerve, andraised himself, but unable to stand the exertion, he burst out intogroans. At the sight of his anguish, Yue Ch'uan-erh had not the heart torefuse her help. Springing up, "Lie down!" she cried. "In what formerexistence did you commit such evil that your retribution in the presentone is so apparent? Which of my eyes however can brook looking at yougoing on in that way?"
While taunting him, she again blurted out laughing, and brought the soupover to him.
"My dear girl;" smiled Pao-yue, "if you want to show temper, better do sohere! When you see our venerable senior and madame, my mother, youshould be a little more even-tempered, for if you still behave likethis, you'll at once get a scolding!"
"Eat away, eat away!" urged Yue Ch'uan-erh. "There's no need for you tobe so sweet-mouthed and honey-tongued with me. I don't put any faith insuch talk!"
So speaking, she pressed Pao-yue until he had two mouthfuls of soup. "Itisn't nice, it isn't nice!" Pao-yue purposely exclaimed.
"Omi-to-fu!" ejaculated Yue Ch'uan-erh. "If this isn't nice, what'snice?"
"There's no flavour about it at all," resumed Pao-yue. "If you don'tbelieve me taste it, and you'll find out for yourself."
Yue Ch'uan-erh in a tantrum actually put some of it to her lips.
"Well," laughed Pao-yue, "it is nice!"
This exclamation eventually enabled Yue Ch'uan to see what Pao-yue wasdriving at, for Pao-yue had in fact been trying to beguile her to have amouthful.
"As, at one moment, you say you don't want any," she forthwith observed,"and now you say it is nice, I won't give you any."
While Pao-yue returned her smiles, he kept on earnestly entreating her tolet him have some.
Yue Ch'uan-erh however would still not give him any; and she, at the sametime, called to the servants to fetch what there was for him to eat. Butthe instant the waiting-maid put her foot into the room, servants camequite unexpectedly to deliver a message.
"Two nurses," they said, "have arrived from the household of Mr. Fu,Secundus, to present his compliments. They have now come to see you, Mr.Secundus." As soon as Pao-yue heard this report, he felt sure that theymust be nurses sent over from the household of Deputy Sub-Prefect, FuShih.
This Fu Shih had originally been a pupil of Chia Cheng, and had, indeed,had to rely entirely upon the reputation enjoyed by the Chia family forthe realisation of his wishes. Chia Cheng had, likewise, treated himwith such genuine regard, and so unlike any of his other pupils, that he(Fu Shih) ever and anon despatched inmates from his mansion to come andsee him so as to keep up friendly relations.
Pao-yue had at all times entertained an aversion for bold-faced men andunsophisticated women, so why did he once more, on this occasion, issuedirections that the two matrons should be introduced into his presence?There was, in fact, a reason for his action. It was simply that Pao-yuehad come to learn that Fu Shih had a sister, Ch'iu-fang by name, a girlas comely as a magnificent gem, and perfection itself, the report ofoutside people went, as much in intellect as in beauty. He had, it istrue, not yet seen anything of her with his own eyes, but thesentiments, which made him think of her and cherish her, from adistance, were characterised by such extreme sincerity, that dreadinglest he should, by refusing to admit the matrons, reflect discredit uponFu Ch'iu-fang, he was prompted to lose no time in expressing a wish thatthey should be ushered in.
This Fu Shih had really risen from the vulgar herd, so seeing thatCh'iu-fang possessed several traits of beauty and exceptionalintellectual talents, Fu Shih arrived at the resolution of making hissister the means of joining relationship with the influential family ofsome honourable clan. And so unwilling was he to promise her lightly toany suitor that things were delayed up to this time. Therefore FuCh'iu-fang, though at present past her twentieth birthday, was not asyet engaged. But the various well-to-do families, belonging tohonourable clans, looked down, on the other hand, on her poor and meanextraction, holding her in such light esteem, as not to relish the ideaof making any offer for her hand. So if Fu Shih cultivated intimateterms with the Chia household, he, needless to add, did so with aninterested motive.
The two matrons, deputed on the present errand, completely lacked, as ithappened, all knowledge of the world, and the moment they heard thatPao-yue wished to see them, they wended their steps inside. But no soonerhad they inquired how he was, and passed a few remarks than YueCh'uan-erh, becoming conscious of the arrival of strangers, did notbandy words with Pao-yue, but stood with the plate of soup in her hands,engrossed in listening to the conversation. Pao-yue, again, was absorbedin speaking to the matrons; and, while eating some rice, he stretchedout his arm to get at the soup; but both his and her (Yue Ch'uan-erh's)eyes were rivetted on the women, and as he thoughtlessly jerked out hishand with some violence, he struck the bowl and turned it clean over.The soup fell over Pao-yue's hand. But it did not hurt Yue Ch'uan-erh. Shesustained, however, such a fright that she gave a start.
"How did this happen!" she smilingly shouted with vehemence to theintense consternation of the waiting-maids, who rushed up and claspedthe bowl. But notwithstanding that Pao-yue had scalded his own hand, hewas quite unconscious of the accident; so much so, that he assailed YueCh'uan-erh with a heap of questions, as to where she had been burnt, andwhether it was sore or not.
Yue Ch'uan-erh and every one present were highly amused.
"You yourself," observed Yue Ch'uan-erh, "have been scalded, and do youkeep on asking about myself?"
At these words, Pao-yue became at last aware of the injury he hadreceived. The servants rushed with all promptitude and cleared the mess.But Pao-yue was not inclined to touch any more food. He washed his hands,drank a cup of tea, and then exchanged a few further sentences with thetwo matrons. But subsequently, the two women said good-bye and quittedthe room. Ch'ing Wen and some other girls saw them as far as the bridge,after which, they retraced their steps.
The two matrons perceived, that there was no one about, and whileproceeding on their way, they started a conversation.
"It isn't strange," smiled the one, "if people say that this Pao-yue oftheirs is handsome in appearance, but stupid as far as brains go. Niceenough a thing to look at but not to put to one's lips; rather idioticin fact; for he burns his own hand, and then he asks some one elsewhether she's sore or not. Now, isn't this being a regular fool?"
"The last time I came," the other remarked, also smiling, "I heard thatmany inmates of his family feel ill-will against him. In real truth heis a fool! For there he drips in the heavy downpour like a water fowl,and instead of running to shelter himself, he reminds other people ofthe rain, and urges them to get quick out of the wet. Now, tell me,isn't this ridiculous, eh? Time and again, when no one is present, hecries to himself, then laughs to himself. When he sees a swallow, heinstantly talks to it; when he espies a fish, in the river, he forthwithspeaks to it. At the sight of stars or the moon, if he doesn't groan andsigh, he mutters and mutters. Indeed, he hasn't the least bit ofcharacter; so much so, that he even puts up with the temper shown bythose low-bred maids. If he takes a fancy to a thing, it's nice enougheven though it be a bit of thread. But as for waste, what does he mind?A thing may be worth a thousand or ten thousand pieces of money, hedoesn't worry his mind in the least about it."
While they talked, they reached the exterior of the garden, and theybetook themselves back to their home; where we will leave them.
As soon as Hsi Jen, for we will return to her, saw the women leave theroom, she took Ying Erh by the hand and led her in, and they askedPao-yue what kind of girdle he wanted made.
"I was just now so bent upon talking," Pao-yue smiled to Ying Erh, "thatI forgot all about you. I put you to the trouble of coming, not foranything else, but that you should also make me a few nets."
"Nets! To put what in?" Ying Erh inquired.
Pao-yue, at this question, put on a smile. "Don't concern yourself aboutwhat they are for!" he replied. "Just make me a few of each kind!"
Ying Erh clapped her hand and laughed. "Could this ever be done!" shecried, "If you want all that lot, why, they couldn't be finished in tenyears time."
"My dear girl," smiled Pao-yue, "work at them for me then whenever youare at leisure, and have nothing better to do."
"How could you get through them all in a little time?" Hsi Jeninterposed smilingly. "First choose now therefore such as are mosturgently needed and make a couple of them."
"What about urgently needed?" Ying-Erh exclaimed, "They are merely usedfor fans, scented pendants and handkerchiefs."
"Nets for handkerchiefs will do all right." Pao-yue answered.
"What's the colour of your handkerchief?" inquired Ying Erh.
"It's a deep red one." Pao-yue rejoined.
"For a deep red one," continued Ying Erh, "a black net will do verynicely, or one of dark green. Both these agree with the colour."
"What goes well with brown?" Pao-yue asked.
"Peach-red goes well with brown." Ying Erh added.
"That will make them look gaudy!" Pao-yue observed. "Yet with all theirplainness, they should be somewhat gaudy."
"Leek-green and willow-yellow are what are most to my taste," Ying Erhpursued.
"Yes, they'll also do!" Pao-yue retorted. "But make one of peach-red tooand then one of leek-green."
"Of what design?" Ying Erh remarked.
"How many kinds of designs are there?" Pao-yue said.
"There are 'the stick of incense,' 'stools upset towards heaven,' 'partof elephant's eyes,' 'squares,' 'chains,' 'plum blossom,' and 'willowleaves." Ying Erh answered.
"What was the kind of design you made for Miss Tertia the other day?"Pao-yue inquired.
"It was the 'plum blossom with piled cores,'" Ying Erh explained inreply.
"Yes, that's nice." Pao-yue rejoined.
As he uttered this remark, Hsi Jen arrived with the cords. But no soonerwere they brought than a matron cried, from outside the window: "Girls,your viands are ready!"
"Go and have your meal," urged Pao-yue, "and come back quick after you'vehad it."
"There are visitors here," Hsi Jen smiled, "and how can I very well go?"
"What makes you say so?" Ying Erh laughed, while adjusting the cords."It's only right and proper that you should go and have your food atonce and then return."
Hearing this, Hsi Jen and her companions went off, leaving behind onlytwo youthful servant-girls to answer the calls.
Pao-yue watched Ying Erh make the nets. But, while keeping his eyesintent on her, he talked at the same time of one thing and then another,and next went on to ask her how far she was in her teens.
Ying Erh continued plaiting. "I'm sixteen," she simultaneously rejoined.
"What was your original surname?" Pao-yue added.
"It was Huang;" answered Ying Erh.
"That's just the thing," Pao-yue smiled; "for in real truth there's the'Huang Ying-erh;' (oriole)."
"My name, at one time, consisted of two characters," continued Ying Erh."I was called Chin Ying; but Miss Pao-ch'ai didn't like it, as it wasdifficult to pronounce, and only called me Ying Erh; so now I've come tobe known under that name."
"One can very well say that cousin Pao-ch'ai is fond of you!" Pao-yuepursued. "By and bye, when she gets married, she's sure to take youalong with her."
Ying Erh puckered up her lips, and gave a significant smile.
"I've often told Hsi Jen," Pao-yue smiled, "that I can't help wonderingwho'll shortly be the lucky ones to win your mistress and yourself."
"You aren't aware," laughed Ying Erh, "that our young mistress possessesseveral qualities not to be found in a single person in this world; herface is a second consideration."
Pao-yue noticed how captivating Ying Erh's tone of voice was, howcomplaisant she was, and how simpleton-like unaffected in her languageand smiles, and he soon felt the warmest affection for her; andparticularly so, when she started the conversation about Pao-ch'ai."Where do her qualities lie?" he readily inquired. "My dear girl, pleasetell me!"
"If I tell you," said Ying Erh, "you must, on no account, let her knowanything about it again."
"This goes without saying," smiled Pao-yue.
But this answer was still on his lips, when they overheard some oneoutside remark: "How is it that everything is so quiet?"
Both gazed round to see who possibly it could be. They discovered,strange enough, no one else than Pao-ch'ai herself.
Pao-yue hastily offered her a seat. Pao-ch'ai seated herself, and thenwanted to know what Ying Erh was busy plaiting. Inquiring the while, sheapproached her and scrutinised what she held in her hands, half of whichhad by this time been done. "What's the fun of a thing like this?" shesaid. "Wouldn't it be preferable to plait a net, and put the jade init?"
This allusion suggested the idea to Pao-yue. Speedily clapping his hands,he smiled and exclaimed: "Your idea is splendid, cousin. I'd forgottenall about it! The only thing is what colour will suit it best?"
"It will never do to use mixed colours," Pao-ch'ai rejoined. "Deep redwill, on one hand, clash with the colour; while yellow is not pleasingto the eye; and black, on the other hand, is too sombre. But wait, I'lltry and devise something. Bring that gold cord and use it with the blackbeaded cord; and if you twist one of each together, and make a net withthem, it will look very pretty!"
Upon hearing this, Pao-yue was immeasurably delighted, and time aftertime he shouted to the servants to fetch the gold cord. But just at thatmoment Hsi Jen stepped in, with two bowls of eatables. "How very strangethis is to-day!" she said to Pao-yue. "Why, a few minutes back, mymistress, your mother, sent some one to bring me two bowls of viands."
"The supply," replied Pao-yue smiling, "must have been so plentifulto-day, that they've sent some to every one of you."
"It isn't that," continued Hsi Jen, "for they were distinctly given tome by name. What's more, I wasn't bidden go and knock my head; so thisis indeed remarkable!"
"If they're given to you," Pao-yue smiled, "why, you had better go andeat them. What's there in this to fill you with conjectures?"
"There's never been anything like this before," Hsi Jen added, "so, itmakes me feel uneasy."
Pao-ch'ai compressed her lips. "If this," she laughed; "makes you felluneasy, there will be by and bye other things to make you far moreuneasy."
Hsi Jen realised that she implied something by her insinuations, as sheknew from past experience that Pao-ch'ai was not one given to lightlyand contemptuously poking fun at people; and, remembering the notionsentertained by Madame Wang on the last occasion she had seen her, shedropped at once any further allusions to the subject and brought theeatables up to Pao-yue for his inspection. "I shall come and hold thecords," she observed, "as soon as I've rinsed my hands."
This said, she immediately quitted the apartment. After her meal, shewashed her hands and came inside to hold the gold cords for Ying Erh toplait the net with.
By this time, Pao-ch'ai had been called away by a servant, despatched byHsueeh P'an. But while Pao-yue was watching the net that was being made hecaught sight, at a moment least expected, of two servant-girls, who camefrom the part of Madame Hsing of the other mansion, to bring him a fewkinds of fruits, and to inquire whether he was able to walk. "If you cango about," they told him, "(our mistress) desires you, Mr. Pao-yue, tocross over to-morrow and have a little distraction. Her ladyship reallylongs to see you."
"Were I able to walk," Pao-yue answered with alacrity, "I would feel itmy duty to go and pay my respects to your mistress! Anyhow, the pain isbetter than before, so request your lady to allay her solicitude."
As he bade them both sit down, he, at the same time, called Ch'iu Wen."Take," he said to her, "half of the fruits, just received, to Miss Linas a present."
Ch'iu Wen signified her obedience, and was about to start on her errand,when she heard Tai-yue talking in the court, and Pao-yue eagerly shoutout: "Request her to walk in at once!"
But should there be any further particulars, which you, reader, mightfeel disposed to know, peruse the details given in the followingchapter.

CHAPTER XXXVI.
  While Hsi Jen is busy embroidering mandarin ducks, Pao-yue receives, in      the Chiang Yuen Pavilion, an omen from a dream.  Pao-yue apprehends that there is a destiny in affections, when his      feelings are aroused to a sense of the situation in the Pear      Fragrance court.
Ever since dowager lady Chia's return from Madame Wang's quarters, forwe will now take up the string of our narrative, she naturally felthappier in her mind as she saw that Pao-yue improved from day to day; butnervous lest Chia Cheng should again in the future send for him, shelost no time in bidding a servant summon a head-page, a constantattendant upon Chia Cheng, to come to her, and in impressing upon himvarious orders. "Should," she enjoined him, "anything turn uphenceforward connected with meeting guests, entertaining visitors andother such matters, and your master mean to send for Pao-yue, you candispense with going to deliver the message. Just you tell him that I saythat after the severe thrashing he has had, great care must be firsttaken of him during several months before he can be allowed to walk; andthat, secondly, his constellation is unpropitious and that he could notsee any outsider, while sacrifices are being offered to the stars; thatI won't have him therefore put his foot beyond the second gate beforethe expiry of the eighth moon."
The head-page listened patiently to her instructions, and, assenting toall she had to say, he took his leave.
Old lady Chia thereupon also sent for nurse Li, Hsi Jen and the otherwaiting-maids and recommended them to tell Pao-yue about her injunctionsso that he might be able to quiet his mind.
Pao-yue had always had a repugnance for entertaining high officials andmen in general, and the greatest horror of going in official hat andceremonial dress, to offer congratulations, or express condolences, topay calls, return visits, or perform other similar conventionalities,but upon receipt on the present occasion of this message, he became somuch the more confirmed in his dislikes that not only did he suspend allintercourse with every single relative and friend, but even went so faras to study more than he had ever done before, his own caprices in thefulfilment of those morning and evening salutations due to the seniormembers of his family. Day after day he spent in the garden, doingnothing else than loafing about, sitting down here, or reclining there.Of a morning, he would, as soon as it was day, stroll as far as thequarters of dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang, to repair back, however,in no time. Yet ever ready was he every day that went by to performmenial services for any of the waiting-maids. He, in fact, wasted awayin the most complete _dolce far niente_ days as well as months. Ifperchance Pao-ch'ai or any other girl of the same age as herself foundat any time an opportunity to give him advice, he would, instead oftaking it in good part, fly into a huff. "A pure and spotless maiden,"he would say, "has likewise gone and deliberately imitated thosepersons, whose aim is to fish for reputation and to seek praise; thatset of government thieves and salaried devils. This result entirelyarises from the fact that there have been people in former times, whohave uselessly stirred up trouble and purposely fabricated stories withthe primary object of enticing the filthy male creatures, who wouldspring up in future ages, to follow in their steps! And who would havethought it, I have had the misfortune of being born a masculine being!But, even those beautiful girls, in the female apartments, have been socontaminated by this practice that verily they show themselvesungrateful for the virtue of Heaven and Earth, in endowing them withperception, and in rearing them with so much comeliness."
Seeing therefore what an insane mania possessed him, not one of hiscousins came forward to tender him one proper word of counsel. LinTai-yue was the only one of them, who, from his very infancy, had neveronce admonished him to strive and make a position and attain fame, sothus it was that he entertained for Tai-yue profound consideration. Butenough of minor details.
We will now turn our attention to lady Feng. Soon after the news of ChinCh'uan-erh's death reached her, she saw that domestics from variousbranches of the family paid her frequent visits at most unexpectedhours, and presented her a lot of things, and that they courted herpresence at most unseasonable moments, to pay their compliments andadulate her, and she begun to harbour suspicions, in her own mind, asshe little knew what their object could possibly be. On this date, sheagain noticed that some of them had brought their gifts, so, whenevening arrived, and no one was present, she felt compelled to inquirejocosely of P'ing Erh what their aim could be.
"Can't your ladyship fathom even this?" P'ing Erh answered with asardonic smile. "Why, their daughters must, I fancy, be servant-girls inMadame Wang's apartments! For her ladyship's rooms four elderly girlsare at present allotted with a monthly allowance of one tael; the restsimply receiving several hundreds of cash each month; so now that ChinCh'uan-erh is dead and gone, these people must, of course, be anxious totry their tricks and get this one-tael job!"
Hearing this, lady Feng smiled a significant smile. "That's it. Yes,that's it!" she exclaimed. "You've really suggested the idea to my mind!From all appearances, these people are a most insatiable lot; for theymake quite enough in the way of money! And as for any business thatrequires a little exertion, why they are never ready to bear a share ofit! They make use of their girls as so many tools to shove their ownduties upon. Yet one overlooks that. But must they too have designs uponthis job? Never mind! These people cannot easily afford to spend upon methe money they do. But they bring this upon their own selves, so I'llkeep every bit of thing they send. I've, after all, resolved how to actin the matter!"
Having arrived at this decision, lady Feng purely and simply protractedthe delay until all the women had sent her enough to satisfy her, whenshe at last suited her own convenience and spoke to Madame Wang (on thesubject of the vacant post).
Mrs. Hsueeh and her daughter were sitting one day, at noon, in MadameWang's quarters, together with Lin Tai-yue and the other girls, when ladyFeng found an opportunity and broached the topic with Madame Wang. "Eversince," she said, "sister Chin Ch'uan-erh's death, there has been oneservant less in your ladyship's service. But you may possibly have setyour choice upon some girl; if so, do let me know who it is, so that Imay be able to pay her her monthly wages."
This reminder made Madame Wang commune with her own self. "I fancy," sheremarked; "that the custom is that there should be four or five of them;but as long as there are enough to wait upon me, I don't mind, so we canreally dispense with another."
"What you say is, properly speaking, perfectly correct," smiled ladyFeng; "but it's an old established custom. There are still a couple tobe found in other people's rooms and won't you, Madame, conform with therule? Besides, the saving of a tael is a small matter."
After this argument, Madame Wang indulged in further thought. "Nevermind," she then observed, "just you bring over this allowance and pay itto me. And there will be no need to supply another girl. I'll hand overthis tael to her younger sister, Yue Ch'uan-erh, and finish with it. Herelder sister came to an unpleasant end, after a long term of servicewith me; so if the younger sister, she leaves behind in my employ,receives a double share, it won't be any too excessive."
Lady Feng expressed her approval and turning round she said smilingly toYue Ch'uan-erh: "I congratulate you, I congratulate you!"
Yue Ch'uan-erh thereupon crossed over and prostrated herself.
"I just want to ask you," Madame Wang went on to inquire, "how much Mrs.Chao and Mrs. Chou are allowed monthly?"
"They have a fixed allowance," answered lady Feng, "each of them drawstwo taels. But Mrs. Chao gets two taels for cousin Chia Huan, so hersamounts in all to four taels; besides these, four strings of cash."
"Are they paid in full month after month?" Madame Wang inquired.
Lady Feng thought the question so very strange that she hastened toexclaim by way of reply: "How are they not paid in full?"
"The other day," Madame Wang proceeded, "I heard a faint rumour thatthere was some one, who complained in an aggrieved way that she had gota string short. How and why is this?"
"The monthly allowances of the servant-girls, attached to the secondarywives," lady Feng hurriedly added with a smile, "amounted originally toa tiao each, but ever since last year, it was decided, by those peopleoutside, that the shares of each of those ladies' girls should bereduced by half, that is, each to five hundred cash; and, as each ladyhas a couple of servant-girls, they receive therefore a tiao short. Butfor this, they can't bear me a grudge. As far as I'm concerned, I wouldonly be too glad to let them have it; but our people outside will againdisallow it; so is it likely that I can authorise any increase, pray? Inthis matter of payments I merely receive the money, and I've nothing todo with how it comes and how it goes. I nevertheless recommended, on twoor three occasions, that it would be better if these two shares wereagain raised to the old amount; but they said that there's only thatmuch money, so that I can't very well volunteer any further suggestions!Now that the funds are paid into my hands, I give them to them everymonth, without any irregularity of even so much as a day. When paymentshitherto were effected outside, what month were they not short of money?And did they ever, on any single instance, obtain their pay at theproper time and date?"
Having heard this explanation, Madame Wang kept silent for a while.Next, she proceeded to ask, how many girls there were with dowager ladyChia drawing one tael.
"Eight of them," rejoined lady Feng, "but there are at present onlyseven; the other one is Hsi Jen."
"Quite right," assented Madame Wang. "But your cousin Pao-yue hasn't anymaid at one tael; for Hsi Jen is still a servant belonging to old ladyChia's household."
"Hsi Jen," lady Feng smiled, "is still our dear ancestor's servant;she's only lent to cousin Pao-yue; so that she still receives this taelin her capacity of maid to our worthy senior. Any proposal, therefore,that might now be made, that this tael should, as Hsi Jen is Pao-yue'sservant, be curtailed, can, on no account, be entertained. Yet, were itsuggested that another servant should be added to our senior's staff,then in this way one could reduce the tael she gets. But if this be notcurtailed, it will be necessary to also add a servant in cousin ChiaHuan's rooms, in order that there should be a fair apportionment. Infact, Ch'ing Wen, She Yueeh and the others, numbering seven senior maids,receive each a tiao a month; and Chiao Hui and the rest of the juniormaids, eight in all, get each five hundred cash per mensem; and this wasrecommended by our venerable ancestor herself; so how can any one beangry and feel displeasure?"
"Just listen," laughed Mrs. Hsueeh, "to that girl Feng's mouth! Itrattles and rattles like a cart laden with walnuts, which has turnedtopsy-turvy! Yet, her accounts are, from what one can gather, clearenough, and her arguments full of reason."
"Aunt," rejoined lady Feng smiling, "was I likely, pray, wrong in what Isaid?"
"Who ever said you were wrong?" Mrs. Hsueeh smiled. "But were you to talka little slower, wouldn't it be a saving of exertion for you?"
Lady Feng was about to laugh, but hastily checking herself, she lent anear to what Madame Wang might have to tell her.
Madame Wang indulged in thought for a considerable time. Afterwards,facing lady Feng, "You'd better," she said, "select a waiting-maidtomorrow and send her over to our worthy senior to fill up Hsi Jen'splace. Then, discontinue that allowance, which Hsi Jen draws, and keepout of the sum of twenty taels, allotted to me monthly, two taels and atiao, and give them to Hsi Jen. So henceforward what Mrs. Chao and Mrs.Chou will get, Hsi Jen will likewise get, with the only difference thatthe share granted to Hsi Jen, will be entirely apportioned out of my ownallowance. Mind, therefore, there will be no necessity to touch thepublic funds!"
Lady Feng acquiesced to each one of her recommendations, and, pushingMrs. Hsueeh, "Aunt," she inquired, "have you heard her proposal? Whathave I all along maintained? Well, my words have actually come out trueto-day!"
"This should have been accomplished long ago," Mrs. Hsueeh answered. "Forwithout, of course, making any allusion to her looks, her way of doingbusiness is liberal; her speech and her relations with people are alwaysprompted by an even temper, while inwardly she has plenty of singlenessof heart and eagerness to hold her own. Indeed, such a girl is not easyto come across!"
Madame Wang made every effort to conceal her tears. "How could youpeople ever rightly estimate Hsi Jen's qualities?" she observed. "Why,she's a hundred times better than my own Pao-yue. How fortunate, inreality, Pao-yue is! Well would it be if he could have her wait upon himfor the whole length of his life!"
"In that case," lady Feng suggested, "why, have her face shaved at once,and openly place her in his room as a secondary wife. Won't this be agood plan?"
"This won't do!" Madame Wang retorted. "For first and foremost he's oftender years. In the second place, my husband won't countenance any suchthing! In the third, so long as Pao-yue sees that Hsi Jen is hiswaiting-maid, he may, in the event of anything occurring from his havingbeen allowed to run wild, listen to any good counsel she might give him.But were she now to be made his secondary wife, Hsi Jen would notventure to tender him any extreme advice, even when it's necessary to doso. It's better, therefore, to let things stand as they are for thepresent, and talk about them again, after the lapse of another two orthree years."
At the close of these arguments, lady Feng could not put in a word, byway of reply, to refute them, so turning round, she left the room. Shehad no sooner, however, got under the verandah, than she discerned thewives of a number of butlers, waiting for her to report various mattersto her. Seeing her issue out of the room, they with one consent smiled."What has your ladyship had to lay before Madame Wang," they remarked,"that you've been talking away this length of time? Didn't you find ithot work?"
Lady Feng tucked up her sleeves several times. Then resting her foot onthe step of the side door, she laughed and rejoined: "The draft in thispassage is so cool, that I'll stop, and let it play on me a bit before Igo on. You people," she proceeded to tell them, "say that I've beentalking to her all this while, but Madame Wang conjured up all that hasoccurred for the last two hundred years and questioned me about it; socould I very well not have anything to say in reply? But from this dayforth," she added with a sarcastic smile, "I shall do several meanthings, and should even (Mrs. Chao and Mrs. Chou) go, out of anyill-will, and tell Madame Wang, I won't know what fear is for suchstupid, glib-tongued, foul-mouthed creatures as they, who are bound notto see a good end! It isn't for them to indulge in those fanciful dreamsof becoming primary wives, for there, will come soon a day when thewhole lump sum of their allowance will be cut off! They grumble againstus for having now reduced the perquisites of the servant-maids, but theydon't consider whether they deserve to have so many as three girls todance attendance on them!"
While heaping abuse on their heads, she started homewards, and went allalone in search of some domestic to go and deliver a message to old ladyChia.
But without any further reference to her, we will take up the thread ofour narrative with Mrs. Hsueeh, and the others along with her. Duringthis interval they finished feasting on melons. After some more gossip,each went her own way; and Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yue and the rest of the cousinsreturned into the garden. Pao-ch'ai then asked Tai-yue to repair with herto the O Hsiang Arbour. But Tai-yue said that she was just going to haveher bath, so they parted company, and Pao-ch'ai walked back all byherself. On her way, she stepped into the I Hung Yuean, to look up Pao-yueand have a friendly hobnob with him, with the idea of dispelling hermid-day lassitude; but, contrary to her expectations, the moment she puther foot into the court, she did not so much as catch the caw of a crow.Even the two storks stood under the banana trees, plunged in sleep.Pao-ch'ai proceeded along the covered passage and entered the rooms.Here she discovered the servant-girls sleeping soundly on the bed of theouter apartment; some lying one way, some another; so turning round thedecorated screen, she wended her steps into Pao-yue's chamber. Pao-yue wasasleep in bed. Hsi Jen was seated by his side, busy plying her needle.Next to her, lay a yak tail. Pao-ch'ai advanced up to her. "You'rereally far too scrupulous," she said smilingly in an undertone. "Arethere still flies or mosquitos in here? and why do yet use that fly-flapfor, to drive what away?"
Hsi Jen was quite taken by surprise. But hastily raising her head, andrealising that it was Pao-ch'ai, she hurriedly put down her needlework."Miss," she whispered with a smile, "you came upon me so unawares thatyou gave me quite a start! You don't know, Miss, that though there be noflies or mosquitoes there is, no one would believe it, a kind of smallinsect, which penetrates through the holes of this gauze; it is scarcelyto be detected, but when one is asleep, it bites just like ants do!"
"It isn't to be wondered at," Pao-ch'ai suggested, "for the back ofthese rooms adjoins the water; the whole place is also one mass offragrant flowers, and the interior of this room is, too, full of theiraroma. These insects grow mostly in the core of flowers, so no sooner dothey scent the smell of any than they at once rush in."
Saying this, she cast a look on the needlework she (Hsi Jen) held in herhands. It consisted, in fact, of a belt of white silk, lined with red,and embroidered on the upper part with designs representing mandarinducks, disporting themselves among some lotus. The lotus flowers werered, the leaves green, the ducks of variegated colours.
"Ai-yah!" ejaculated Pao-ch'ai, "what very beautiful work! For whom isthis, that it's worth your while wasting so much labour on it?"
Hsi Jen pouted her lips towards the bed.
"Does a big strapping fellow like this," Pao-ch'ai laughed, "still wearsuch things?"
"He would never wear any before," Hsi Jen smiled, "that's why such anice one was specially worked for him, in order that when he was allowedto see it, he should not be able to do otherwise than use it. With thepresent hot weather, he goes to sleep anyhow, but as he has been coaxedto wear it, it doesn't matter if even he doesn't cover himself well atnight. You say that I bestow much labour upon this, but you haven't yetseen the one he has on!"
"It is a lucky thing," Pao-ch'ai observed, smiling, "that you're giftedwith such patience."
"I've done so much of it to-day," remarked Hsi Jen, "that my neck isquite sore from bending over it. My dear Miss," she then urged with abeaming countenance, "do sit here a little. I'll go out for a turn. I'llbe back shortly."
With these words, she sallied out of the room.
Pao-ch'ai was intent upon examining the embroidery, so in herabsentmindedness, she, with one bend of her body, settled herself on thevery same spot, which Hsi Jen had recently occupied. But she found, onsecond scrutiny, the work so really admirable, that impulsively pickingup the needle, she continued it for her. At quite an unforeseenmoment--for Lin Tai-yue had met Shih Hsiang-yuen and asked her to comealong with her and present her congratulations to Hsi Jen--these twogirls made their appearance in the court. Finding the whole placeplunged in silence, Hsiang-yuen turned round and betook herself firstinto the side-rooms in search of Hsi Jen. Lin Tai-yue, meanwhile, walkedup to the window from outside, and peeped in through the gauze frame. Ata glance, she espied Pao-yue, clad in a silvery-red coat, lyingcarelessly on the bed, and Pao-ch'ai, seated by his side, busy at someneedlework, with a fly-brush resting by her side.
As soon as Lin Tai-yue became conscious of the situation, she immediatelyslipped out of sight, and stopping her mouth with one hand, as she didnot venture to laugh aloud, she waved her other hand and beckoned toHsiang-yuen. The moment Hsiang-yuen saw the way she went on, she concludedthat she must have something new to impart to her, and she approachedher with all promptitude. At the sight, which opened itself before hereyes, she also felt inclined to laugh. Yet the sudden recollection ofthe kindness, with which Pao-ch'ai had always dealt towards her, inducedher to quickly seal her lips. And knowing well enough that Tai-yue neverspared any one with her mouth, she was seized with such fear lest sheshould jeer at them, that she immediately dragged her past the window."Come along!" she observed. "Hsi Jen, I remember, said that she would begoing at noon to wash some clothes at the pond. I presume she's therealready so let's go and join her."
Tai-yue inwardly grasped her meaning, but, after indulging in a couple ofsardonic smiles, she had no alternative but to follow in her footsteps.
Pao-ch'ai had, during this while, managed to embroider two or threepetals, when she heard Pao-yue begin to shout abusingly in his dreams."How can," he cried, "one ever believe what bonzes and Taoist priestssay? What about a match between gold and jade? My impression is thatit's to be a union between a shrub and a stone!"
Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai caught every single word uttered by him and fellunconsciously in a state of excitement. Of a sudden, however, Hsi Jenappeared on the scene. "Hasn't he yet woke up?" she inquired.
Pao-ch'ai nodded her head by way of reply.
"I just came across," Hsi Jen smiled, "Miss Lin and Miss Shih. Did theyhappen to come in?"
"I didn't see them come in," Pao-ch'ai answered. "Did they tell youanything?" she next smilingly asked of Hsi Jen.
Hsi Jen blushed and laughed significantly. "They simply came out withsome of those jokes of theirs," she explained. "What decent things couldsuch as they have had to tell me?"
"They made insinuations to-day," Pao-ch'ai laughed, "which are anythingbut a joke! I was on the point of telling you them, when you rushed awayin an awful hurry."
But no sooner had she concluded, than she perceived a servant, come overfrom lady Feng's part to fetch Hsi Jen. "It must be on account of whatthey hinted," Pao-ch'ai smilingly added.
Hsi Jen could not therefore do otherwise than arouse two servant-maidsand go. She proceeded, with Pao-ch'ai, out of the I Hung court, and thenrepaired all alone to lady Feng's on this side. It was indeed tocommunicate to her what had been decided about her, and to explain toher, as well, that though she could go and prostrate herself beforeMadame Wang, she could dispense with seeing dowager lady Chia. This newsmade Hsi Jen feel very awkward; to such an extent, that no sooner hadshe got through her visit to Madame Wang, than she returned in a hurryto her rooms.
Pao-yue had already awoke. He asked the reason why she had been calledaway, but Hsi Jen temporised by giving him an evasive answer. And onlyat night, when every one was quiet, did Hsi Jen at length give him afull account of the whole matter. Pao-yue was delighted beyond measure."I'll see now," he said, with a face beaming with smiles, "whetheryou'll go back home or not. On your return, after your last visit toyour people, you stated that your brother wished to redeem you, addingthat this place was no home for you, and that you didn't know what wouldbecome of you in the long run. You freely uttered all that languagedevoid of feeling and reason, and enough too to produce an estrangementbetween us, in order to frighten me; but I'd like to see who'llhenceforward have the audacity to come and ask you to leave!"
Hsi Jen, upon hearing this, smiled a smile full of irony. "You shouldn'tsay such things!" she replied. "From henceforward I shall be our MadameWang's servant, so that, if I choose to go I needn't even breathe a wordto you. All I'll have to do will be to tell her, and then I shall befree to do as I like."
"But supposing that I behaved improperly," demurred Pao-yue laughingly,"and that you took your leave after letting mother know, you yourselfwill be placed in no nice fix, when people get wind that you left onaccount of my having been improper."
"What no nice fix!" smiled Hsi Jen. "Is it likely that I am bound toserve even highway robbers? Well, failing anything else, I can die; forhuman beings may live a hundred years, but they're bound, in the longrun, to fall a victim to death! And when this breath shall havedeparted, and I shall have lost the sense of hearing and of seeing, allwill then be well!"
When her rejoinder fell on his ear, Pao-yue promptly stopped her mouthwith both his hands. "Enough! enough! that will do," he shouted."There's no necessity for you to utter language of this kind."
Hsi Jen was well aware that Pao-yue was gifted with such a peculiartemperament, that he even looked upon flattering or auspicious phraseswith utter aversion, treating them as meaningless and consequentlyinsincere, so when, after listening to those truths, she had spoken withsuch pathos, he, lapsed into another of his melancholy moods, she blamedherself for the want of consideration she had betrayed. Hastilytherefore putting on a smile, she tried to hit upon some suitableremarks, with which to interrupt the conversation. Her choice fell uponthose licentious and immodest topics, which had ever been a relish tothe taste of Pao-yue; and from these the conversation drifted to thesubject of womankind. But when, subsequently, reference was made to theexcellency of the weak sex, they somehow or other also came to touchupon the mortal nature of women, and Hsi Jen promptly closed her lips insilence.
Noticing however that now that the conversation had reached a point sofull of zest for him, she had nothing to say for herself, Pao-yuesmilingly remarked: "What human being is there that can escape death?But the main thing is to come to a proper end! All that those abjectmale creatures excel in is, the civil officers, to sacrifice their livesby remonstrating with the Emperor; and, the military, to leave theirbones on the battlefield. Both these deaths do confer, after life isextinct, the fame of great men upon them; but isn't it, in fact, betterfor them not to die? For as it is absolutely necessary that there shouldbe a disorderly Emperor before they can afford any admonition, to whatfuture fate do they thus expose their sovereign, if they rashly throwaway their lives, with the sole aim of reaping a fair name forthemselves? War too must supervene before they can fight; but if they goand recklessly lay down their lives, with the exclusive idea of gainingthe reputation of intrepid warriors, to what destiny will they abandontheir country by and bye? Hence it is that neither of these deaths canbe looked upon as a legitimate death."
"Loyal ministers," Hsi Jen argued, "and excellent generals simply diebecause it isn't in their power to do otherwise."
"Military officers," Pao-yue explained, "place such entire reliance uponbrute force that they become lax in their stratagems and faulty in theirplans. It's because they don't possess any inherent abilities that theylose their lives. Could one therefore, pray, say that they had no otheralternative? Civil officials, on the other hand, can still less comparewith military officers. They read a few passages from books, and committhem to memory; and, on the slightest mistake made by the Emperor,they're at once rash enough to remonstrate with him, prompted by thesole idea of attaining the fame of loyalty and devotion. But, as soon astheir stupid notions have bubbled over, they forfeit their lives, and isit likely that it doesn't lie within their power to do otherwise? Why,they should also bear in mind that the Emperor receives his decrees fromHeaven; and, that were he not a perfect man, Heaven itself would, on noaccount whatever, confer upon him a charge so extremely onerous. Thismakes it evident therefore that the whole pack and parcel of thoseofficers, who are dead and gone, have invariably fallen victims to theirendeavours to attain a high reputation, and that they had no knowledgewhatever of the import of the great principle of right! Take me as aninstance now. Were really mine the good fortune of departing life at afit time, I'd avail myself of the present when all you girls are alive,to pass away. And could I get you to shed such profuse tears for me asto swell out into a stream large enough to raise my corpse and carry itto some secluded place, whither no bird even has ever wended its flight,and could I become invisible like the wind, and nevermore from thistime, come into existence as a human being, I shall then have died at aproper season."
Hsi Jen suddenly awoke to the fact that he was beginning to give vent toa lot of twaddle, and speedily, pleading fatigue, she paid no furthernotice to him. This compelled Pao-yue to at last be quiet and go tosleep. By the morrow, all recollection of the discussion had vanishedfrom his mind.
One day, Pao-yue was feeling weary at heart, after strolling all over theplace, when remembering the song of the "Peony Pavilion," he read itover twice to himself; but still his spirits continued anything butjoyous. Having heard, however, that among the twelve girls in the PearFragrance Court there was one called Ling Kuan, who excelled in singing,he purposely issued forth by a side gate and came in search of her. Butthe moment he got there, he discovered Pao Kuan, and Yue Kuan in thecourt. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yue, they, with one consent,smiled and urged him to take a seat. Pao-yue then inquired where LingKuan was. Both girls explained that she was in her room, so Pao-yuehastened in. Here he found Ling Kuan alone, reclining against a pillow.Though perfectly conscious of his arrival, she did not move a muscle.Pao-yue ensconced himself next to her. He had always been in the habit ofplaying with the rest of the girls, so thinking that Ling Kuan was likethe others, he felt impelled to draw near her and to entreat her, with aforced smile, to get up and sing part of the "Niao Ch'ing Ssu." But hishopes were baffled; for as soon as Ling Kuan perceived him sit down, sheimpetuously raised herself and withdrew from his side. "I'm hoarse," sherejoined with a stern expression on her face. "The Empress the other daycalled us into the palace; but I couldn't sing even then."
Seeing her sit bolt upright, Pao-yue went on to pass her under a minutesurvey. He discovered that it was the girl, whom he had, some time agobeheld under the cinnamon roses, drawing the character "Ch'iang." Butseeing the reception she accorded him, who had never so far known whatit was to be treated contemptuously by any one, he blushed crimson,while muttering some abuse to himself, and felt constrained to quit theroom.
Pao Kuan and her companion could not fathom why he was so red andinquired of him the reason. Pao-yue told them. "Wait a while," Pao Kuansaid, "until Mr. Ch'iang Secundus comes; and when he asks her to sing,she is bound to sing."
Pao-yue at these words felt very sad within himself. "Where's brotherCh'iang gone to?" he asked.
"He's just gone out," Pao Kuan answered. "Of course, Ling Kuan must havewanted something or other, and he's gone to devise ways and means tobring it to her."
Pao-yue thought this remark very extraordinary. But after standing aboutfor a while, he actually saw Chia Ch'iang arrive from outside, carryinga cage, with a tiny stage inserted at the top, and a bird as well; andwend his steps, in a gleeful mood, towards the interior to join LingKuan. The moment, however, he noticed Pao-yue, he felt under thenecessity of halting.
"What kind of bird is that?" Pao-yue asked. "Can it hold a flag in itsbeak, or do any tricks?"
"It's the 'jade-crested and gold-headed bird,'" smiled Chia Ch'iang.
"How much did you give for it?" Pao-yue continued.
"A tael and eight mace," replied Chia Ch'iang.
But while replying to his inquiries, he motioned to Pao-yue to take aseat, and then went himself into Ling Kuan's apartment.
Pao-yue had, by this time, lost every wish of hearing a song. His soledesire was to find what relations existed between his cousin and LingKuan, when he perceived Chia Ch'iang walk in and laughingly say to her,"Come and see this thing."
"What's it?" Ling Kuan asked, rising.
"I've bought a bird for you to amuse yourself with," Chia Ch'iang added,"so that you mayn't daily feel dull and have nothing to distractyourself with. But I'll first play with it and let you see."
With this prelude, he took a few seeds and began to coax the bird, untilit, in point of fact, performed various tricks, on the stage, claspingin its beak a mask and a flag.
All the girls shouted out: "How nice;" with the sole exception of LingKuan, who gave a couple of apathetic smirks, and went in a huff to liedown. Again Chia Ch'iang, however, kept on forcing smiles, and inquiringof her whether she liked it or not.
"Isn't it enough," Ling Kuan observed, "that your family entraps a finelot of human beings like us and coops us up in this hole to study thisstuff and nonsense, but do you also now go and get a bird, whichlikewise is, as it happens, up to this sort of thing? You distinctlyfetch it to make fun of us, and mimick us, and do you still ask mewhether I like it or not?"
Hearing this reproach, Chia Ch'iang of a sudden sprang to his feet withalacrity and vehemently endeavoured by vowing and swearing to establishhis innocence. "How ever could I have been such a fool to-day," heproceeded, "as to go and throw away a tael or two to purchase this bird?I really did it in the hope that it would afford you amusement. I neverfor a moment entertained such thoughts as those you credit me with. Butnever mind; I'll let it go, and save you all this misery!"
So saying, he verily gave the bird its liberty; and, with one blow, hesmashed the cage to atoms.
"This bird," still argued Ling Kuan, "differs, it's true, from a humanbeing; but it too has a mother and father in its nest, and could youhave had the heart to bring it here to perform these silly pranks? Incoughing to-day, I expectorated two mouthfuls of blood, and Madame Wangsent some one here to find you so as to tell you to ask the doctor roundto minutely diagnose my complaint, and have you instead brought this tomock me with? But it so happens that I, who have not a soul to lookafter me, or to care for me, also have the fate to fall ill!"
Chia Ch'iang listened to her. "Yesterday evening," he eagerly explained,"I asked the doctor about it. He said that it was nothing at all, thatyou should take a few doses of medicine, and that he would be comingagain in a day or two to see how you were getting on. But who'd havethought it, you have again to-day expectorated blood. I'll go at onceand invite him to come round."
Speaking the while, he was about to go immediately when Ling Kuan criedout and stopped him. "Do you go off in a tantrum in this hot broilingsun?" she said. "You may ask him to come, but I won't see him."
When he heard her resolution, Chia Ch'iang had perforce to stand still.
Pao-yue, perceiving what transpired between them, fell unwittingly in adull reverie. He then at length got an insight into the deep import ofthe tracing of the character "Ch'iang." But unable to bear the ordealany longer, he forthwith took himself out of the way. So absorbed,however, was Chia Ch'iang's whole mind with Ling Kuan that he could noteven give a thought to escorting any one; and it was, in fact, the restof the singing-girls who saw (Pao-yue) out.
Pao-yue's heart was gnawed with doubts and conjectures. In an imbecileframe of mind, he came to the I Hung court. Lin Tai-yue was, at themoment, sitting with Hsi Jen, and chatting with her. As soon as Pao-yueentered his quarters, he addressed himself to Hsi Jen, with a long sigh."I was very wrong in what I said yesterday evening," he remarked. "It'sno matter of surprise that father says that I am so narrow-minded that Ilook at things through a tube and measure them with a clam-shell. Imentioned something last night about having nothing but tears, shed byall of you girls, to be buried in. But this was a mere delusion! So as Ican't get the tears of the whole lot of you, each one of you canhenceforward keep her own for herself, and have done."
Hsi Jen had flattered herself that the words he had uttered the previousevening amounted to idle talk, and she had long ago dispelled allthought of them from her mind, but when Pao-yue unawares made furtherallusion to them, she smilingly rejoined: "You are verily somewhatcracked!"
Pao-yue kept silent, and attempted to make no reply. Yet from this timehe fully apprehended that the lot of human affections is, in everyinstance, subject to predestination, and time and again he was wont tosecretly muse, with much anguish: "Who, I wonder, will shed tears forme, at my burial?"
Lin Tai-yue, for we will now allude to her, noticed Pao-yue's behaviour,but readily concluding that he must have been, somewhere or other, oncemore possessed by some malignant spirit, she did not feel it advisableto ask many questions. "I just saw," she consequently observed, "mymaternal aunt, who hearing that to-morrow is Miss Hsueeh's birthday, bademe come at my convenience to ask you whether you'll go or not, (and totell you) to send some one ahead to let them know what you mean to do."
"I didn't go the other day, when it was Mr. Chia She's birthday, so Iwon't go now." Pao-yue answered. "If it is a matter of meeting any one, Iwon't go anywhere. On a hot day like this to again don my ceremonialdress! No, I won't go. Aunt is not likely to feel displeased with me!"
"What are you driving at?" Hsi Jen speedily ventured. "She couldn't beput on the same footing as our senior master! She lives close by here.Besides she's a relative. Why, if you don't go, won't you make herimagine things? Well, if you dread the heat, just get up at an earlyhour and go over and prostrate yourself before her, and come back again,after you've had a cup of tea. Won't this look well?"
Before Pao-yue had time to say anything by way of response, Tai-yueanticipated him. "You should," she smiled, "go as far as there for thesake of her, who drives the mosquitoes away from you."
Pao-yue could not make out the drift of her insinuation. "What aboutdriving mosquitoes away?" he vehemently inquired.
Hsi Jen then explained to him how while he was fast asleep the previousday and no one was about to keep him company, Miss Pao-ch'ai had satwith him for a while.
"It shouldn't have been done!" Pao-yue promptly exclaimed, after hearingher explanations. "But how did I manage to go to sleep and show suchutter discourtesy to her? I must go to-morrow!" he then went on to add.But while these words were still on his lips, he unexpectedly caughtsight of Shih Hsian-yuen walk in in full dress, to bid them adieu, as shesaid that some one had been sent from her home to fetch her away.
The moment Pao-yue and Tai-yue heard what was the object of her visit,they quickly rose to their feet and pressed her to take a seat. But ShihHsiang-yuen would not sit down, so Pao-yue and Tai-yue were compelled toescort her as far as the front part of the mansion.
Shih Hsiang-yuen's eyes were brimming with tears; but realising thatseveral people from her home were present, she did not have the courageto give full vent to her feelings. But when shortly Pao-ch'ai ran overto find her, she felt so much the more drawn towards them, that shecould not brook to part from them. Pao-ch'ai, however, inwardlyunderstood that if her people told her aunt anything on their return,there would again be every fear of her being blown up, as soon as shegot back home, and she therefore urged her to start on her way. One andall then walked with her up to the second gate, and Pao-yue wished toaccompany her still further outside, but Shih Hsiang-yuen deterred him.Presently, they turned to go back. But once more, she called Pao-yue toher, and whispered to him in a soft tone of voice: "Should our venerablesenior not think of me do often allude to me, so that she should deputesome one to fetch me."
Pao-yue time after time assured her that he would comply with her wishes.And having followed her with their eyes, while she got into her curricleand started, they eventually retraced their steps towards the innercompound. But, reader, if you like to follow up the story, peruse thedetails contained in the chapter below.

CHAPTER XXXVII.
  In the Study of Autumnal Cheerfulness is accidentally formed the      Cydonia Japonica Society.  In the Heng Wu Court, the chrysanthemum is, on a certain night,      proposed as a subject for verses.
But to continue. After Shih Hsiang-yuen's return home, Pao-yue and theother inmates spent their time, as of old, in rambling about in thegarden in search of pleasure, and in humming poetical compositions. Butwithout further reference to their doings, let us take up our narrativewith Chia Cheng.
Ever since the visit paid to her home by the imperial consort, hefulfilled his official duties with additional zeal, for the purpose ofreverently making requital for the grace shown him by the Emperor. Hiscorrect bearing and his spotless reputation did not escape His Majesty'snotice, and he conferred upon him the special appointment of LiteraryChancellor, with the sole object of singling out his true merit; forthough he had not commenced his career through the arena of publicexaminations, he belonged nevertheless to a family addicted to lettersduring successive generations. Chia Cheng had, therefore, on the receiptof the imperial decree, to select the twentieth day of the eighth moonto set out on his journey. When the appointed day came, he worshipped atthe shrines of his ancestors, took leave of them and of dowager ladyChia, and started for his post. It would be a needless task, however, torecount with any full particulars how Pao-yue and all the inmates saw himoff, how Chia Cheng went to take up his official duties, and whatoccurred abroad, suffice it for us to notice that Pao-yue, ever sinceChia Cheng's departure, indulged his caprices, allowed his feelings torun riot, and gadded wildly about. In fact, he wasted his time, andadded fruitless days and months to his age.
On this special occasion, he experienced more than ever a sense of hislack of resources, and came to look up his grandmother Chia and MadameWang. With them, he whiled away some of his time, after which hereturned into the garden. As soon as he changed his costume, heperceived Ts'ui Mo enter, with a couple of sheets of fancy notepaper, inher hand, which she delivered to him.
"It quite slipped from my mind," Pao-yue remarked. "I meant to have goneand seen my cousin Tertia; is she better that you come?"
"Miss is all right," Ts'ui Mo answered. "She hasn't even had anymedicine to-day. It's only a slight chill."
When Pao-yue heard this reply, he unfolded the fancy notepaper. Onperusal, he found the contents to be: "Your cousin, T'an Ch'un,respectfully lays this on her cousin Secundus' study-table. When theother night the blue sky newly opened out to view, the moon shone as ifit had been washed clean! Such admiration did this pure and rarepanorama evoke in me that I could not reconcile myself to the idea ofgoing to bed. The clepsydra had already accomplished three turns, andyet I roamed by the railing under the dryandra trees. But such poortreatment did I receive from wind and dew (that I caught a chill), whichbrought about an ailment as severe (as that which prevented the man ofold from) picking up sticks. You took the trouble yesterday to come inperson and cheer me up. Time after time also did you send yourattendants round to make affectionate inquiries about me. You likewisepresented me with fresh lichees and relics of writings of Chen Ch'ing.How deep is really your gracious love! As I leant to-day on my tableplunged in silence, I suddenly remembered that the ancients ofsuccessive ages were placed in circumstances, in which they had tostruggle for reputation and to fight for gain, but that theynevertheless acquired spots with hills and dripping streams, and,inviting people to come from far and near, they did all they could todetain them, by throwing the linch-pins of their chariots into wells orby holding on to their shafts; and that they invariably joinedfriendship with two or three of the same mind as themselves, with whomthey strolled about in these grounds, either erecting altars for song,or establishing societies for scanning poetical works. Their meetingswere, it is true, prompted, on the spur of the moment, by a sudden fitof good cheer, but these have again and again proved, during many years,a pleasant topic of conversation. I, your cousin, may, I admit, bedevoid of talent, yet I have been fortunate enough to enjoy your companyamidst streams and rockeries, and to furthermore admire the elegantverses composed by Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-yue. When we were in thebreezy hall and the moonlit pavilion, what a pity we never talked aboutpoets! But near the almond tree with the sign and the peach tree by thestream, we may perhaps, when under the fumes of wine, be able to flinground the cups, used for humming verses! Who is it who opines thatsocieties with any claim to excellent abilities can only be formed bymen? May it not be that the pleasant meetings on the Tung Shan mightyield in merit to those, such as ourselves, of the weaker sex? Shouldyou not think it too much to walk on the snow, I shall make bold to askyou round, and sweep the way clean of flowers and wait for you.Respectfully written."
The perusal of this note filled Pao-yue unawares with exultation.Clapping his hands; "My third cousin," he laughed, "is the one eminentlypolished; I'll go at once to-day and talk matters over with her."
As he spoke, he started immediately, followed by Ts'ui Mo. As soon asthey reached the Hsin Fang pavilion, they espied the matron, on dutythat day at the back door of the garden, advancing towards them with anote in her hand. The moment she perceived Pao-yue she forthwith came upto meet him. "Mr. Yuen," she said, "presents his compliments to you. Heis waiting for you at the back gate. This is a note he bade me bringyou."
Upon opening the note, Pao-yue found it to read as follows: "An unfilialson, Yuen, reverently inquires about his worthy father's boundlesshappiness and precious health. Remembering the honour conferred upon meby your recognising me, in your heavenly bounty, as your son, I triedboth day as well as night to do something in evidence of my piousobedience, but no opportunity could I find to perform anything filial.When I had, some time back, to purchase flowers and plants, I succeeded,thanks to your vast influence, venerable senior, in finally makingfriends with several gardeners and in seeing a good number of gardens.As the other day I unexpectedly came across a white begonia, of a rarespecies, I exhausted every possible means to get some and managed toobtain just two pots. If you, worthy senior, regard your son as your ownvery son, do keep them to feast your eyes upon! But with this hotweather to-day, the young ladies in the garden will, I fear, not be attheir ease. I do not consequently presume to come and see you in person,so I present you this letter, written with due respect, while knockingmy head before your table. Your son, Yuen, on his knees, lays thisepistle at your feet. A joke!"
After reading this note, Pao-yue laughed. "Has he come alone?" he asked."Or has he any one else with him?"
"He's got two flower pots as well," rejoined the matron.
"You go and tell him," Pao-yue urged, "that I've informed myself of thecontents of his note, and that there are few who think of me as he does!If you also take the flowers and, put them in my room, it will be allright."
So saying, he came with Ts'ui Mo into the Ch'iu Shuang study, where hediscovered Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yue, Ying Ch'un and Hsi Ch'un alreadyassembled. When they saw him drop in upon them, they all burst outlaughing. "Here comes still another!" they exclaimed.
"I'm not a boor," smiled T'an Ch'un, "so when the idea casually crossedmy mind, I wrote a few notes to try and see who would come. But who'dhave thought that, as soon as I asked you, you would all come."
"It's unfortunately late," Pao-yue smilingly observed. "We should havestarted this society long ago."
"You can't call this late!" Tai-yue interposed, "so why give way toregret! The only thing is, you must form your society, without includingme in the number; for I daren't be one of you."
"If you daren't," Ying Ch'un smiled, "who can presume to do so?"
"This is," suggested Pao-yue, "a legitimate and great purpose; and weshould all exert our energies. You shouldn't be modest, and I yielding;but every one of us, who thinks of anything, should freely express itfor general discussion. So senior cousin Pao-ch'ai do make somesuggestion; and you junior cousin Lin Tai-yue say something."
"What are you in this hurry for?" Pao-ch'ai exclaimed. "We are not allhere yet."
This remark was barely concluded, when Li Wan also arrived. As soon asshe crossed the threshold, "It's an excellent proposal," she laughinglycried, "this of starting a poetical society. I recommend myself ascontroller. Some time ago in spring, I thought of this, 'but,' I mused,'I am unable to compose verses, so what's the use of making a mess ofthings?' This is why I dispelled the idea from my mind, and made nomention about it. But since it's your good pleasure, cousin Tertia, tostart it, I'll help you to set it on foot."
"As you've made up your minds," Tai-yue put in, "to initiate a poeticalsociety, every one of us will be poets, so we should, as a first step,do away with those various appellations of cousin and uncle and aunt,and thus avoid everything that bears a semblance of vulgarity."
"First rate," exclaimed Li Wan, "and why should we not fix upon some newdesignations by which to address ourselves? This will be a far morerefined way! As for my own, I've selected that of the 'Old farmer of TaoHsiang;' so let none of you encroach on it."
"I'll then call myself the 'resident-scholar of the Ch'iu Shuang,' andhave done," T'an Ch'un observed with a smile.
"'Resident-scholar or master' is, in fact, not to the point. It'sclumsy, besides," Pao-yue interposed. "The place here is full of dryandraand banana trees, and if one could possibly hit upon some name bearingupon the dryandra and banana, it would be preferable."
"I've got one," shouted T'an Ch'un smilingly. "I'll style myself 'theguest under the banana trees.'"
"How uncommon!" they unanimously cried. "It's a nice one!"
"You had better," laughed Tai-yue, "be quick and drag her away and stewsome slices of her flesh, for people to eat with their wine."
No one grasped her meaning, "Ch'uang-tzu," Tai-yue proceeded to explain,smiling, "says: 'The banana leaves shelter the deer,' and as she stylesherself the guest under the banana tree, is she not a deer? So be quickand make pieces of dried venison of her."
At these words, the whole company laughed.
"Don't be in a hurry!" T'an Ch'un remarked, as she laughed. "You makeuse of specious language to abuse people; but I've thought of a fine andmost apposite name for you!" Whereupon addressing herself to the party,"In days gone by," she added, "an imperial concubine, Nue Ying, sprinkledher tears on the bamboo, and they became spots, so from olden times tothe present spotted bamboos have been known as the 'Hsiang imperialconcubine bamboo.' Now she lives in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge, and has aweakness too for tears, so the bamboos over there will by and bye, Ipresume, likewise become transformed into speckled bamboos; every onetherefore must henceforward call her the 'Hsiao Hsiang imperialconcubine' and finish with it."
After listening to her, they one and all clapped their hands, and criedout: "Capital!" Lin Tai-yue however drooped her head and did not so muchas utter a single word.
"I've also," Li Wan smiled, "devised a suitable name for senior cousin,Hsueeh Pao-chai. It too is one of three characters."
"What's it?" eagerly inquired the party.
"I'll raise her to the rank of 'Princess of Heng Wu,'" Li Wan rejoined."I wonder what you all think about this."
"This title of honour," T'an Ch'un observed, "is most apposite."
"What about mine?" Pao-yue asked. "You should try and think of one for mealso!"
"Your style has long ago been decided upon," Pao-ch'ai smiled. "Itconsists of three words: 'fussing for nothing!' It's most pat!"
"You should, after all, retain your old name of 'master of the flowersin the purple cave,'" Li Wan suggested. "That will do very well."
"Those were some of the doings of my youth; why rake them up again?"Pao-yue laughed.
"Your styles are very many," T'an Ch'un observed, "and what do you wantto choose another for? All you've got to do is to make suitable replywhen we call you whatever takes our fancy."
"I must however give you a name," Pao-ch'ai remarked. "There's a veryvulgar name, but it's just the very thing for you. What is difficult toobtain in the world are riches and honours; what is not easy to combinewith them is leisure. These two blessings cannot be enjoyed together,but, as it happens, you hold one along with the other, so that we mightas well dub you the 'rich and honourable idler.'"
"It won't do; it isn't suitable," Pao-yue laughed. "It's better that youshould call me, at random, whatever you like."
"What names are to be chosen for Miss Secunda and Miss Quarta?" Li Waninquired.
"We also don't excel in versifying; what's the use consequently ofgiving us names, all for no avail?" Ying Ch'un said.
"In spite of this," argued T'an Ch'un, "it would be well to likewisefind something for you!"
"She lives in the Tzu Ling Chou, (purple caltrop Isle), so let us callher 'Ling Chou,'" Pao-ch'ai suggested. "As for that girl Quarta, shelives in the On Hsiang Hsieh, (lotus fragrance pavilion); she shouldthus be called On Hsieh and have done!"
"These will do very well!" Li Wan cried. "But as far as age goes, I amthe senior, and you should all defer to my wishes; but I feel certainthat when I've told you what they are, you will unanimously agree tothem. We are seven here to form the society, but neither I, nor MissSecunda, nor Miss Quarta can write verses; so if you will exclude usthree, we'll each share some special duties."
"Their names have already been chosen," T'an Ch'un smilingly demurred;"and do you still keep on addressing them like this? Well, in that case,won't it be as well for them to have no names? But we must also decideupon some scale of fines, for future guidance, in the event of anymistakes."
"There will be ample time to fix upon a scale of fines after the societyhas been definitely established." Li Wan replied. "There's plenty ofroom over in my place so let's hold our meetings there. I'm not, it istrue, a good hand at verses, but if you poets won't treat medisdainfully as a rustic boor, and if you will allow me to play thehostess, I may certainly also gradually become more and more refined. Asfor conceding to me the presidentship of the society, it won't beenough, of course, for me alone to preside; it will be necessary toinvite two others to serve as vice-presidents; you might then enlistLing Chou and Ou Hsieh, both of whom are cultured persons. The one tochoose the themes and assign the metre, the other to act as copyist andsupervisor. We three cannot, however, definitely say that we won't writeverses, for, if we come across any comparatively easy subject and metre,we too will indite a stanza if we feel so disposed. But you four willpositively have to do so. If you agree to this, well, we can proceedwith the society; but, if you don't fall in with my wishes, I can'tpresume to join you."
Ying Ch'un and Hsi Ch'un had a natural aversion for verses. What ismore, Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-yue were present. As soon therefore asthey heard these proposals, which harmonised so thoroughly with theirown views, they both, with one voice, approved them as excellent. T'anCh'un and the others were likewise well aware of their object, but theycould not, when they saw with what willingness they accepted the chargeinsist, with any propriety, upon their writing verses, and they feltobliged to say yes.
"Your proposals," she consequently said, "may be right enough; but in myviews they are ridiculous. For here I've had the trouble of initiatingthis idea of a society, and, instead of my having anything to say in thematter, I've been the means of making you three come and exercisecontrol over me."
"Well then," Pao-yue suggested, "let's go to the Tao Hsiang village."
"You're always in a hurry!" Li Wan remarked. "We're here to-day tosimply deliberate. So wait until I've sent for you again."
"It would be well," Pao-ch'ai interposed, "that we should also decideevery how many days we are to meet."
"If we meet too often," argued T'an Ch'un, "there won't be fun in it. Weshould simply come together two or three times in a month."
"It will be ample if we meet twice or thrice a month," Pao-ch'ai added."But when the dates have been settled neither wind nor rain shouldprevent us. Exclusive, however, of these two days, any one in highspirits and disposed to have an extra meeting can either ask us to goover to her place, or you can all come to us; either will do wellenough! But won't it be more pleasant if no hard-and-fast dates werelaid down?"
"This suggestion is excellent," they all exclaimed.
"This idea was primarily originated by me," T'an Ch'un observed, "and Ishould be the first to play the hostess, so that these good spirits ofmine shouldn't all go for nothing."
"Well, after this remark," Li Wan proceeded, "what do you say to yourbeing the first to convene a meeting to-morrow?"
"To-morrow," T'an Ch'un demurred, "is not as good as to-day; the bestthing is to have it at once! You'd better therefore choose the subjects,while Ling Chou can fix the metre, and Ou Hsieh act as supervisor."
"According to my ideas," Ying Ch'un chimed in, "we shouldn't yield tothe wishes of any single person in the choice of themes and thesettlement of the rhythm. What would really be fair and right would beto draw lots."
"When I came just now," Li Wan pursued, "I noticed them bring in twopots of white begonias, which were simply beautiful; and why should younot write some verses on them?"
"Can we write verses," Ying Ch'un retorted, "before we have as yet seenanything of the flowers?"
"They're purely and simply white begonias," Pao-chai answered, "and isthere again any need to see them before you put together your verses?Men of old merely indited poetical compositions to express their goodcheer and conceal their sentiments; had they waited to write on thingsthey had seen, why, the whole number of their works would not be inexistence at present!"
"In that case," Ying Ch'un said, "let me fix the metre."
With these words, she walked up to the book-case, and, extracting avolume, she opened it, at random, at some verses which turned out to bea heptameter stanza. Then handing it round for general perusal,everybody had to compose lines with seven words in each. Ying Ch'un nextclosed the book of verses and addressed herself to a young waiting-maid."Just utter," she bade her, "the first character that comes to yourmouth."
The waiting-maid was standing, leaning against the door, so readily shesuggested the word "door."
"The rhyme then will be the word 'door,'" Ying Ch'un smiled, "under thethirteenth character 'Yuan.' The final word of the first line istherefore 'door'."
Saying this, she asked for the box with the rhyme slips, and, pullingout the thirteenth drawer with the character "Yuan," she directed ayoung waiting-maid to take four words as they came under her hand. Thewaiting-maid complied with her directions, and picked out four slips, onwhich were written "p'en, hun, hen and hun," pot, spirit, traces anddusk.
"The two characters pot and door," observed Pao-yue, "are not very easyto rhyme with."
But Shih Shu then got ready four lots of paper and pens, share and sharealike, and one and all quietly set to work, racking their brains toperform their task, with the exception of Tai-yue, who either kept onrubbing the dryandra flowers, or looking at the autumnal weather, orbandying jokes as well with the servant-girls; while Ying Ch'un ordereda waiting-maid to light a "dream-sweet" incense stick.
This "dream-sweet" stick was, it must be explained, made only aboutthree inches long and about the thickness of a lamp-wick, in order toeasily burn down. Setting therefore her choice upon one of these as alimit of time, any one who failed to accomplish the allotted task, bythe time the stick was consumed, had to pay a penalty.
Presently, T'an Ch'un was the first to think of some verses, and, takingup her pen, she wrote them down; and, after submitting them to severalalterations, she handed them up to Ying Ch'un.
"Princess of Heng Wu," she then inquired of Pao-ch'ai, "have youfinished?"
"As for finishing, I have finished," Pao-ch'ai rejoined; "but they'reworth nothing."
Pao-yue paced up and down the verandah with his hands behind his back."Have you heard?" he thereupon said to Tai-yue, "they've all done!"
"Don't concern yourself about me!" Tai-yue returned for answer.
Pao-yue also perceived that Pao-ch'ai had already copied hers out."Dreadful!" he exclaimed. "There only remains an inch of the stick andI've only just composed four lines. The incense stick is nearly burntout," he continued, speaking to Tai-yue, "and what do you keep squattingon that damp ground like that for?"
But Tai-yue did not again worry her mind about what he said.
"Well," Pao-yue added, "I can't be looking after you! Whether good orbad, I'll write mine out too and have done."
As he spoke, he likewise drew up to the table and began putting hislines down.
"We'll now peruse the verses," Li Wan interposed, "and if by the timewe've done, you haven't as yet handed up your papers, you'll have to befined."
"Old farmer of Tao Hsiang," Pao-yue remarked, "you're not, it is true, agood hand at writing verses, but you can read well, and, what's more,you're the fairest of the lot; so you'd better adjudge the good and bad,and we'll submit to your judgment."
"Of course!" responded the party with one voice.
In due course, therefore, she first read T'an Ch'un's draft. It ran asfollows:--
  Verses on the Begonia.
  What time the sun's rays slant, and the grass waxeth cold, close the      double doors.  After a shower of rain, green moss plenteously covers the whole pot.  Beauteous is jade, but yet with thee in purity it cannot ever vie.  Thy frame, spotless as snow, from admiration easy robs me of my wits  Thy fragrant core is like unto a dot, so full of grace, so delicate!  When the moon reacheth the third watch, thy comely shade begins to      show itself.  Do not tell me that a chaste fairy like thee can take wings and pass      away.  How lovely are thy charms, when in thy company at dusk I sing my lay!
After she had read them aloud, one and all sang their praise for a time.She then took up Pao-ch'ai's, which consisted of:
  If thou would'st careful tend those fragrant lovely flowers, close of      a day the doors,  And with thine own hands take the can and sprinkle water o'er the      mossy pots.  Red, as if with cosmetic washed, are the shadows in autumn on the      steps.  Their crystal snowy bloom invites the dew on their spirits to heap      itself.  Their extreme whiteness mostly shows that they're more comely than all      other flowers.  When much they grieve, how can their jade-like form lack the traces of      tears?  Would'st thou the god of those white flowers repay? then purity      need'st thou observe.  In silence plunges their fine bloom, now that once more day yields to      dusk.
"After all," observed Li Wan, "it's the Princess of Heng Wu, whoexpresses herself to the point."
Next they bestowed their attention on the following lines, composed byPao-yue:--
  Thy form in autumn faint reflects against the double doors.  So heaps the snow in the seventh feast that it filleth thy pots.  Thy shade is spotless as Tai Chen, when from her bath she hails.  Like Hsi Tzu's, whose hand ever pressed her heart, jade-like thy soul.  When the morn-ushering breeze falls not, thy thousand blossoms grieve.  To all thy tears the evening shower addeth another trace.  Alone thou lean'st against the coloured rails as if with sense imbued.  As heavy-hearted as the fond wife, beating clothes, or her that sadly      listens to the flute, thou mark'st the fall of dusk.
When they had perused his verses, Pao-yue opined that T'an Ch'un'scarried the palm. Li Wan was, however, inclined to concede to thestanza, indited by Pao-ch'ai, the credit of possessing much merit. Butshe then went on to tell Tai-yue to look sharp.
"Have you all done?" Tai-yue asked.
So saying, she picked up a pen and completing her task, with a fewdashes, she threw it to them to look over. On perusal, Li Wan and hercompanions found her verses to run in this strain:--
  Half rolled the speckled portiere hangs, half closed the door.  Thy mould like broken ice it looks, jade-like thy pot.
This couplet over, Pao-yue took the initiative and shouted: "Capital."But he had just had time to inquire where she had recalled them to mindfrom, when they turned their mind to the succeeding lines:
  Three points of whiteness from the pear petals thou steal'st;  And from the plum bloom its spirit thou borrowest.
"Splendid!" every one (who heard) them conned over, felt impelled tocry. "It is a positive fact," they said, "that her imagination is,compared with that of others, quite unique."
But the rest of the composition was next considered. Its text was:
  The fairy in Selene's cavity donneth a plain attire.  The maiden, plunged in autumn grief, dries in her room the prints of      tears.  Winsome she blushes, in silence she's plunged, with none a word she      breathes;  But wearily she leans against the eastern breeze, though dusk has long      since fall'n.
"This stanza ranks above all!" they unanimously remarked, after it hadbeen read for their benefit.
"As regards beauty of thought and originality, this stanza certainlydeserves credit," Li Wan asserted; "but as regards pregnancy andsimplicity of language, it, after all, yields to that of Heng Wu."
"This criticism is right." T'an Ch'un put in. "That of the Hsiao Hsiangconsort must take second place."
"Yours, gentleman of I Hung," Li Wan pursued, "is the last of the lot.Do you agreeably submit to this verdict?"
"My stanza," Pao-yue ventured, "isn't really worth a straw. Yourcriticism is exceedingly fair. But," he smilingly added, "the two poems,written by Heng Wu and Hsiao Hsiang, have still to be discussed."
"You should," argued Li Wan, "fall in with my judgment; this is nobusiness of any of you, so whoever says anything more will have to pay apenalty."
Pao-yue at this reply found that he had no alternative but to drop thesubject.
"I decide that from henceforward," Li Wan proceeded, "we should holdmeetings twice every month, on the second and sixteenth. In theselection of themes and the settlement of the rhymes, you'll all havethen to do as I wish. But any person who may, during the intervals, feelso disposed, will be at perfect liberty to choose another day for anextra meeting. What will I care if there's a meeting every day of themoon? It will be no concern of mine, so long as when the second andsixteenth arrive, you do, as you're bound to, and come over to myplace."
"We should, as is but right," Pao-yue suggested, "choose some name orother for our society."
"Were an ordinary one chosen, it wouldn't be nice," T'an Ch'unexplained, "and anything too new-fangled, eccentric or strange won'talso be quite the thing! As luck would have it, we've just started withthe poems on the begonia, so let us call it the 'Begonia PoeticalSociety.' This title is, it's true, somewhat commonplace; but as it'spositively based on fact, it shouldn't matter."
After this proposal of hers, they held further consultation; andpartaking of some slight refreshments, each of them eventually retired.Some repaired to their quarters. Others went to dowager lady Chia's orMadame Wang's apartments. But we will leave them without furthercomment.
When Hsi Jen, for we will now come to her, perceived Pao-yue peruse thenote and walk off in a great flurry, along with Ts'ui Mo, she was quiteat a loss what to make of it. Subsequently, she also saw the matrons, onduty at the back gate, bring two pots of begonias. Hsi Jen inquired ofthem where they came from. The women explained to her all about them. Assoon as Hsi Jen heard their reply, she at once desired them to put theflowers in their proper places, and asked them to sit down in the lowerrooms. She then entered the house, and, weighing six mace of silver, shewrapped it up properly, and fetching besides three hundred cash, shecame over and handed both the amounts to the two matrons. "This silver,"she said, "is a present for the boys, who carried the flowers; and thesecash are for you to buy yourselves a cup of tea with."
The women rose to their feet in such high glee that their eyebrowsdilated and their eyes smiled; but, though they waxed eloquent in theexpression of their deep gratitude, they would not accept the money. Itwas only after they had perceived how obstinate Hsi Jen was in nottaking it back that they at last volunteered to keep it.
"Are there," Hsi Jen then inquired, "any servant-boys on duty outsidethe back gate?"
"There are four of them every day," answered one of the matrons."They're put there with the sole idea of attending to any orders thatmight be given them from inside. But, Miss, if you've anything to orderthem to do, we'll go and deliver your message."
"What orders can I have to give them?" Hsi Jen laughed. "Mr. Pao, ourmaster Secundus, was purposing to send some one to-day to the youngmarquis' house to take something over to Miss Shih. But you come at anopportune moment so you might, on your way out, tell the servant-boys atthe back gate to hire a carriage; and on its return you can come hereand get the money. But don't let them rush recklessly against people inthe front part of the compound!"
The matrons signified their obedience and took their leave. Hsi Jenretraced her steps into the house to fetch a tray in which to place thepresents intended for Shih Hsiang-yuen, but she discovered the shelf fortrays empty. Upon turning round, however, she caught sight of Ch'ingWen, Ch'iu Wen, She Yueeh and the other girls, seated together, busy withtheir needlework. "Where is the white cornelian tray with twistedthreads gone to?" Hsi Jen asked.
At this question, one looked at the one, and the other stared at theother, but none of them could remember anything about it. After aprotracted lapse of time, Ch'ing Wen smiled. "It was taken to MissTertia's with a present of lichees," she rejoined, "and it hasn't as yetbeen returned."
"There are plenty of articles," Hsi Jen remarked, "for sending overthings on ordinary occasions; and do you deliberately go and carry thisoff?"
"Didn't I maintain the same thing?" Ch'ing Wen retorted. "But so welldid this tray match with the fresh lichees it contained, that when Itook it over, Miss T'an Ch'un herself noticed the fact. 'How splendid,'she said, and lo, putting even the tray by, she never had it broughtover. But, look! hasn't the pair of beaded vases, which stood on thevery top of that shelf, been fetched as yet?"
"The mention of these vases," Ch'iu Wen laughed, "reminds me again of afunny incident. Whenever our Mr. Pao-yue's filial piety is aroused, heshows himself filial over and above the highest degree! The other day,he espied the olea flowers in the park, and he plucked two twigs. Hisoriginal idea was to place them in a vase for himself, but a suddenthought struck him. 'These are flowers,' he mused, 'which have newlyopened in our garden, so how can I presume to be the first to enjoythem?' And actually taking down that pair of vases, he filled them withwater with his own hands, put the flowers in, and, calling a servant tocarry them, he in person took one of the vases into dowager lady Chia's,and then took the other to Madame Wang's. But, as it happens, even hisattendants reap some benefit, when once his filial feelings are stirredup! As luck would have it, the one who carried the vases over on thatday was myself. The sight of these flowers so enchanted our venerablelady that there was nothing that she wouldn't do. 'Pao-yue,' she said toevery one she met, 'is the one, after all, who shows me much attention.So much so, that he has even thought of bringing me a twig of flowers!And yet, the others bear me a grudge on account of the love that Ilavish on him!' Our venerable mistress, you all know very well, hasnever had much to say to me. I have all along not been much of afavourite in the old lady's eyes. But on that occasion she verilydirected some one to give me several hundreds of cash. 'I was to bepitied,' she observed, 'for being born with a weak physique!' This was,indeed, an unforeseen piece of good luck! The several hundreds of cashare a mere trifle; but what's not easy to get is this sort of honour!After that, we went over into Madame Wang's. Madame Wang was, at thetime, with our lady Secunda, Mrs. Chao, and a whole lot of people;turning the boxes topsy-turvey, trying to find some coloured clothes herladyship had worn long ago in her youth, so as to give them to some oneor other. Who it was, I don't know. But the moment she saw us, she didnot even think of searching for any clothes, but got lost in admirationfor the flowers. Our lady Secunda was also standing by, and she madesport of the matter. She extolled our master Pao, for his filial pietyand for his knowledge of right and wrong; and what with what was trueand what wasn't, she came out with two cart-loads of compliments. Thesethings spoken in the presence of the whole company so added to MadameWang's lustre and sealed every one's mouth, that her ladyship was moreand more filled with gratification, and she gave me two ready-madeclothes as a present. These too are of no consequence; one way oranother, we get some every year; but nothing can come up to this sort oflucky chance!"
"Psha!" Ch'ing Wen ejaculated with a significant smile, "you are indeeda mean thing, who has seen nothing of the world! She gave the good onesto others and the refuse to you; and do you still pat on all this side?"
"No matter whether what she gave me was refuse or not," Ch'iu Wenprotested, "it's, after all, an act of bounty on the part of herladyship."
"Had it been myself," Ch'ing Wen pursued, "I would at once have refusedthem! It wouldn't have mattered if she had given me what had been leftby some one else; but we all stand on an equal footing in these rooms,and is there any one, forsooth, so much the more exalted or honorablethan the other as to justify her taking what is good and bestowing itupon her and giving me what is left? I had rather not take them! I mighthave had to give offence to Madame Wang, but I wouldn't have put up withsuch a slight!"
"To whom did she give any in these rooms?" Ch'iu Wen vehementlyinquired. "I was unwell and went home for several days, so that I am notaware to whom any were given. Dear sister, do tell me who it is so thatI may know."
"Were I to tell you," Ch'ing Wen rejoined, "is it likely that you wouldreturn them at this hour to Madame Wang?"
"What nonsense," Ch'iu Wen laughed. "Ever since I've heard about it,I've been delighted and happy. No matter if she even bestowed upon mewhat remained from anything given to a dog in these rooms, I would havebeen thankful for her ladyship's kindness. I wouldn't have worried mymind with anything else!"
After listening to her, everybody laughed. "Doesn't she know how to jeerin fine style!" they ejaculated unanimously; "for weren't they given tothat foreign spotted pug dog?"
"You lot of filthy-tongued creatures!" Hsi Jen laughed, "when you've gotnothing to do, you make me the scapegoat to crack your jokes, and pokeyour fun at! But what kind of death will, I wonder, each of you have!"
"Was it verily you, sister, who got them?" Ch'iu Wen asked with a smile."I assure you I had no idea about it! I tender you my apologies."
"You might be a little less domineering!" Hsi Jen remarked smilingly."The thing now is, who of you will go and fetch the tray."
"The vases too," Shih Yueeh suggested, "must be got back when there's anytime to spare; for there's nothing to say about our venerable mistress'quarters, but Madame Wang's apartments teem with people and many hands.The rest are all right; but Mrs. Chao and all that company will, whenthey see that the vase hails from these rooms, surely again foster evildesigns, and they won't feel happy until they've done all they can tospoil it! Besides, Madame Wang doesn't trouble herself about suchthings. So had we not as well bring it over a moment sooner?"
Hearing this, Ch'ing Wen threw down her needlework. "What you say isperfectly right," she assented, "so you'd better let me go and fetchit."
"I'll, after all, go for it." Ch'iu Wen cried. "You can go and get thattray of yours!"
"You should let me once go for something!" Ch'ing Wen pleaded. "Wheneverany lucky chance has turned up, you've invariably grabbed it; and can itbe that you won't let me have a single turn?"
"Altogether," She Yueeh said laughingly, "that girl Ch'iu Wen got a fewclothes just once; can such a lucky coincidence present itself againtoday that you too should find them engaged in searching for clothes?"
"Albeit I mayn't come across any clothes," Ch'ing Wen rejoined with asardonic smile, "our Madame Wang may notice how diligent I am, andapportion me a couple of taels out of her public expenses; there's nosaying." Continuing, "Don't you people," she laughed, "try and play yourpranks with me; for is there anything that I don't twig?"
As she spoke, she ran outside. Ch'iu Wen too left the room in hercompany; but she repaired to T'an Ch'un's quarters and fetched the tray.
Hsi Jen then got everything ready. Calling an old nurse attached to thesame place as herself, Sung by name, "Just go first and wash, comb yourhair and put on your out-of-door clothes," she said to her, "and thencome back as I want to send you at once with a present to Miss Shih."
"Miss," urged the nurse Sung, "just give me what you have; and, if youhave any message, tell it me; so that when I've tidied myself I may gostraightway."
Hsi Jen, at this proposal, brought two small twisted wire boxes; and,opening first the one in which were two kinds of fresh fruits,consisting of caltrops and "chicken head" fruit, and afterwardsuncovering the other, containing a tray with new cakes, made of chestnutpowder, and steamed in sugar, scented with the olea, "All these freshfruits are newly plucked this year from our own garden," she observed;"our Mr. Secundus sends them to Miss Shih to taste. The other day, too,she was quite taken with this cornelian tray so let her keep it for heruse. In this silk bag she'll find the work, which she asked me some timeago to do for her. (Tell her) that she mustn't despise it for itscoarseness, but make the best of it and turn it to some account. Presentrespects to her from our part and inquire after her health on behalf ofMr. Pao-yue; that will be all there's to say."
"Has Mr. Pao, I wonder, anything more for me to tell her?" the nurseSung added, "Miss, do go and inquire, so that on my return, he mayn'tagain say that I forgot."
"He was just now," Hsi Jen consequently asked Ch'iu Wen, "over there inMiss Tertia's rooms, wasn't he?"
"They were all assembled there, deliberating about starting somepoetical society or other," Ch'iu Wen explained, "and they all wroteverses too. But I fancy he's got no message to give you; so you might aswell start."
After this assurance, nurse Sung forthwith took the things, and quittedthe apartment. When she had changed her clothes and arranged her hair,Hsi Jen further enjoined them to go by the back door, where there was aservant-boy, waiting with a curricle. Nurse Sung thereupon set out onher errand. But we will leave her for the present.
In a little time Pao-yue came back. After first cursorily glancing at thebegonias for a time, he walked into his rooms, and explained to Hsi Jenall about the poetical society they had managed to establish, Hsi Jenthen told him that she had sent the nurse Sung along with some things,to Shih Hsiang-yuen. As soon as Pao-yue heard this, he clapped his hands."I forgot all about her!" he cried. "I knew very well that I hadsomething to attend to; but I couldn't remember what it was! Luckily,you've alluded to her! I was just meaning to ask her to come, for whatfun will there be in this poetical society without her?"
"Is this of any serious import?" Hsi Jen reasoned with him. "It's all,for the mere sake of recreation! She's not however able to go about ather own free will as you people do. Nor can she at home have her ownway. When you therefore let her know, it won't again rest with her,however willing she may be to avail herself of your invitation. And ifshe can't come, she will long and crave to be with you all, so isn't itbetter that you shouldn't be the means of making her unhappy?"
"Never mind!" responded Pao-yue. "I'll tell our venerable senior todespatch some one to bring her over."
But in the middle of their conversation, nurse Sung returned alreadyfrom her mission, and expressed to him, (Hsiang-yuen's) acknowledgment;and to Hsi Jen her thanks for the trouble. "She also inquired," thenurse proceeded, "what you, master Secundus, were up to, and I told herthat you had started some poetical club or other with the young ladiesand that you were engaged in writing verses. Miss Shih wondered why itwas, if you were writing verses, that you didn't even mention anythingto her; and she was extremely distressed about it."
Pao-yue, at these words, turned himself round and betook himselfimmediately into his grandmother's apartments, where he did all that layin his power to urge her to depute servants to go and fetch her.
"It's too late to-day," dowager lady Chia answered; "they'll gotomorrow, as soon as it's daylight."
Pao-yue had no other course but to accede to her wishes. He, however,retraced his steps back to his room with a heavy heart. On the morrow,at early dawn, he paid another visit to old lady Chia and broughtpressure to bear on her until she sent some one for her. Soon aftermidday, Shih Hsiang-yuen arrived. Pao-yue felt at length much relieved inhis mind. Upon meeting her, he recounted to her all that had taken placefrom beginning to end. His purpose was likewise to let her see thepoetical composition, but Li Wan and the others remonstrated. "Don't,"they said, "allow her to see them! First tell her the rhymes and numberof feet; and, as she comes late, she should, as a first step, pay apenalty by conforming to the task we had to do. Should what she writesbe good, then she can readily be admitted as a member of the society;but if not good, she should be further punished by being made to stand atreat; after which, we can decide what's to be done."
"You've forgotten to ask me round," Hsiang-yuen laughed, "and I should,after all, fine you people! But produce the metre; for though I don'texcel in versifying, I shall exert myself to do the best I can, so as toget rid of every slur. If you will admit me into the club, I shall beeven willing to sweep the floors and burn the incense."
When they all saw how full of fun she was, they felt more than everdelighted with her and they reproached themselves, for having somehow orother managed to forget her on the previous day. But they lost no timein telling her the metre of the verses.
Shih Hsiang-yuen was inwardly in ecstasies. So much so, that she couldnot wait to beat the tattoo and effect any alterations. But havingsucceeded, while conversing with her cousins, in devising a stanza inher mind, she promptly inscribed it on the first piece of paper thatcame to hand. "I have," she remarked, with a precursory smile, "stuck tothe metre and written two stanzas. Whether they be good or bad, I cannotsay; all I've kept in view was to simply comply with your wishes."
So speaking, she handed her paper to the company.
"We thought our four stanzas," they observed, "had so thoroughlyexhausted everything that could be imagined on the subject that anotherstanza was out of the question, and there you've devised a couple more!How could there be so much to say? These must be mere repetitions of ourown sentiments."
While bandying words, they perused her two stanzas. They found this tobe their burden:
No. 1.
  The fairies yesterday came down within the city gates,  And like those gems, sown in the grassy field, planted one pot.  How clear it is that the goddess of frost is fond of cold!  It is no question of a pretty girl bent upon death!  Where does the snow, which comes in gloomy weather, issue from?  The drops of rain increase the prints, left from the previous night.  How the flowers rejoice that bards are not weary of song!  But are they ever left to spend in peace a day or night?
No. 2.
  The "heng chih" covered steps lead to the creeper-laden door.  How fit to plant by the corner of walls; how fit for pots?  The flowers so relish purity that they can't find a mate.  Easy in autumn snaps the soul of sorrow-wasted man.  The tears, which from the jade-like candle drip, dry in the wind.  The crystal-like portiere asunder rends Selene's rays.  Their private feelings to the moon goddess they longed to tell,  But gone, alas! is the lustre she shed on the empty court!
Every line filled them with wonder and admiration. What they read, theypraised. "This," they exclaimed, with one consent, "is not writingverses on the begonia for no purpose! We must really start a BegoniaSociety!"
"To-morrow," Shih Hsiang-yuen proposed, "first fine me by making me standa treat, and letting me be the first to convene a meeting; may I?"
"This would be far better!" they all assented. So producing also theverses, composed the previous day, they submitted them to her forcriticism.
In the evening, Hsiang-yuen came at the invitation of Pao-ch'ai, to theHeng Wu Yuean to put up with her for the night. By lamplight, Hsiang-yuenconsulted with her how she was to play the hostess and fix upon thethemes; but, after lending a patient ear to all her proposals for a longtime, Pao-ch'ai thought them so unsuitable for the occasion, thatturning towards her, she raised objections. "If you want," she said, "tohold a meeting, you have to pay the piper. And albeit it's for mere fun,you have to make every possible provision; for while consulting your owninterests, you must guard against giving umbrage to people. In that caseevery one will afterwards be happy and contented. You count for nothingtoo in your own home; and the whole lump sum of those few tiaos, youdraw each month, are not sufficient for your own wants, and do you nowalso wish to burden yourself with this useless sort of thing? Why, ifyour aunt gets wind of it, won't she be more incensed with you thanever! What's more, even though you might fork out all the money you cancall your own to bear the outlay of this entertainment with, it won't beanything like enough, and can it possibly be, pray, that you would gohome for the express purpose of requisitioning the necessary funds? Orwill you perchance ask for some from in here?"
This long tirade had the effect of bringing the true facts of the caseto Hsiang-yuen's notice, and she began to waver in a state ofuncertainty.
"I have already fixed upon a plan in my mind," Pao-ch'ai resumed."There's an assistant in our pawnshop from whose family farm come somesplendid crabs. Some time back, he sent us a few as a present, and now,starting from our venerable senior and including the inmates of theupper quarters, most of them are quite in love with crabs. It was onlythe other day that my mother mentioned that she intended inviting ourworthy ancestor into the garden to look at the olea flowers and partakeof crabs, but she has had her hands so full that she hasn't as yet askedher round. So just you now drop the poetical meeting, and invite thewhole crowd to a show; and if we wait until they go, won't we be able toindite as many poems as we like? But let me speak to my brother and askhim to let us have several baskets of the fattest and largest crabs hecan get, and to also go to some shop and fetch several jars of lusciouswine. And if we then lay out four or five tables with plates full ofrefreshments, won't we save trouble and all have a jolly time as well?"
As soon as Hsiang-yuen heard (the alternative proposed by Pao-ch'ai,) shefelt her heart throb with gratitude and in most profuse terms shepraised her for her forethought.
"The proposal I've made." Pao-ch'ai pursued smilingly; "is promptedentirely by my sincere feelings for you; so whatever you do don't betouchy and imagine that I look down upon you; for in that case we twowill have been good friends all in vain. But if you won't give way tosuspicion, I'll be able to tell them at once to go and get thingsready."
"My dear cousin," eagerly rejoined Hsiang-yuen, a smile on her lips, "ifyou say these things it's you who treat me with suspicion; for no matterhow foolish a person I may be, as not to even know what's good and bad,I'm still a human being! Did I not regard you, cousin, in the same lightas my own very sister, I wouldn't last time have had any wish orinclination to disclose to you every bit of those troubles, whichordinarily fall to my share at home."
After listening to these assurances, Pao-ch'ai summoned a matron andbade her go out and tell her master, Hsueeh P'an, to procure a fewhampers of crabs of the same kind as those which were sent on theprevious occasion. "Our venerable senior," (she said,) "and aunt Wangare asked to come to-morrow after their meal and admire the oleaflowers, so mind, impress upon your master to please not forget, as I'vealready to-day issued the invitations."
The matron walked out of the garden and distinctly delivered themessage. But, on her return, she brought no reply.
During this while, Pao-ch'ai continued her conversation with Hsiang-yuen."The themes for the verses," she advised her, "mustn't also be tooout-of-the-way. Just search the works of old writers, and where will youfind any eccentric and peculiar subjects, or any extra difficult metre!If the subject be too much out-of-the-way and the metre too difficult,one cannot get good verses. In a word, we are a mean lot and our versesare certain, I fear, to consist of mere repetitions. Nor is it advisablefor us to aim at excessive originality. The first thing for us to do isto have our ideas clear, as our language will then not be commonplace.In fact, this sort of thing is no vital matter; spinning and needleworkare, in a word, the legitimate duties of you and me. Yet, if we can atany time afford the leisure, it's only right and proper that we shouldtake some book, that will benefit both body and mind, and read a fewchapters out of it."
Hsiang-yuen simply signified her assent. "I'm now cogitating in my mind,"she then laughingly remarked, "that as the verses we wrote yesterdaytreated of begonias, we should, I think, compose on this occasion someon chrysanthemums, eh? What do you say?"
"Chrysanthemums are in season," Pao-ch'ai replied. "The only objectionto them is that too many writers of old have made them the subject oftheir poems."
"I also think so," Hsiang-yuen added, "so that, I fear, we shall only befollowing in their footsteps."
After some reflection, Pao-ch'ai exclaimed, "I've hit upon something! Ifwe take, for the present instance, the chrysanthemums as a secondaryterm, and man as the primary, we can, after all, select several themes.But they must all consist of two characters: the one, an empty word; theother, a full one. The full word might be chrysanthemums; while for theempty one, we might employ some word in general use. In this manner, weshall, on one hand, sing the chrysanthemum; and, on the other, composeverses on the theme. And as old writers have not written much in thisstyle, it will be impossible for us to drift into the groove of theirideas. Thus in versifying on the scenery and in singing the objects, wewill, in both respects, combine originality with liberality of thought."
"This is all very well," smiled Hsiang-yuen. "The only thing is what kindof empty words will, I wonder, be best to use? Just you first think ofone and let me see."
Pao-ch'ai plunged in thought for a time, after which she laughinglyremarked: "Dream of chrysanthemums is good."
"It's positively good!" Hsiang-yuen smiled. "I've also got one: 'theChrysanthemum shadow,' will that do?"
"Well enough," Pao-ch'ai answered, "the only objection is that peoplehave written on it; yet if the themes are to be many, we might throwthis in. I've got another one too!"
"Be quick, and tell it!" Hsiang-yuen urged.
"What do you say to 'ask the Chrysanthemums?'" Pao-ch'ai observed.
Hsiang-yuen clapped her hand on the table. "Capital," she cried. "I'vethought of one also." She then quickly continued, "It is, search forchrysanthemums; what's your idea about it?"
Pao-ch'ai thought that too would do very well. "Let's choose ten of themfirst," she next proposed; "and afterwards note them down!"
While talking, they rubbed the ink and moistened the pens. Thesepreparations over, Hsiang-yuen began to write, while Pao-ch'ai enumeratedthe themes. In a short time, they got ten of them.
"Ten don't form a set," Hsiang-yuen went on to smilingly suggest, afterreading them over. "We'd better complete them by raising their number totwelve; they'll then also be on the same footing as people's picturesand books."
Hearing this proposal, Pao-ch'ai devised another couple of themes, thusbringing them to a dozen. "Well, since we've got so far," she pursued,"let's go one step further and copy them out in their proper order,putting those that are first, first; and those that come last, last."
"It would be still better like that," Hsiang-yuen acquiesced, "as we'llbe able to make up a 'chrysanthemum book.'"
"The first stanza should be: 'Longing for chrysanthemums,'" Pao-chaisaid, "and as one cannot get them by wishing, and has, in consequence,to search for them, the second should be 'searching for chrysanthemums.'After due search, one finds them, and plants them, so the third must be:'planting chrysanthemums.' After they've been planted, they, blossom,and one faces them and enjoys them, so the fourth should be 'facing thechrysanthemums.' By facing them, one derives such excessive delight thatone plucks them and brings them in and puts them in vases for one's owndelectation, so the fifth must be 'placing chrysanthemums in vases.' Ifno verses are sung in their praise, after they've been placed in vases,it's tantamount to seeing no point of beauty in chrysanthemums, so thesixth must be 'sing about chrysanthemums.' After making them the burdenof one's song, one can't help representing them in pictures. The seventhplace should therefore be conceded to 'drawing chrysanthemums.' Seeingthat in spite of all the labour bestowed on the drawing ofchrysanthemums, the fine traits there may be about them are not yet, infact, apparent, one impulsively tries to find them out by inquiries, sothe eighth should be 'asking the chrysanthemums.' As any perception,which the chrysanthemums might display in fathoming the questions setwould help to make the inquirer immoderately happy, the ninth must be'pinning the chrysanthemums in the hair.' And as after everything hasbeen accomplished, that comes within the sphere of man, there willremain still some chrysanthemums about which something could be written,two stanzas on the 'shadow of the chrysanthemums,' and the 'dream aboutchrysanthemums' must be tagged on as numbers ten and eleven. While thelast section should be 'the withering of the chrysanthemums' so as tobring to a close the sentiments expressed in the foregoing subjects. Inthis wise the fine scenery and fine doings of the third part of autumn,will both alike be included in our themes."
Hsiang-yuen signified her approval, and taking the list she copied it outclean. But after once more passing her eye over it, she went on toinquire what rhymes should be determined upon.
"I do not, as a rule, like hard-and-fast rhymes," Pao-ch'ai retorted."It's evident enough that we can have good verses without them, sowhat's the use of any rhymes to shackle us? Don't let us imitate thatmean lot of people. Let's simply choose our subject and pay no notice torhymes. Our main object is to see whether we cannot by chance hit uponsome well-written lines for the sake of fun. It isn't to make this themeans of subjecting people to perplexities."
"What you say is perfectly right," Hsiang-yuen observed. "In this mannerour poetical composition will improve one step higher. But we onlymuster five members, and there are here twelve themes. Is it likely thateach one of us will have to indite verses on all twelve?"
"That would be far too hard on the members!" Pao-ch'ai rejoined. "Butlet's copy out the themes clean, for lines with seven words will have tobe written on every one, and stick them to-morrow on the wall forgeneral perusal. Each member can write on the subject which may be mostin his or her line. Those, with any ability, may choose all twelve.While those, with none, may only limit themselves to one stanza. Bothwill do. Those, however, who will show high mental capacity, combinedwith quickness, will be held the best. But any one, who shall havecompleted all twelve themes, won't be permitted to hasten and begin overagain; we'll have to fine such a one, and finish."
"Yes, that will do," assented Hsiang-yuen. But after settling everythingsatisfactorily, they extinguished the lamp and went to bed.
Reader, do you want to know what subsequently took place? If you do,then listen to what is contained in the way of explanation in thefollowing chapter.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.
  Lin Hsiao-Hsiang carries the first prize in the poems on      chrysanthemums.  Hsueh Heng-wu chaffs Pao-yue by composing verses in the same style as      his on the crabs.
After Pao-ch'ai and Hsiang-yuen, we will now explain, settled everythingin their deliberations, nothing memorable occurred, the whole night,which deserves to be put on record.
The next day, Hsiang-yuen invited dowager lady Chia and her otherrelatives to come and look at the olea flowers. Old lady Chia and everyone else answered that as she had had the kind attention to ask them,they felt it their duty to avail themselves of her gracious invitation,much though they would be putting her to trouble and inconvenience. Attwelve o'clock, therefore, old lady Chia actually took with her MadameWang and lady Feng, as well as Mrs. Hsueeh and other members of herfamily whom she had asked to join them, and repaired into the garden.
"Which is the best spot?" old lady Chia inquired.
"We are ready to go wherever you may like, dear senior," Madame Wangventured in response.
"A collation has already been spread in the Lotus Fragrance Arbour,"lady Feng interposed. "Besides, the two olea plants, on that hill,yonder, are now lovely in their full blossom, and the water of thatstream is jade-like and pellucid, so if we sit in the pavilion in themiddle of it, won't we enjoy an open and bright view? It will berefreshing too to our eyes to watch the pool."
"Quite right!" assented dowager lady Chia at this suggestion; and whileexpressing her approbation, she ushered her train of followers into theArbour of Lotus Fragrance.
This Arbour of Lotus Fragrance had, in fact, been erected in the centreof the pool. It had windows on all four sides. On the left and on theright, stood covered passages, which spanned the stream and connectedwith the hills. At the back, figured a winding bridge.
As the party ascended the bamboo bridge, lady Feng promptly advanced andsupported dowager lady Chia. "Venerable ancestor," she said, "just walkboldly and with confident step; there's nothing to fear; it's the way ofthese bamboo bridges to go on creaking like this."
Presently, they entered the arbour. Here they saw two additional bambootables, placed beyond the balustrade. On the one, were arranged cups,chopsticks and every article necessary for drinking wine. On the other,were laid bamboo utensils for tea, a tea-service and various cups andsaucers. On the off side, two or three waiting-maids were engaged infanning the stove to boil the water for tea. On the near side werevisible several other girls, who were trying with their fans to get afire to light in the stove so as to warm the wines.
"It was a capital idea," dowager lady Chia hastily exclaimed laughinglywith vehemence, "to bring tea here. What's more, the spot and theappurtenances are alike so spick and span!"
"These things were brought by cousin Pao-ch'ai," Hsiang-yuen smilinglyexplained, "so I got them ready."
"This child is, I say, so scrupulously particular," old lady Chiaobserved, "that everything she does is thoroughly devised."
As she gave utterance to her feelings, her attention was attracted by apair of scrolls of black lacquer, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, suspendedon the pillars, and she asked Hsiang-yuen to tell her what the mottoeswere.
The text she read was:
  Snapped is the shade of the hibiscus by the fragrant oar of a boat      homeward bound.  Deep flows the perfume of the lily and the lotus underneath the bamboo      bridge.
After listening to the motto, old lady Chia raised her head and cast aglance upon the tablet; then turning round: "Long ago, when I wasyoung," she observed, addressing herself to Mrs. Hsueeh, "we likewise hadat home a pavilion like this called 'the Hall reclining on the russetclouds,' or some other such name. At that time, I was of the same age asthe girls, and my wont was to go day after day and play with my sistersthere. One day, I, unexpectedly, slipped and fell into the water, and Ihad a narrow escape from being drowned; for it was after greatdifficulty, that they managed to drag me out safe and sound. But my headwas, after all, bumped about against the wooden nails; so much so, thatthis hole of the length of a finger, which you can see up to this day onmy temple, comes from the bruises I sustained. All my people were in afunk that I'd be the worse for this ducking and continued in fear andtrembling lest I should catch a chill. 'It was dreadful, dreadful!' theyopined, but I managed, little though every one thought it, to keep insplendid health."
Lady Feng allowed no time to any one else to put in a word; butanticipating them: "Had you then not survived, who would now be enjoyingthese immense blessings!" she smiled. "This makes it evident that nosmall amount of happiness and long life were in store for you, venerableancestor, from your very youth up! It was by the agency of the spiritsthat this hole was knocked open so that they might fill it up withhappiness and longevity! The old man Shou Hsing had, in fact, a hole inhis head, which was so full of every kind of blessing conducive tohappiness and long life that it bulged up ever so high!"
Before, however, she could conclude, dowager lady Chia and the rest wereconvulsed with such laughter that their bodies doubled in two.
"This monkey is given to dreadful tricks!" laughed old lady Chia. "She'salways ready to make a scapegoat of me to evoke amusement. But wouldthat I could take that glib mouth of yours and rend it in pieces."
"It's because I feared that the cold might, when you by and bye havesome crabs to eat, accumulate in your intestines," lady Feng pleaded,"that I tried to induce you, dear senior, to have a laugh, so as to makeyou gay and merry. For one can, when in high spirits, indulge in acouple of them more with impunity."
"By and bye," smiled old lady Chia, "I'll make you follow me day andnight, so that I may constantly be amused and feel my mind diverted; Iwon't let you go back to your home."
"It's that weakness of yours for her, venerable senior," Madame Wangobserved with a smile, "that has got her into the way of behaving inthis manner, and, if you go on speaking to her as you do, she'll soonbecome ever so much the more unreasonable."
"I like her such as she is," dowager lady Chia laughed. "Besides, she'struly no child, ignorant of the distinction between high and low. Whenwe are at home, with no strangers present, we ladies should be on termslike these, and as long, in fact, as we don't overstep propriety, it'sall right. If not, what would he the earthly use of making them behavelike so many saints?"
While bandying words, they entered the pavilion in a body. After tea,lady Feng hastened to lay out the cups and chopsticks. At the uppertable then seated herself old lady Chia, Mrs. Hsueeh, Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yueand Pao-yue. Round the table, on the east, sat Shih Hsiang-yuen, MadameWang, Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un and Hsi Ch'un. At the small table, leaningagainst the door on the west side, Li Wan and lady Feng assignedthemselves places. But it was for the mere sake of appearances, asneither of them ventured to sit down, but remained in attendance at thetwo tables, occupied by old lady Chia and Madame Wang.
"You'd better," lady Feng said, "not bring in too many crabs at a time.Throw these again into the steaming-basket! Only serve ten; and whenthey're eaten, a fresh supply can be fetched!"
Asking, at the same time, for water, she washed her hands, and, takingher position near dowager lady Chia, she scooped out the meat from acrab, and offered the first help to Mrs. Hsueeh.
"They'll be sweeter were I to open them with my own hands," Mrs. Hsueehremarked, "there's no need for any one to serve me."
Lady Feng, therefore, presented it to old lady Chia and handed a secondportion to Pao-yue.
"Make the wine as warm as possible and bring it in!" she then went on tocry. "Go," she added, directing the servant-girls, "and fetch thepowder, made of green beans, and scented with the leaves ofchrysanthemums and the stamens of the olea fragrans; and keep it readyto rinse our hands with."
Shih Hsiang-yuen had a crab to bear the others company, but no sooner hadshe done than she retired to a lower seat, from where she helped herguests. When she, however, walked out a second time to give orders tofill two dishes and send them over to Mrs. Chao, she perceived lady Fengcome up to her again. "You're not accustomed to entertaining," she said,"so go and have your share to eat. I'll attend to the people for youfirst, and, when they've gone, I'll have all I want."
Hsiang-yuen would not agree to her proposal. But giving furtherdirections to the servants to spread two tables under the verandah onthe off-side, she pressed Yuean Yang, Hu Po, Ts'ai Hsia, Ts'ai Yuen andP'ing Erh to go and seat themselves.
"Lady Secunda," consequently ventured Yuean Yang, "you're in here doingthe honours, so may I go and have something to eat?"
"You can all go," replied lady Feng; "leave everything in my charge, andit will be all right."
While these words were being spoken, Shih Hsiang-yuen resumed her placeat the banquet. Lady Feng and Li Wan then took hurry-scurry something toeat as a matter of form; but lady Feng came down once more to look afterthings. After a time, she stepped out on the verandah where Yuean Yangand the other girls were having their refreshments in high glee. As soonas they caught sight of her, Yuan Yang and her companions stood up."What has your ladyship come out again for?" they inquired. "Do let usalso enjoy a little peace and quiet!"
"This chit Yuean Yang is worse than ever!" lady Feng laughed. "Here I'mslaving away for you, and, instead of feeling grateful to me, you bearme a grudge! But don't you yet quick pour me a cup of wine?"
Yuean Yang immediately smiled, and filling a cup, she applied it to ladyFeng's lips. Lady Feng stretched out her neck and emptied it. But Hu Poand Ts'ai Hsia thereupon likewise replenished a cup and put it to ladyFeng's mouth. Lady Feng swallowed the contents of that as well. P'ingErh had, by this time, brought her some yellow meat which she had pickedout from the shell. "Pour plenty of ginger and vinegar!" shouted ladyFeng, and, in a moment, she made short work of that too. "You people,"she smiled, "had better sit down and have something to eat, for I'm offnow."
"You brazen-faced thing," exclaimed Yuean Yang laughingly, "to eat whatwas intended for us!"
"Don't be so captious with me!" smiled lady Feng. "Are you aware thatyour master Secundus, Mr. Lien, has taken such a violent fancy to youthat he means to speak to our old lady to let you be his secondarywife!"
Yuean Yang blushed crimson. "Ts'ui!" she shouted. "Are these really wordsto issue from the mouth of a lady! But if I don't daub your face allover with my filthy hands, I won't feel happy!"
Saying this, she rushed up to her. She was about to besmear her face,when lady Feng pleaded: "My dear child, do let me off this time!"
"Lo, that girl Yuean," laughed Hu Po, "wishes to smear her, and thathussey P'ing still spares her! Look here, she has scarcely had twocrabs, and she has drunk a whole saucerful of vinegar!"
P'ing Erh was holding a crab full of yellow meat, which she was in theact of cleaning. As soon therefore as she heard this taunt, she came,crab in hand, to spatter Hu Po's face, as she laughingly reviled her."I'll take you minx with that cajoling tongue of yours" she cried,"and...."
But, Hu Po, while also indulging in laughter, drew aside; so P'ing Erhbeat the air, and fell forward, daubing, by a strange coincidence, thecheek of lady Feng. Lady Feng was at the moment having a littlegood-humoured raillery with Yuean Yang, and was taken so much off herguard, that she was quite startled out of her senses. "Ai-yah!" sheejaculated. The bystanders found it difficult to keep their countenance,and, with one voice, they exploded into a boisterous fit of laughter.Lady Feng as well could not help feeling amused, and smilingly sheupbraided her. "You stupid wench!" she said; "Have you by gorging lostyour eyesight that you recklessly smudge your mistress' face?"
P'ing Erh hastily crossed over and wiped her face for her, and then wentin person to fetch some water.
"O-mi-to-fu," ejaculated Yuean Yang, "this is a distinct retribution!"
Dowager lady Chia, though seated on the other side, overheard theirshouts, and she consecutively made inquiries as to what they had seen totickled their fancy so. "Tell us," (she urged), "what it is so that wetoo should have a laugh."
"Our lady Secunda," Yuean Yang and the other maids forthwith laughinglycried, "came to steal our crabs and eat them, and P'ing Erh got angryand daubed her mistress' face all over with yellow meat. So our mistressand that slave-girl are now having a scuffle over it."
This report filled dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the other inmateswith them with much merriment. "Do have pity on her," dowager lady Chialaughed, "and let her have some of those small legs and entrails to eat,and have done!"
Yuan Yang and her companions assented, much amused. "Mistress Secunda,"they shouted in a loud tone of voice, "you're at liberty to eat thiswhole tableful of legs!"
But having washed her face clean, lady Feng approached old lady Chia andthe other guests and waited upon them for a time, while they partook ofrefreshments.
Tai-yue did not, with her weak physique, venture to overload her stomach,so partaking of a little meat from the claws, she left the table.Presently, however, dowager lady Chia too abandoned all idea of havinganything more to eat. The company therefore quitted the banquet; and,when they had rinsed their hands, some admired the flowers, some playedwith the water, others looked at the fish.
After a short stroll, Madame Wang turned round and remarked to old ladyChia: "There's plenty of wind here. Besides, you've just had crabs; soit would be prudent for you, venerable senior, to return home and rest.And if you feel in the humour, we can come again for a turn to-morrow."
"Quite true!" acquiesced dowager lady Chia, in reply to this suggestion."I was afraid that if I left, now that you're all in exuberant spirits,I mightn't again be spoiling your fun, (so I didn't budge). But as theidea originates from yourselves do go as you please, (while I retire).But," she said to Hsiang-yuen, "don't allow your cousin Secundus, Pao-yue,and your cousin Lin to have too much to eat." Then when Hsiang-yuen hadsignified her obedience, "You two girls," continuing, she recommendedHsiang-yuen and Pao-ch'ai, "must not also have more than is good for you.Those things are, it's true, luscious, but they're not very wholesome;and if you eat immoderately of them, why, you'll get stomachaches."
Both girls promised with alacrity to be careful; and, having escortedher beyond the confines of the garden, they retraced their steps andordered the servants to clear the remnants of the banquet and to lay outa new supply of refreshments.
"There's no use of any regular spread out!" Pao-yue interposed. "When youare about to write verses, that big round table can be put in the centreand the wines and eatables laid on it. Neither will there be any need toceremoniously have any fixed seats. Let those who may want anything toeat, go up to it and take what they like; and if we seat ourselves,scattered all over the place, won't it be far more convenient for us?"
"Your idea is excellent!" Pao-ch'ai answered.
"This is all very well," Hsiang-yuen observed, "but there are others tobe studied besides ourselves!"
Issuing consequently further directions for another table to be laid,and picking out some hot crabs, she asked Hsi Jen, Tzu Chuean, Ssu Ch'i,Shih Shu, Ju Hua, Ying Erh, Ts'ui Mo and the other girls to sit togetherand form a party. Then having a couple of flowered rugs spread under theolea trees on the hills, she bade the matrons on duty, the waiting-maidsand other servants to likewise make themselves comfortable and to eatand drink at their pleasure until they were wanted, when they could comeand answer the calls.
Hsiang-yuen next fetched the themes for the verses and pinned them with aneedle on the wall. "They're full of originality," one and all exclaimedafter perusal, "we fear we couldn't write anything on them."
Hsiang-yuen then went onto explain to them the reasons that had promptedher not to determine upon any particular rhymes.
"Yes, quite right!" put in Pao-yue. "I myself don't fancy hard and fastrhymes!"
But Lin Tai-yue, being unable to stand much wine and to take any crabs,told, on her own account, a servant to fetch an embroidered cushion;and, seating herself in such a way as to lean against the railing, shetook up a fishing-rod and began to fish. Pao-ch'ai played for a timewith a twig of olea she held in her hand, then resting on thewindow-sill, she plucked the petals, and threw them into the water,attracting the fish, which went by, to rise to the surface and nibble atthem. Hsiang-yuen, after a few moments of abstraction, urged Hsi Jen andthe other girls to help themselves to anything they wanted, and beckonedto the servants, seated at the foot of the hill, to eat to their heart'scontent. Tan Ch'un, in company with Li Wan and Hsi Ch'un, stoodmeanwhile under the shade of the weeping willows, and looked at thewidgeons and egrets. Ying Ch'un, on the other hand, was all alone underthe shade of some trees, threading double jasmine flowers, with a needlespecially adapted for the purpose. Pao-yue too watched Tai-yue fishing fora while. At one time he leant next to Pao-ch'ai and cracked a few jokeswith her. And at another, he drank, when he noticed Hsi Jen feasting oncrabs with her companions, a few mouthfuls of wine to keep her company.At this, Hsi Jen cleaned the meat out of a shell, and gave it to him toeat.
Tai-yue then put down the fishing-rod, and, approaching the seats, shelaid hold of a small black tankard, ornamented with silver plum flowers,and selected a tiny cup, made of transparent stone, red like a begonia,and in the shape of a banana leaf. A servant-girl observed hermovements, and, concluding that she felt inclined to have a drink, shedrew near with hurried step to pour some wine for her.
"You girls had better go on eating," Tai-yue remonstrated, "and let mehelp myself; there'll be some fun in it then!"
So speaking, she filled for herself a cup half full; but discoveringthat it was yellow wine, "I've eaten only a little bit of crab," shesaid, "and yet I feel my mouth slightly sore; so what would do for menow is a mouthful of very hot distilled spirit."
Pao-yue hastened to take up her remark. "There's some distilled spirit,"he chimed in. "Take some of that wine," he there and then shouted out toa servant, "scented with acacia flowers, and warm a tankard of it."
When however it was brought Tai-yue simply took a sip and put it downagain.
Pao-ch'ai too then came forward, and picked up a double cup; but, afterdrinking a mouthful of it, she lay it aside, and, moistening her pen,she walked up to the wall, and marked off the first theme: "longing forchrysanthemums," below which she appended a character "Heng."
"My dear cousin," promptly remarked Pao-yue. "I've already got four linesof the second theme so let me write on it!"
"I managed, after ever so much difficulty, to put a stanza together,"Pao-ch'ai smiled, "and are you now in such a hurry to deprive me of it?"
Without so much as a word, Tai-yue took a pen and put a distinctive signopposite the eighth, consisting of: "ask the chrysanthemums;" and,singling out, in quick succession, the eleventh: "dream ofchrysanthemums," as well, she too affixed for herself the word "Hsiao"below. But Pao-yue likewise got a pen, and marked his choice, the twelfthon the list: "seek for chrysanthemums," by the side of which he wrotethe character "Chiang."
T'an Ch'un thereupon rose to her feet. "If there's no one to write on'Pinning the chrysanthemums'" she observed, while scrutinising thethemes, "do let me have it! It has just been ruled," she continued,pointing at Pao-yue with a significant smile, "that it is on no accountpermissible to introduce any expressions, bearing reference to the innerchambers, so you'd better be on your guard!"
But as she spoke, she perceived Hsiang-yuen come forward, and jointlymark the fourth and fifth, that is: "facing the chrysanthemums," and"putting chrysanthemums in vases," to which she, like the others,appended a word, Hsiang."
"You too should get a style or other!" T'an Ch'un suggested.
"In our home," smiled Hsiang-yuen, "there exist, it is true, at presentseveral halls and structures, but as I don't live in either, there'll beno fun in it were I to borrow the name of any one of them!"
"Our venerable senior just said," Pao-ch'ai observed laughingly, "thatthere was also in your home a water-pavilion called 'leaning on russetclouds hall,' and is it likely that it wasn't yours? But albeit itdoesn't exist now-a-days, you were anyhow its mistress of old."
"She's right!" one and all exclaimed.
Pao-yue therefore allowed Hsiang-yuen no time to make a move, butforthwith rubbed off the character "Hsiang," for her and substitutedthat of "Hsia" (russet).
A short time only elapsed before the compositions on the twelve themeshad all been completed. After they had each copied out their respectiveverses, they handed them to Ying Ch'un, who took a separate sheet ofsnow-white fancy paper, and transcribed them together, affixingdistinctly under each stanza the style of the composer. Li Wan and herassistants then began to read, starting from the first on the list, theverses which follow:
"Longing for chrysanthemums," by the "Princess of Heng Wu."
  With anguish sore I face the western breeze, and wrapt in grief, I      pine for you!  What time the smart weed russet turns, and the reeds white, my heart      is rent in two.  When in autumn the hedges thin, and gardens waste, all trace of you is      gone.  When the moon waxeth cold, and the dew pure, my dreams then know      something of you.  With constant yearnings my heart follows you as far as wild geese      homeward fly.  Lonesome I sit and lend an ear, till a late hour to the sound of the      block!  For you, ye yellow flowers, I've grown haggard and worn, but who doth      pity me,  And breathe one word of cheer that in the ninth moon I will soon meet      you again?
"Search for chrysanthemums," by the "Gentleman of I Hung:"
  When I have naught to do, I'll seize the first fine day to try and      stroll about.  Neither wine-cups nor cups of medicine will then deter me from my      wish.  Who plants the flowers in all those spots, facing the dew and under      the moon's rays?  Outside the rails they grow and by the hedge; but in autumn where do      they go?  With sandals waxed I come from distant shores; my feelings all      exuberant;  But as on this cold day I can't exhaust my song, my spirits get      depressed.  The yellow flowers, if they but knew how comfort to a poet to afford,  Would not let me this early morn trudge out in vain with my cash-laden      staff.
"Planting chrysanthemums," by the Gentleman of "I Hung:"
  When autumn breaks, I take my hoe, and moving them myself out of the      park,  I plant them everywhere near the hedges and in the foreground of the      halls.  Last night, when least expected, they got a good shower, which made      them all revive.  This morn my spirits still rise high, as the buds burst in bloom      bedecked with frost.  Now that it's cool, a thousand stanzas on the autumn scenery I sing.  In ecstasies from drink, I toast their blossom in a cup of cold, and      fragrant wine.  With spring water. I sprinkle them, cover the roots with mould and      well tend them,  So that they may, like the path near the well, be free of every grain      of dirt.
"Facing the chrysanthemums," by the "Old friend of the Hall reclining onthe russet clouds."
  From other gardens I transplant them, and I treasure them like gold.  One cluster bears light-coloured bloom; another bears dark shades.  I sit with head uncovered by the sparse-leaved artemesia hedge,  And in their pure and cool fragrance, clasping my knees, I hum my      lays.  In the whole world, methinks, none see the light as peerless as these      flowers.  From all I see you have no other friend more intimate than me.  Such autumn splendour, I must not misuse, as steadily it fleets.  My gaze I fix on you as I am fain each moment to enjoy!
"Putting chrysanthemums in vases," by the "Old Friend of the hallreclining on the russet clouds."
  The lute I thrum, and quaff my wine, joyful at heart that ye are meet      to be my mates.  The various tables, on which ye are laid, adorn with beauteous grace      this quiet nook.  The fragrant dew, next to the spot I sit, is far apart from that by      the three paths.  I fling my book aside and turn my gaze upon a twig full of your autumn      (bloom).  What time the frost is pure, a new dream steals o'er me, as by the      paper screen I rest.  When cold holdeth the park, and the sun's rays do slant, I long and      yearn for you, old friends.  I too differ from others in this world, for my own tastes resemble      those of yours.  The vernal winds do not hinder the peach tree and the pear from      bursting forth in bloom.
"Singing chrysanthemums," by the "Hsiao Hsiang consort."
  Eating the bread of idleness, the frenzy of poetry creeps over me both      night and day.  Round past the hedge I wend, and, leaning on the rock, I intone verses      gently to myself.  From the point of my pencil emanate lines of recondite grace, so near      the frost I write.  Some scent I hold by the side of my mouth, and, turning to the moon, I      sing my sentiments.  With self-pitying lines pages I fill, so as utterance to give to all      my cares and woes.  From these few scanty words, who could fathom the secrets of my heart      about the autumntide?  Beginning from the time when T'ao, the magistrate, did criticise the      beauty of your bloom,  Yea, from that date remote up to this very day, your high renown has      ever been extolled.
"Drawing chrysanthemums," by the "Princess of Heng Wu."
  Verses I've had enough, so with my pens I play; with no idea that I am      mad.  Do I make use of pigments red or green as to involve a task of      toilsome work?  To form clusters of leaves, I sprinkle simply here and there a      thousand specks of ink.  And when I've drawn the semblance of the flowers, some spots I make to      represent the frost.  The light and dark so life-like harmonise with the figure of those      there in the wind,  That when I've done tracing their autumn growth, a fragrant smell      issues under my wrist.  Do you not mark how they resemble those, by the east hedge, which you      leisurely pluck?  Upon the screens their image I affix to solace me for those of the      ninth moon.
"Asking the chrysanthemums," by the "Hsiao Hsiang consort."
  Your heart, in autumn, I would like to read, but know it no one could!  While humming with my arms behind my back, on the east hedge I rap.  So peerless and unique are ye that who is meet with you to stay?  Why are you of all flowers the only ones to burst the last in bloom?  Why in such silence plunge the garden dew and the frost in the hall?  When wild geese homeward fly and crickets sicken, do you think of me?  Do not tell me that in the world none of you grow with power of      speech?  But if ye fathom what I say, why not converse with me a while?
"Pinning the chrysanthemums in the hair," by the "Visitor under thebanana trees."
  I put some in a vase, and plant some by the hedge, so day by day I      have ample to do.  I pluck them, yet don't fancy they are meant for girls to pin before      the glass in their coiffure.  My mania for these flowers is just as keen as was that of the squire,      who once lived in Ch'ang An.  I rave as much for them as raved Mr. P'eng Tse, when he was under the      effects of wine.  Cold is the short hair on his temples and moistened with dew, which on      it dripped from the three paths.  His flaxen turban is suffused with the sweet fragrance of the autumn      frost in the ninth moon.  That strong weakness of mine to pin them in my hair is viewed with      sneers by my contemporaries.  They clap their hands, but they are free to laugh at me by the      roadside as much us e'er they list.
"The shadow of the chrysanthemums," by the "Old Friend of the hallreclining on the russet clouds."
  In layers upon layers their autumn splendour grows and e'er thick and      thicker.  I make off furtively, and stealthily transplant them from the three      crossways.  The distant lamp, inside the window-frame, depicts their shade both      far and near.  The hedge riddles the moon's rays, like unto a sieve, but the flowers      stop the holes.  As their reflection cold and fragrant tarries here, their soul must      too abide.  The dew-dry spot beneath the flowers is so like them that what is said      of dreams is trash.  Their precious shadows, full of subtle scent, are trodden down to      pieces here and there.  Could any one with eyes half closed from drinking, not mistake the      shadow for the flowers.
"Dreaming of chrysanthemums," by the "Hsiao Hsiang consort."
  What vivid dreams arise as I dose by the hedge amidst those autumn      scenes!  Whether clouds bear me company or the moon be my mate, I can't      discern.  In fairyland I soar, not that I would become a butterfly like Chang.  So long I for my old friend T'ao, the magistrate, that I again seek      him.  In a sound sleep I fell; but so soon as the wild geese cried, they      broke my rest.  The chirp of the cicadas gave me such a start that I bear them a      grudge.  My secret wrongs to whom can I go and divulge, when I wake up from      sleep?  The faded flowers and the cold mist make my feelings of anguish know      no bounds.
"Fading of the chrysanthemums," by the "Visitor under the banana trees."
  The dew congeals; the frost waxes in weight; and gradually dwindles      their bloom.  After the feast, with the flower show, follows the season of the      'little snow.'  The stalks retain still some redundant smell, but the flowers' golden      tinge is faint.  The stems do not bear sign of even one whole leaf; their verdure is      all past.  Naught but the chirp of crickets strikes my ear, while the moon shines      on half my bed.  Near the cold clouds, distant a thousand li, a flock of wild geese      slowly fly.  When autumn breaks again next year, I feel certain that we will meet      once more.  We part, but only for a time, so don't let us indulge in anxious      thoughts.
Each stanza they read they praised; and they heaped upon each otherincessant eulogiums.
"Let me now criticise them; I'll do so with all fairness!" Li Wansmiled. "As I glance over the page," she said, "I find that each of youhas some distinct admirable sentiments; but in order to be impartial inmy criticism to-day, I must concede the first place to: 'Singing thechrysanthemums;' the second to: 'Asking the chrysanthemums;' and thethird to: 'Dreaming of chrysanthemums.' The original nature of thethemes makes the verses full of originality, and their conception stillmore original. But we must allow to the 'Hsiao Hsiang consort' thecredit of being the best; next in order following: 'Pinningchrysanthemums in the hair,' 'Facing the chrysanthemums,' 'Putting thechrysanthemums, in vases,' 'Drawing the chrysanthemums,' and 'Longingfor chrysanthemums,' as second best."
This decision filled Pao-yue with intense gratification. Clapping hishands, "Quite right! it's most just," he shouted.
"My verses are worth nothing!" Tai-yue remarked. "Their fault, after all,is that they are a little too minutely subtile."
"They are subtile but good," Li Wan rejoined; "for there's noartificialness or stiffness about them."
"According to my views," Tai-yue observed, "the best line is:
 "'When cold holdeth the park and the sun's rays do slant, I long and      yearn for you, old friends.'
"The metonomy:
 "'I fling my book aside and turn my gaze upon a twig of autumn.'
is already admirable! She has dealt so exhaustively with 'puttingchrysanthemums in a vase' that she has left nothing unsaid that could besaid, and has had in consequence to turn her thought back and considerthe time anterior to their being plucked and placed in vases. Hersentiments are profound!"
"What you say is certainly so," explained Li Wan smiling; "but that lineof yours:
 "'Some scent I hold by the side of my mouth,....'
"beats that."
"After all," said T'an Ch'un, "we must admit that there's depth ofthought in those of the 'Princess of Heng Wu' with:
 "'...in autumn all trace of you is gone;'
"and
 "'...my dreams then know something of you!'
"They really make the meaning implied by the words 'long for' stand outclearly."
"Those passages of yours:
 "'Cold is the short hair on his temples and moistened....'
"and
 "'His flaxen turban is suffused with the sweet fragrance....;'"
laughingly observed Puo-ch'ai, "likewise bring out the idea of 'pinningthe chrysanthemums in the hair' so thoroughly that one couldn't get aloop hole for fault-finding."
Hsiang-yuen then smiled.
  "'...who is meet with you to stay'"
she said, "and
 "'...burst the last in bloom.'
"are questions so straight to the point set to the chrysanthemums, thatthey are quite at a loss what answer to give."
"Were what you say:
 "'I sit with head uncovered....'
"and
 "'...clasping my knees, I hum my lays....'
"as if you couldn't, in fact, tear yourself away for even a moment fromthem," Li Wan laughed, "to come to the knowledge of the chrysanthemums,why, they would certainly be sick and tired of you."
This joke made every one laugh.
"I'm last again!" smiled Pao-yue. "Is it likely that:
 "'Who plants the flowers?....  ...in autumn where do they go?  With sandals waxed I come from distant shores;....  ...and as on this cold day I can't exhaust my song;....'
"do not all forsooth amount to searching for chrysanthemums? And that
 "'Last night they got a shower....  And this morn ... bedecked with frost,'
"don't both bear on planting them? But unfortunately they can't come upto these lines:
 "'Some scent I hold by the side of my mouth and turning to the moon I      sing my sentiments.'  'In their pure and cool fragrance, clasping my knees I hum my lays.'  '...short hair on his temples....'  'His flaxen turban....  ...golden tinge is faint.  ...verdure is all past.  ...in autumn ... all trace of you is gone.  ...my dreams then know something of you.'
"But to-morrow," he proceeded, "if I have got nothing to do, I'll writetwelve stanzas my self."
"Yours are also good," Li Wan pursued, "the only thing is that theyaren't as full of original conception as those other lines, that's all."
But after a few further criticisms, they asked for some more warm crabs;and, helping themselves, as soon as they were brought, from the largecircular table, they regaled themselves for a time.
"With the crabs to-day in one's hand and the olea before one's eyes, onecannot help inditing verses," Pao-yue smiled. "I've already thought of afew; but will any of you again have the pluck to devise any?"
With this challenge, he there and then hastily washed his hands andpicking up a pen he wrote out what, his companions found on perusal, torun in this strain:
  When in my hands I clasp a crab what most enchants my heart is the      cassia's cool shade.  While I pour vinegar and ground ginger, I feel from joy as if I would      go mad.  With so much gluttony the prince's grandson eats his crabs that he      should have some wine.  The side-walking young gentleman has no intestines in his frame at      all.  I lose sight in my greediness that in my stomach cold accumulates.  To my fingers a strong smell doth adhere and though I wash them yet      the smell clings fast.  The main secret of this is that men in this world make much of food.  The P'o Spirit has laughed at them that all their lives they only seek      to eat.
"I could readily compose a hundred stanzas with such verses in no time,"Tai-yue observed with a sarcastic smile.
"Your mental energies are now long ago exhausted," Pao-yue rejoinedlaughingly, "and instead of confessing your inability to devise any, youstill go on heaping invective upon people!"
Tai-yue, upon catching this insinuation, made no reply of any kind; butslightly raising her head she hummed something to herself for a while,and then taking up a pen she completed a whole stanza with a few dashes.
The company then read her lines. They consisted of--
  E'en after death, their armour and their lengthy spears are never cast      away.  So nice they look, piled in the plate, that first to taste them I'd      fain be.  In every pair of legs they have, the crabs are full of tender      jade-like meat.  Each piece of ruddy fat, which in their shell bumps up, emits a      fragrant smell.  Besides much meat, they have a greater relish for me still, eight feet      as well.  Who bids me drink a thousand cups of wine in order to enhance my joy?  What time I can behold their luscious food, with the fine season doth      accord  When cassias wave with fragrance pure, and the chrysanthemums are      decked with frost.
Pao-yue had just finished conning it over and was beginning to sing itspraise, when Tai-yue, with one snatch, tore it to pieces and bade aservant go and burn it.
"As my compositions can't come up to yours," she then observed, "I'llburn it. Yours is capital, much better than the lines you wrote a littletime back on the chrysanthemums, so keep it for the benefit of others."
"I've likewise succeeded, after much effort, in putting together astanza," Pao-ch'ai laughingly remarked. "It cannot, of course, be worthmuch, but I'll put it down for fun's sake."
As she spoke, she too wrote down her lines. When they came to look atthem, they read--
  On this bright beauteous day, I bask in the dryandra shade, with a cup      in my hand.  When I was at Ch'ang An, with drivelling mouth, I longed for the ninth      day of the ninth moon.  The road stretches before their very eyes, but they can't tell between      straight and transverse.  Under their shells in spring and autumn only reigns a vacuum, yellow      and black.
At this point, they felt unable to refrain from shouting: "Excellent!""She abuses in fine style!" Pao-yue shouted. "But my lines should also becommitted to the flames."
The company thereupon scanned the remainder of the stanza, which wascouched in this wise:
  When all the stock of wine is gone, chrysanthemums then use to scour      away the smell.  So as to counteract their properties of gath'ring cold, fresh ginger      you should take.  Alas! now that they have been dropped into the boiling pot, what good      do they derive?  About the moonlit river banks there but remains the fragrant aroma of      corn.
At the close of their perusal, they with one voice, explained that thiswas a first-rate song on crab-eating; that minor themes of this kindshould really conceal lofty thoughts, before they could be held to be ofany great merit, and that the only thing was that it chaffed peoplerather too virulently.
But while they were engaged in conversation, P'ing Erh was again seencoming into the garden. What she wanted is not, however, yet known; so,reader, peruse the details given in the subsequent chapter.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
  The tongue of the village old dame finds as free vent as a river that      has broken its banks.  The affectionate cousin makes up his mind to sift to the very bottom      the story told by old goody Liu.
Upon seeing, the story explains, P'ing Erh arrive, they unanimouslyinquired, "What is your mistress up to? How is it she hasn't come?"
"How ever could she spare the time to get as far as here?" P'ing Erhsmiled and replied. "But, she said, she hasn't anything good to eat, soshe bade me, as she couldn't possibly run over, come and find outwhether there be any more crabs or not; (if there be), she enjoined meto ask for a few to take to her to eat at home."
"There are plenty!" Hsiang-yuen rejoined; and directing, with alacrity, aservant to fetch a present box, she put in it ten of the largest crabs.
"I'll take a few more of the female ones," P'ing Erh remarked.
One and all then laid hands upon P'ing Erh and tried to drag her into aseat, but P'ing Erh would not accede to their importunities.
"I insist upon your sitting down," Li Wan laughingly exclaimed, and asshe kept pulling her about, and forcing her to sit next to her, shefilled a cup of wine and put it to her lips. P'ing Erh hastily swalloweda sip and endeavoured immediately to beat a retreat.
"I won't let you go," shouted Li Wan. "It's so evident that you're onlygot that woman Feng in your thoughts as you don't listen to any of mywords!"
Saying this, she went on to bid the nurses go ahead, and take the boxover. "Tell her," she added, "that I've kept P'ing Erh here."
A matron presently returned with a box. "Lady Secunda," she reported,"says that you, lady Chu, and our young mistresses must not make fun ofher for having asked for something to eat; and that in this box you'llfind cakes made of water-lily powder, and rolls prepared with chickenfat, which your maternal aunt, on the other side, just sent for yourladyship and for you, young ladies, to taste. That she bids you," (thematron) continued, turning towards P'ing Erh, "come over on duty, butyour mind is so set upon pleasure that you loiter behind and don't goback. She advises you, however, not to have too many cups of wine."
"Were I even to have too much," P'ing Erh smiled, "what could she do tome?"
Uttering these words, she went on with her drink; after which shepartook of some more crab.
"What a pity it is," interposed Li Wan, caressing her, "that a girl withsuch good looks as you should have so ordinary a fortune as to simplyfall into that room as a menial! But wouldn't any one, who is notacquainted with actual facts, take you for a lady and a mistress?"
While she went on eating and drinking with Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang-yuen and theother girls, P'ing Erh turned her head round. "Don't rub me like that!"she laughed, "It makes me feel quite ticklish."
"Ai-yo!" shouted Li Wan. "What's this hard thing?"
"It's a key," P'ing Erh answered.
"What fine things have you got that the fear lest people should take itaway, prompts you to carry this about you? I keep on, just for a laugh,telling people the whole day long that when the bonze T'ang was fetchingthe canons, a white horse came and carried him! That when Liu Chih-yueanwas attacking the empire, a melon-spirit appeared and brought him a coatof mail, and that in the same way, where our vixen Feng is, there youare to be found! You are your mistress' general key; and what do youwant this other key for?"
"You've primed yourself with wine, my lady," P'ing Erh smiled, "and hereyou once more chaff me and make a laughing-stock of me."
"This is really quite true," Pao-ch'ai laughed. "Whenever we've gotnothing to do, and we talk matters over, (we're quite unanimous) thatnot one in a hundred could be picked out to equal you girls in here. Thebeauty is that each one of you possesses her own good qualities!"
"In every thing, whether large or small, a heavenly principle rulesalike," Li Wan explained. "Were there, for instance, no Yuean Yang in ourvenerable senior's apartments, how would it ever do? Commencing withMadame Wang herself, who is it who could muster sufficient courage toexpostulate with the old lady? Yet she plainly has the pluck to put inher remonstrances with her; and, as it happens, our worthy ancestorlends a patient ear to only what she says and no one else. None of theothers can remember what our old senior has in the way of clothes andhead-ornaments, but she can remember everything; and, were she not thereto look after things, there is no knowing how many would not be swindledaway. That child besides is so straightforward at heart, that, despiteall this, she often puts in a good word for others, and doesn't relyupon her influence to look down disdainfully upon any one!"
"It was only yesterday," Hsi Ch'un observed with a smile, "that our dearancestor said that she was ever so much better than the whole lot ofus!"
"She's certainly splendid!" P'ing Erh ventured. "How could we rise up toher standard?"
"Ts'ai Hsia," Pao-yue put in, "who is in mother's rooms, is a good sortof girl!"
"Of course she is!" T'an Ch'un assented. "But she's good enough as faras external appearances go, but inwardly she's a sly one! Madame Wang isjust like a joss; she does not give her mind to any sort of business;but this girl is up to everything; and it is she who in all manner ofthings reminds her mistress what there is to be done. She even knowseverything, whether large or small, connected with Mr. Chia Cheng'sstaying at home or going out of doors; and when at any time Madame Wangforgets, she, from behind the scenes, prompts her how to act."
"Well, never mind about her!" Li Wan suggested. "But were," she pursued,pointing at Pao-yue, "no Hsi Jen in this young gentleman's quarters, justyou imagine what a pitch things would reach! That vixen Feng may trulyresemble the prince Pa of the Ch'u kingdom; and she may have two armsstrong enough to raise a tripod weighing a thousand catties, but had shenot this maid (P'ing Erh), would she be able to accomplish everything sothoroughly?"
"In days gone by," P'ing Erh interposed, "four servant-girls came alongwith her, but what with those who've died and those who've gone, only Iremain like a solitary spirit."
"You're, after all, the fortunate one!" Li Wan retorted, "but our husseyFeng too is lucky in having you! Had I not also once, just remember, twogirls, when your senior master Chu was alive? Am I not, you've seen foryourselves, a person to bear with people? But in such a surly frame ofmind did I find them both day after day that, as soon as your seniormaster departed this life, I availed myself of their youth (to give themin marriage) and to pack both of them out of my place. But had either ofthem been good for anything and worthy to be kept, I would, in fact,have now had some one to give me a helping hand!"
As she spoke, the very balls of her eyes suddenly became quite red.
"Why need you again distress your mind?" they with one voice, exclaimed."Isn't it better that we should break up?"
While conversing, they rinsed their hands; and, when they had agreed togo in a company to dowager lady Chia's and Madame Wang's and inquireafter their health, the matrons and servant-maids swept the pavilion andcollected and washed the cups and saucers.
Hsi Jen proceeded on her way along with P'ing Erh. "Come into my room,"said Hsi Jen to P'ing Erh, "and sit down and have another cup of tea."
"I won't have any tea just now," P'ing Erh answered. "I'll come someother time."
So saying, she was about to go off when Hsi Jen called out to her andstopped her.
"This month's allowances," she asked, "haven't yet been issued, not evento our old mistress and Madame Wang; why is it?"
Upon catching this inquiry, P'ing Erh hastily retraced her steps anddrew near Hsi Jen. After looking about to see that no one was in theneighbourhood, she rejoined in a low tone of voice, "Drop thesequestions at once! They're sure, anyhow, to be issued in a couple ofdays."
"Why is it," smiled Hsi Jen, "that this gives you such a start?"
"This month's allowances," P'ing Erh explained to her in a whisper,"have long ago been obtained in advance by our mistress Secunda andgiven to people for their own purposes; and it's when the interest hasbeen brought from here and there that the various sums will be lumpedtogether and payment be effected. I confide this to you, but, mind, youmustn't go and tell any other person about it."
"Is it likely that she hasn't yet enough money for her ownrequirements?" Hsi Jen smiled. "Or is it that she's still not satisfied?And what's the use of her still going on bothering herself in this way?"
"Isn't it so!" laughed P'ing Erh. "From just handling the funds for thisparticular item, she has, during these few years, so manipulated them asto turn up several hundreds of taels profit out of them. Nor does shespend that monthly allowance of hers for public expenses. But the momentshe accumulates anything like eight or ten taels odd, she gives them outtoo. Thus the interest on her own money alone comes up to nearly athousand taels a year."
"You and your mistress take our money," Hsi Jen observed laughingly,"and get interest on it; fooling us as if we were no better thanidiots."
"Here you are again with your uncharitable words!" P'ing Erhremonstrated. "Can it be that you haven't yet enough to meet your ownexpenses with?"
"I am, it's true, not short of money," Hsi Jen replied, "as I havenowhere to go and spend it; but the thing is that I'm making provisionfor that fellow of ours, (Pao-yue)."
"If you ever find yourself in any great straits and need money," P'ingErh resumed, "you're at liberty to take first those few taels I've gotover there to suit your own convenience with, and by and bye I canreduce them from what is due to you and we'll be square."
"I'm not in need of any just now," retorted Hsi Jen. "But should I nothave enough, when I want some, I'll send some one to fetch them, andfinish."
P'ing Erh promised that she would let her have the money at any time shesent for it, and, and taking the shortest cut, she issued out of thegarden gate. Here she encountered a servant despatched from the otherside by lady Feng. She came in search of P'ing Erh. "Our lady," shesaid, "has something for you to do, and is waiting for you."
"What's up that it's so pressing?" P'ing Erh inquired. "Our seniormistress detained me by force to have a chat, so I couldn't manage toget away. But here she time after time sends people after me in thismanner!"
"Whether you go or not is your own look out," the maid replied. "Itisn't worth your while getting angry with me! If you dare, go and tellthese things to our mistress!"
P'ing Erh spat at her contemptuously, and rushed back in anxious haste.She discovered, however, that lady Feng was not at home. Butunexpectedly she perceived that the old goody Liu, who had paid them avisit on a previous occasion for the purpose of obtaining pecuniaryassistance, had come again with Pan Erh, and was seated in the oppositeroom, along with Chang Ts'ai's wife and Chou Jui's wife, who kept hercompany. But two or three servant-maids were inside as well emptying onthe floor bags containing dates, squash and various wild greens.
As soon as they saw her appear in the room, they promptly stood up in abody. Old goody Liu had, on her last visit, learnt what P'ing Erh'sstatus in the establishment was, so vehemently jumping down, sheenquired, "Miss, how do you do? All at home," she pursued, "send youtheir compliments. I meant to have come earlier and paid my respects tomy lady and to look you up, miss; but we've been very busy on the farm.We managed this year to reap, after great labour, a few more piculs ofgrain than usual. But melons, fruits and vegetables have also beenplentiful. These things, you see here, are what we picked during thefirst crop; and as we didn't presume to sell them, we kept the best topresent to our lady and the young ladies to taste. The young ladiesmust, of course, be surfeited with all the delicacies and fine thingsthey daily get, but by having some of our wild greens to eat, they willshow some regard for our poor attention."
"Many thanks for all the trouble you have taken!" Ping Erh eagerlyrejoined. Then pressing her to resume her place, she sat down herself;and, urging Mrs. Chang and Mrs. Chou to take their seats, she bade ayoung waiting-maid go and serve the tea.
"There's a joyous air about your face to-day, Miss, and your eye-ballsare all red," the wife of Chou Jui and the wife of Chang Ts'ai thereuponsmilingly ventured.
"Naturally!" P'ing Erh laughed. "I generally don't take any wine, butour senior mistress, and our young ladies caught hold of me and insistedupon pouring it down my throat. I had no alternative therefore but toswallow two cups full; so my face at once flushed crimson."
"I have a longing for wine," Chang Ts'ai's wife smiled; "but there's noone to offer me any. But when any one by and by invites you, Miss, dotake me along with you!"
At these words, one and all burst out laughing.
"Early this morning," Chou Jui's wife interposed, "I caught a glimpse ofthose crabs. Only two or three of them would weigh a catty; so in thosetwo or three huge hampers, there must have been, I presume, seventy toeighty catties!"
"If some were intended for those above as well as for those below;" ChouJui's wife added, "they couldn't, nevertheless, I fear, have beenenough."
"How could every one have had any?" P'ing Erh observed. "Those simplywith any name may have tasted a couple of them; but, as for the rest,some may have touched them with the tips of their hands, but many mayeven not have done as much."
"Crabs of this kind!" put in old goody Liu, "cost this year fivecandareens a catty; ten catties for five mace; five times five make twotaels five, and three times five make fifteen; and adding what waswanted for wines and eatables, the total must have come to somethingover twenty taels. O-mi-to-fu! why, this heap of money is ample for uscountry-people to live on through a whole year!"
"I expect you have seen our lady?" P'ing Erh then asked.
"Yes, I have seen her," assented old goody Liu. "She bade us wait." Asshe spoke, she again looked out of the window to see what the time ofthe day could be. "It's getting quite late," she afterwards proceeded."We must be going, or else we mayn't be in time to get out of the citygates; and then we'll be in a nice fix."
"Quite right," Chou Jui's wife observed. "I'll go and see what she's upto for you."
With these words, she straightway left the room. After a long absence,she returned. "Good fortune has, indeed, descended upon you, old dame!"she smiled. "Why, you've won the consideration of those two ladies!"
"What about it?" laughingly inquired P'ing Erh and the others.
"Lady Secunda," Chou Jui's wife explained with a smile, "was with ourvenerable lady, so I gently whispered to her: 'old goody Liu wishes togo home; it's getting late and she fears she mightn't be in time to goout of the gates!' 'It's such a long way off!' Our lady Secundarejoined, 'and she had all the trouble and fatigue of carrying that loadof things; so if it's too late, why, let her spend the night here andstart on the morrow!' Now isn't this having enlisted our mistress'sympathies? But not to speak of this! Our old lady also happened tooverhear what we said, and she inquired: 'who is old goody Liu?' Ourlady Secunda forthwith told her all. 'I was just longing,' her venerableladyship pursued, 'for some one well up in years to have a chat with;ask her in, and let me see her!' So isn't this coming in forconsideration, when least unexpected?"
So speaking, she went on to urge old goody Liu to get down and betakeherself to the front.
"With a figure like this of mine," old goody Liu demurred, "how could Ivery well appear before her? My dear sister-in-law, do tell her thatI've gone!"
"Get on! Be quick!" P'ing Erh speedily cried. "What does it matter? Ourold lady has the highest regard for old people and the greatest pity forthe needy! She's not one you could compare with those haughty andoverbearing people! But I fancy you're a little too timid, so I'llaccompany you as far as there, along with Mrs. Chou."
While tendering her services, she and Chou Jui's wife led off old goodyLiu and crossed over to dowager lady Chia's apartments on this side ofthe mansion. The boy-servants on duty at the second gate stood up whenthey saw P'ing Erh approach. But two of them also ran up to her, and,keeping close to her heels: "Miss!" they shouted out. "Miss!"
"What have you again got to say?" P'ing Erh asked.
"It's pretty late just now," one of the boys smilingly remarked; "andmother is ill and wants me to go and call the doctor, so I would, dearMiss, like to have half a day's leave; may I?"
"Your doings are really fine!" P'ing Erh exclaimed. "You've agreed amongyourselves that each day one of you should apply for furlough; butinstead of speaking to your lady, you come and bother me! The other daythat Chu Erh went, Mr. Secundus happened not to want him, so I assented,though I also added that I was doing it as a favour; but here you toocome to-day!"
"It's quite true that his mother is sick," Chou Jui's wife interceded;"so, Miss, do say yes to him also, and let him go!"
"Be back as soon as it dawns to-morrow!" P'ing Erh enjoined. "Wait, I'vegot something for you to do, for you'll again sleep away, and only turnup after the sun has blazed away on your buttocks. As you go now, give amessage to Wang Erh! Tell him that our lady bade you warn him that if hedoes not hand over the balance of the interest due by to-morrow, shewon't have anything to do with him. So he'd better let her have it tomeet her requirements and finish."
The servant-lad felt in high glee and exuberant spirits. Expressing hisobedience, he walked off.
P'ing Erh and her companions repaired then to old lady Chia'sapartments. Here the various young ladies from the Garden of Broad Vistawere at the time assembled paying their respects to their grandmother.As soon as old goody Liu put her foot inside, she saw the room throngedwith girls (as seductive) as twigs of flowers waving to and fro, and sorichly dressed, as to look enveloped in pearls, and encircled withking-fisher ornaments. But she could not make out who they all were. Hergaze was, however, attracted by an old dame, reclining alone on a divan.Behind her sat a girl, a regular beauty, clothed in gauze, engaged inpatting her legs. Lady Feng was on her feet in the act of cracking somejoke.
Old goody Liu readily concluded that it must be dowager lady Chia, sopromptly pressing forward, she put on a forced smile and made severalcurtseys. "My obeisance to you, star of longevity!" she said.
Old lady Chia hastened, on her part, to bow and to inquire after herhealth. Then she asked Chou Jui's wife to bring a chair over for her totake a seat. But Pan Erh was still so very shy that he did not know howto make his obeisance.
"Venerable relative," dowager lady Chia asked, "how old are you thisyear?"
Old goody Liu immediately rose to her feet. "I'm seventy-five thisyear," she rejoined.
"So old and yet so hardy!" Old lady Chia remarked, addressing herself tothe party. "Why she's older than myself by several years! When I reachthat age, I wonder whether I shall be able to move!"
"We people have," old goody Liu smilingly resumed, "to put up, from themoment we come into the world, with ever so many hardships; while yourvenerable ladyship enjoys, from your birth, every kind of blessing! Werewe also like this, there'd be no one to carry on that farming work."
"Are your eyes and teeth still good?" Dowager lady Chia went on toinquire.
"They're both still all right," old goody Liu replied. "The left molars,however, have got rather shaky this year."
"As for me, I'm quite an old fossil," dowager lady Chia observed. "I'mno good whatever. My eyesight is dim; my ears are deaf, my memory isgone. I can't even recollect any of you, old family connections. Whentherefore any of our relations come on a visit, I don't see them forfear lest I should be ridiculed. All I can manage to eat are a fewmouthfuls of anything tender enough for my teeth; and I can just dose abit or, when I feel in low spirits, I distract myself a little withthese grandsons and grand-daughters of mine; that's all I'm good for."
"This is indeed your venerable ladyship's good fortune!" old goody Liusmiled. "We couldn't enjoy anything of the kind, much though we may longfor it."
"What good fortune!" dowager lady Chia exclaimed. "I'm a useless oldthing, no more."
This remark made every one explode into laughter.
Dowager lady Chia also laughed. "I heard our lady Feng say a littlewhile back," she added, "that you had brought a lot of squash andvegetables, and I told her to put them by at once. I had just beencraving to have newly-grown melons and vegetables; but those one buysoutside are not as luscious as those produced in your farms."
"This is the rustic notion," old goody Liu laughed, "to entirely subsiston fresh things! Yet, we long to have fish and meat for our fare, but wecan't afford it."
"I've found a relative in you to-day," dowager lady Chia said, "so youshouldn't go empty-handed! If you don't despise this place as too mean,do stay a day or two before you start! We've also got a garden here; andthis garden produces fruits too; you can taste some of them to-morrowand take a few along with you home, in order to make it look like avisit to relatives."
When lady Feng saw how delighted old lady Chia was with the prospects ofthe old dame's stay, she too lost no time in doing all she could toinduce her to remain. "Our place here," she urged, "isn't, it's true, asspacious as your threshing-floor; but as we've got two vacant rooms,you'd better put up in them for a couple of days, and choose some ofyour village news and old stories and recount them to our worthysenior."
"Now you, vixen Feng," smiled dowager lady Chia, "don't raise a laugh ather expense! She's only a country woman; and will an old dame like herstand any chaff from you?"
While remonstrating with her, she bade a servant go, before attending toanything else, and pluck a few fruits. These she handed to Pan Erh toeat. But Pan Erh did not venture to touch them, conscious as he was ofthe presence of such a number of bystanders. So old lady Chia gaveorders that a few cash should be given him, and then directed the pagesto take him outside to play.
After sipping a cup of tea, old goody Liu began to relate, for thebenefit of dowager lady Chia, a few of the occurrences she had seen orheard of in the country. These had the effect of putting old lady Chiain a more exuberant frame of mind. But in the midst of her narration, aservant, at lady Feng's instance, asked goody Liu to go and have herevening meal. Dowager lady Chia then picked out, as well, several kindsof eatables from her own repast, and charged some one to take them togoody Liu to feast on.
But the consciousness that the old dame had taken her senior's fancyinduced lady Feng to send her back again as soon as she had taken somerefreshments. On her arrival, Yuean Yang hastily deputed a matron to takegoody Liu to have a bath. She herself then went and selected two piecesof ordinary clothes, and these she entrusted to a servant to hand to theold dame to change. Goody Liu had hitherto not set eyes upon any suchgrand things, so with eagerness she effected the necessary alterationsin her costume. This over, she made her appearance outside, and, sittingin front of the divan occupied by dowager lady Chia, she went on tonarrate as many stories as she could recall to mind. Pao-yue and hiscousins too were, at the time, assembled in the room, and as they hadnever before heard anything the like of what she said, they, of course,thought her tales more full of zest than those related by itinerantblind story-tellers.
Old goody Liu was, albeit a rustic person, gifted by nature with a gooddeal of discrimination. She was besides advanced in years; and had gonethrough many experiences in her lifetime, so when she, in the firstplace, saw how extremely delighted old lady Chia was with her, and, inthe second, how eager the whole crowd of young lads and lasses were tolisten to what fell from her mouth, she even invented, when she foundher own stock exhausted, a good many yarns to recount to them.
"What with all the sowing we have to do in our fields and the vegetableswe have to plant," she consequently proceeded, "have we ever in ourvillage any leisure to sit with lazy hands from year to year and day today; no matter whether it's spring, summer, autumn or winter, whether itblows or whether it rains? Yea, day after day all that we can do is toturn the bare road into a kind of pavilion to rest and cool ourselveson! But what strange things don't we see! Last winter, for instance,snow fell for several consecutive days, and it piled up on the groundthree or four feet deep. One day, I got up early, but I hadn't as yetgone out of the door of our house when I heard outside the noise offirewood (being moved). I fancied that some one must have come to stealit, so I crept up to a hole in the window; but, lo, I discovered that itwas no one from our own village."
"It must have been," interposed dowager lady Chia, "some wayfarers, whobeing smitten with the cold, took some of the firewood, they saw readyat hand, to go and make a fire and warm themselves with! That's highlyprobable!"
"It was no wayfarers at all," old goody Liu retorted smiling, "andthat's what makes the story so strange. Who do you think it was,venerable star of longevity? It was really a most handsome girl ofseventeen or eighteen, whose hair was combed as smooth as if oil hadbeen poured over it. She was dressed in a deep red jacket, a white silkpetticoat...."
When she reached this part of her narrative, suddenly became audible thevoices of people bawling outside. "It's nothing much," they shouted,"don't frighten our old mistress!" Dowager lady Chia and the otherinmates caught, however, their cries and hurriedly inquired what hadhappened. A servant-maid explained in reply that a fire had broken outin the stables in the southern court, but that there was no danger, asthe flames had been suppressed.
Their old grandmother was a person with very little nerve. The moment,therefore, the report fell on her car, she jumped up with all despatch,and leaning on one of the family, she rushed on to the verandah toascertain the state of things. At the sight of the still brilliantlight, shed by the flames, on the south east part of the compound, oldlady Chia was plunged in consternation, and invoking Buddha, she went onto shout to the servants to go and burn incense before the god of fire.
Madame Wang and the rest of the members of the household lost no time incrossing over in a body to see how she was getting on. "The fire hasbeen already extinguished," they too assured her, "please, dearancestor, repair into your rooms!"
But it was only after old lady Chia had seen the light of the flamesentirely subside that she at length led the whole company indoors. "Whatwas that girl up to, taking the firewood in that heavy fall of snow?"Pao-yue thereupon vehemently inquired of goody Liu. "What, if she had gotfrostbitten and fallen ill?"
"It was the reference made recently to the firewood that was beingabstracted," his grandmother Chia said, "that brought about this fire;and do you still go on asking more about it? Leave this story alone, andtell us something else!"
Hearing this reminder, Pao-yue felt constrained to drop the subject, muchagainst his wishes, and old goody Liu forthwith thought of somethingelse to tell them.
"In our village," she resumed, "and on the eastern side of ourfarmstead, there lives an old dame, whose age is this year, over ninety.She goes in daily for fasting, and worshipping Buddha. Who'd havethought it, she so moved the pity of the goddess of mercy that she gaveher this message in a dream: 'It was at one time ordained that youshould have no posterity, but as you have proved so devout, I have nowmemorialised the Pearly Emperor to grant you a grandson!' The fact is,this old dame had one son. This son had had too an only son; but he diedafter they had with great difficulty managed to rear him to the age ofseventeen or eighteen. And what tears didn't they shed for him! But, incourse of time, another son was actually born to him. He is this yearjust thirteen or fourteen, resembles a very ball of flower, (so plump ishe), and is clever and sharp to an exceptional degree! So this is indeeda clear proof that those spirits and gods do exist!"
This long tirade proved to be in harmony with dowager lady Chia's andMadame Wang's secret convictions on the subject. Even Madame Wangtherefore listened to every word with all profound attention. Pao-yue,however, was so pre-occupied with the story about the stolen firewoodthat he fell in a brown study and gave way to conjectures.
"Yesterday," T'an Ch'un at this point remarked, "We put cousin Shih to alot of trouble and inconvenience, so, when we get back, we must consultabout convening a meeting, and, while returning her entertainment, wecan also invite our venerable ancestor to come and admire thechrysanthemums; what do you think of this?"
"Our worthy senior," smiled Pao-yue, "has intimated that she means togive a banquet to return cousin Shih's hospitality, and to ask us to dothe honours. Let's wait therefore until we partake of grandmother'scollation, before we issue our own invitations; there will be ample timethen to do so."
"The later it gets, the cooler the weather becomes," T'an Ch'unobserved, "and our dear senior is not likely to enjoy herself."
"Grandmother," added Pao-yue, "is also fond of rain and snow, so wouldn'tit be as well to wait until the first fall, and then ask her to come andlook at the snow. This will be better, won't it? And were we to reciteour verses with snow about us, it will be ever so much more fun!"
"To hum verses in the snow," Lin Tai-yue speedily demurred with a smile,"won't, in my idea, be half as nice as building up a heap of firewoodand then stealing it, with the flakes playing about us. This will be byfar more enjoyable!"
This proposal made Pao-ch'ai and the others laugh. Pao-yue cast a glanceat her but made no reply.
But, in a short time, the company broke up. Pao-yue eventually gave oldgoody Liu a tug on the sly and plied her with minute questions as to whothe girl was. The old dame was placed under the necessity of fabricatingsomething for his benefit. "The truth is," she said, "that there standson the north bank of the ditch in our village a small ancestral hall, inwhich offerings are made, but not to spirits or gods. There was informer days some official or other..."
"While speaking, she went on to try and recollect his name and surname.
"No matter about names or surnames!" Pao-yue expostulated. "There's noneed for you to recall them to memory! Just mention the facts; they'llbe enough."
"This official," old goody Liu resumed, "had no son. His offspringconsisted of one young daughter, who went under the name of Jo Yue, (likeJade). She could read and write, and was doated upon by this officialand his consort, just as if she were a precious jewel. But,unfortunately, when this young lady, Jo Yue, grew up to be seventeen, shecontracted some disease and died."
When these words fell on Pao-yue's ears, he stamped his foot and heaved asigh. "What happened after that?" he then asked.
Old goody Liu pursued her story.
"So incessantly," she continued, "did this official and his consortthink of their child that they raised this ancestral hall, erected aclay image of their young daughter Jo Yue in it, and appointed some oneto burn incense and trim the fires. But so many days and years have nowelapsed that the people themselves are no more alive, the temple is indecay, and the image itself is become a spirit."
"It hasn't become a spirit," remonstrated Pao-yue with vehemence. "Humanbeings of this kind may, the rule is, die, yet they are not dead."
"O-mi-to-fu!" ejaculated old goody Liu; "is it really so! Had you, sir,not enlightened us, we would have remained under the impression that shehad become a spirit! But she repeatedly transforms herself into a humanbeing, and there she roams about in every village, farmstead, inn androadside. And the one I mentioned just now as having taken the firewoodis that very girl! The villagers in our place are still consulting withthe idea of breaking this clay image and razing the temple to theground."
"Be quick and dissuade them!" eagerly exclaimed Pao-yue. "Were they toraze the temple to the ground, their crime won't be small."
"It's lucky that you told me, Sir," old goody Liu added. "When I getback to-morrow, I'll make them relinquish the idea and finish!"
"Our venerable senior and my mother," Pao-yue pursued, "are bothcharitable persons. In fact, all the inmates of our family, whether oldor young, do, in like manner, delight in good deeds, and take pleasurein distributing alms. Their greatest relish is to repair temples, and toput up images to the spirits; so to-morrow, I'll make a subscription andcollect a few donations for you, and you can then act as incense-burner.When sufficient money has been raised, this fane can be repaired, andanother clay image put up; and month by month I'll give you incense andfire money to enable you to burn joss-sticks; won't this be A good thingfor you?"
"In that case," old goody Liu rejoined, "I shall, thanks to that younglady's good fortune, have also a few cash to spend."
Pao-yue thereupon likewise wanted to know what the name of the place was,the name of the village, how far it was there and back, and whereaboutthe temple was situated.
Old goody Liu replied to his questions, by telling him every idlethought that came first to her lips. Pao-yue, however, credited theinformation she gave him and, on his return to his rooms, he exercised,the whole night, his mind with building castles in the air.
On the morrow, as soon as daylight dawned, he speedily stepped out ofhis room, and, handing Pei Ming several hundreds of cash, he bade himproceed first in the direction and to the place specified by old goodyLiu, and clearly ascertain every detail, so as to enable him, on hisreturn from his errand, to arrive at a suitable decision to carry outhis purpose. After Pei Ming's departure, Pao-yue continued on pins onneedles and on the tiptoe of expectation. Into such a pitch ofexcitement did he work himself, that he felt like an ant in a burningpan. With suppressed impatience, he waited and waited until sunset. Atlast then he perceived Pei Ming walk in, in high glee.
"Have you discovered the place?" hastily inquired Pao-yue.
"Master," Pei Ming laughed, "you didn't catch distinctly the directionsgiven you, and you made me search in a nice way! The name of the placeand the bearings can't be those you gave me, Sir; that is why I've hadto hunt about the whole day long! I prosecuted my inquiries up to thevery ditch on the north east side, before I eventually found a ruinedtemple."
Upon hearing the result of his researches, Pao-yue was much gratified.His very eyebrows distended. His eyes laughed. "Old goody Liu," he saidwith eagerness, "is a person well up in years, and she may at the momenthave remembered wrong; it's very likely she did. But recount to me whatyou saw."
"The door of that temple," Pei Ming explained, "really faces south, andis all in a tumble-down condition. I searched and searched till I wasdriven to utter despair. As soon, however, as I caught sight of it,'that's right,' I shouted, and promptly walked in. But I at oncediscovered a clay figure, which gave me such a fearful start, that Iscampered out again; for it looked as much alive as if it were a realliving being."
Pao-yue smiled full of joy. "It can metamorphose itself into a humanbeing," he observed, "so, of course, it has more or less a life-likeappearance."
"Was it ever a girl?" Pei Ming rejoined clapping his hands. "Why it was,in fact, no more than a green-faced and red-haired god of plagues."
Pao-yue, at this answer, spat at him contemptuously. "You are, in verytruth, a useless fool!" he cried. "Haven't you even enough gumption forsuch a trifling job as this?"
"What book, I wonder, have you again been reading, master?" Pei Mingcontinued. "Or you may, perhaps, have heard some one prattle a lot oftrash and believed it as true! You send me on this sort of wild goosechase and make me go and knock my head about, and how can you ever saythat I'm good for nothing?"
Pao-yue did not fail to notice that he was in a state of exasperation sohe lost no time in trying to calm him. "Don't be impatient!" he urged."You can go again some other day, when you've got nothing to attend to,and institute further inquiries! If it turns out that she hashood-winked us, why, there will, naturally, be no such thing. But if,verily, there is, won't you also lay up for yourself a store of gooddeeds? I shall feel it my duty to reward you in a most handsome manner."
As he spoke, he espied a servant-lad, on service at the second gate,approach and report to him: "The young ladies in our venerableladyship's apartments are standing at the threshold of the second gateand looking out for you, Mr. Secundus."
But as, reader, you are not aware what they were on the look-out to tellhim, the subsequent chapter will explain it for you.

CHAPTER XL.
  The venerable lady Shih attends a second banquet in the garden of      Broad Vista.  Chin Yuean-yang three times promulgates, by means of dominoes, the      order to quote passages from old writers.
As soon as Pao-yue, we will now explain, heard what the lad told him, herushed with eagerness inside. When he came to look about him, hediscovered Hu Po standing in front of the screen. "Be quick and go," sheurged. "They're waiting to speak to you."
Pao-yue wended his way into the drawing rooms. Here he found dowager ladyChia, consulting with Madame Wang and the whole body of young ladies,about the return feast to be given to Shih Hsiang-yuen.
"I've got a plan to suggest," he consequently interposed. "As there areto be no outside guests, the eatables too should not be limited to anykind or number. A few of such dishes, as have ever been to the liking ofany of us, should be fixed upon and prepared for the occasion. Neithershould any banquet be spread, but a high teapoy can be placed in frontof each, with one or two things to suit our particular tastes. Besides,a painted box with partitions and a decanter. Won't this be an originalway?"
"Capital!" shouted old lady Chia. "Go and tell the people in the cookhouse," she forthwith ordered a servant, "to get ready to-morrow suchdishes as we relish, and to put them in as many boxes as there will bepeople, and bring them over. We can have breakfast too in the garden."
But while they were deliberating, the time came to light the lamps.Nothing of any note transpired the whole night. The next day, they gotup at early dawn. The weather, fortunately, was beautifully clear. LiWan turned out of bed at daybreak. She was engaged in watching the oldmatrons and servant-girls sweeping the fallen leaves, rubbing the tablesand chairs, and preparing the tea and wine vessels, when she perceivedFeng Erh usher in old goody Liu and Pan Erh. "You're very busy, oursenior lady!" they said.
"I told you that you wouldn't manage to start yesterday," Li Wan smiled,"but you were in a hurry to get away."
"Your worthy old lady," goody Liu replied laughingly, "wouldn't let mego. She wanted me to enjoy myself too for a day before I went."
Feng Erh then produced several large and small keys. "Our mistress Liensays," she remarked, "that she fears that the high teapoys which are outare not enough, and she thinks it would be as well to open the loft andtake out those that are put away and use them for a day. Our lady shouldreally have come and seen to it in person, but as she has something totell Madame Wang, she begs your ladyship to open the place, and get afew servants to bring them out."
Li Wan there and then told Su Yuen to take the keys. She also bade amatron go out and call a few servant-boys from those on duty at thesecond gate. When they came, Li Wan remained in the lower story of theTa Kuan loft, and looking up, she ordered the servants to go and openthe Cho Chin hall and to bring the teapoys one by one. The youngservant-lads, matrons and servant-maids then set to work, in a body, andcarried down over twenty of them.
"Be careful with them," shouted Li Wan. "Don't be bustling about just asif you were being pursued by ghosts! Mind you don't break the tenons!"Turning her head round, "old dame," she observed, addressing herselfsmilingly to goody Liu, "go upstairs too and have a look!"
Old goody Liu was longing to satisfy her curiosity, so at the baremention of the permission, she uttered just one word ("come") and,dragging Pan Erh along, she trudged up the stairs. On her arrivalinside, she espied, pile upon pile, a whole heap of screens, tables andchairs, painted lanterns of different sizes, and other similar articles.She could not, it is true, make out the use of the various things, but,at the sight of so many colours, of such finery and of the unusualbeauty of each article, she muttered time after time the name of Buddha,and then forthwith wended her way downstairs. Subsequently (theservants) locked the doors and every one of them came down.
"I fancy," cried Li Wan, "that our dowager lady will feel disposed (togo on the water), so you'd better also get the poles, oars and awningsfor the boats and keep them in readiness."
The servants expressed their obedience. Once more they unlocked thedoors, and carried down everything required. She then bade a lad notifythe boatwomen go to the dock and punt out two boats. But while all thisbustle was going on, they discovered that dowager lady Chia had alreadyarrived at the head of a whole company of people. Li Wan promptly wentup to greet them.
"Dear venerable senior," she smiled, "you must be in good spirits tohave come in here! Imagining that you hadn't as yet combed your hair, Ijust plucked a few chrysanthemums, meaning to send them to you."
While she spoke, Pi Yueeh at once presented to her a jadite tray, of thesize of a lotus leaf, containing twigs cut from every species ofchrysanthemum. Old lady Chia selected a cluster of deep red and pinnedit in her hair about her temples. But turning round, she noticed oldgoody Liu. "Come over here," she vehemently cried with a smile; "and puton a few flowers."
Scarcely was this remark concluded, than lady Feng dragged goody Liuforward. "Let me deck you up!" she laughed. With these words, she seizeda whole plateful of flowers and stuck them three this way, four thatway, all over her head. Old lady Chia, and the whole party were greatlyamused; so much so, that they could not check themselves.
"I wonder," shouted goody Liu smiling, "what blessings I have broughtupon my head that such honours are conferred upon it to-day!"
"Don't you yet pull them away," they all laughed, "and chuck them in herface! She has got you up in such a way as to make a regular old elf ofyou!"
"I'm an old hag, I admit," goody Liu pursued with a laugh; "but when Iwas young, I too was pretty and fond of flowers and powder! But the bestthing I can do now is to keep to such fineries as befit my advancedage!"
While they bandied words, they reached the Hsin Fang pavilion. Thewaiting maids brought a large embroidered rug and spread it over theplanks of the divan near the balustrade. On this rug dowager lady Chiasat, with her back leaning against the railing; and, inviting goody Liuto also take a seat next to her, "Is this garden nice or not?" she askedher.
Old goody Liu invoked Buddha several times. "We country-people," sherejoined, "do invariably come, at the close of each year, into the cityand buy pictures and stick them about. And frequently do we findourselves in our leisure moments wondering how we too could manage toget into the pictures, and walk about the scenes they represent. Ipresumed that those pictures were purely and simply fictitious, for howcould there be any such places in reality? But, contrary to myexpectations, I found, as soon as I entered this garden to-day and had alook about it, that it was, after all, a hundred times better than thesevery pictures. But if only I could get some one to make me a sketch ofthis garden, to take home with me and let them see it, so that when wedie we may have reaped some benefit!"
Upon catching the wish she expressed, dowager lady Chia pointed at HsiCh'un. "Look at that young granddaughter of mine!" she smiled. "She'sgot the knack of drawing. So what do you say to my asking her to-morrowto make a picture for you?"
This suggestion filled goody Liu with enthusiasm and speedily crossingover, she clasped Hsi Ch'un in her arms. "My dear Miss!" she cried, "soyoung in years, and yet so pretty, and so accomplished too! Mightn't yoube a spirit come to life!"
After old lady Chia had had a little rest, she in person took goody Liuand showed her everything there was to be seen. First, they visited theHsiao Hsiang lodge. The moment they stepped into the entrance, a narrowavenue, flanked on either side with kingfisher-like green bamboos, mettheir gaze. The earth below was turfed all over with moss. In thecentre, extended a tortuous road, paved with pebbles. Goody Liu leftdowager lady Chia and the party walk on the raised road, while sheherself stepped on the earth. But Hu Po tugged at her. "Come up, olddame, and walk here!" she exclaimed. "Mind the fresh moss is slipperyand you might fall."
"I don't mind it!" answered goody Liu. "We people are accustomed towalking (on such slippery things)! So, young ladies, please proceed. Anddo look after your embroidered shoes! Don't splash them with mud."
But while bent upon talking with those who kept on the raised road, sheunawares reached a spot, which was actually slippery, and with a soundof "ku tang" she tumbled over.
The whole company clapped their hands and laughed boisterously.
"You young wenches," shouted out dowager lady Chia, "don't you yet raiseher up, but stand by giggling?"
This reprimand was still being uttered when goody Liu had alreadycrawled up. She too was highly amused. "Just as my mouth was bragging,"she observed, "I got a whack on the lips!"
"Have you perchance twisted your waist?" inquired old lady Chia. "Tellthe servant-girls to pat it for you!"
"What an idea!" retorted goody Liu, "am I so delicate? What day evergoes by without my tumbling down a couple of times? And if I had to bepatted every time wouldn't it be dreadful!"
Tzu Chuan had at an early period raised the speckled bamboo portiere.Dowager lady Chia and her companions entered and seated themselves. LinTai-yue with her own hands took a small tray and came to present acovered cup of tea to her grandmother.
"We won't have any tea!" Madame Wang interposed, "so, miss, you needn'tpour any."
Lin Tai-yue, hearing this, bade a waiting-maid fetch the chair from underthe window where she herself often sat, and moving it to the lower side,she pressed Madame Wang into it. But goody Liu caught sight of thepencils and inkslabs, lying on the table placed next to the window, andespied the bookcase piled up to the utmost with books. "This mustsurely," the old dame ejaculated, "be some young gentleman's study!"
"This is the room of this granddaughter-in-law of mine," dowager ladyChia explained, smilingly pointing to Tai-yue.
Goody Liu scrutinised Lin Tai-yue with intentness for a while. "Is thisanything like a young lady's private room?" she then observed with asmile. "Why, in very deed, it's superior to any first class library!"
"How is it I don't see Pao-yue?" his grandmother Chia went on to inquire.
"He's in the boat, on the pond," the waiting-maids, with one voice,returned for answer.
"Who also got the boats ready?" old lady Chia asked.
"The loft was open just now so they were taken out," Li Wan said, "andas I thought that you might, venerable senior, feel inclined to have arow, I got everything ready."
After listening to this explanation, dowager lady Chia was about to passsome remark, but some one came and reported to her that Mrs. Hsueeh hadarrived. No sooner had old lady Chia and the others sprung to their feetthan they noticed that Mrs. Hsueeh had already made her appearance. Whiletaking a seat: "Your venerable ladyship," she smiled, "must be incapital spirits to-day to have come at this early hour!"
"It's only this very minute that I proposed that any one who came late,should be fined," dowager lady Chia laughed, "and, who'd have thoughtit, here you, Mrs. Hsueeh, arrive late!"
After they had indulged in good-humoured raillery for a time, old ladyChia's attention was attracted by the faded colour of the gauze on thewindows, and she addressed herself to Madame Wang. "This gauze," shesaid, "may have been nice enough when it was newly pasted, but after atime nothing remained of kingfisher green. In this court too there areno peach or apricot trees and these bamboos already are green inthemselves, so were this shade of green gauze to be put up again, itwould, instead of improving matters, not harmonise with thesurroundings. I remember that we had at one time four or five kinds ofcoloured gauzes for sticking on windows, so give her some to-morrow tochange that on there."
"When I opened the store yesterday," hastily put in Lady Feng, "Inoticed that there were still in those boxes, made of large planks,several rolls of 'cicada wing' gauze of silvery red colour. There werealso several rolls with designs of twigs of flowers of every kind,several with 'the rolling clouds and bats' pattern, and several withfigures representing hundreds of butterflies, interspersed amongflowers. The colours of all these were fresh, and the gauze supple. ButI failed to see anything of the kind you speak of. Were two rolls taken(from those I referred to), and a couple of bed-covers of embroideredgauze made out of them, they would, I fancy, be a pretty sight!"
"Pshaw!" laughed old lady Chia, "every one says that there's nothing youhaven't gone through and nothing you haven't seen, and don't you evenknow what this gauze is? Will you again brag by and bye, after this?"
Mrs. Hsueeh and all the others smiled. "She may have gone through a gooddeal," they remarked, "but how can she ever presume to pit herselfagainst an old lady like you? So why don't you, venerable senior, tellher what it is so that we too may be edified."
Lady Feng too gave a smile. "My dear ancestor," she pleaded, "do tell mewhat it is like."
Dowager lady Chia thereupon proceeded to enlighten Mrs. Hsueeh and thewhole company. "That gauze is older in years than any one of you," shesaid. "It isn't therefore to be wondered, if you make a mistake and takeit for 'cicada wing' gauze. But it really bears some resemblance to it;so much so, indeed, that any one, not knowing the difference, wouldimagine it to be the 'cicada wing' gauze. Its true name, however, is'soft smoke' silk."
"This is also a nice sounding name," lady Feng agreed. "But up to theage I've reached, I have never heard of any such designation, in spiteof the many hundreds of specimens of gauzes and silks, I've seen."
"How long can you have lived?" old lady Chia added smilingly, "and howmany kinds of things can you have met, that you indulge in this talltalk? Of this 'soft smoke' silk, there only exist four kinds of colours.The one is red-blue; the other is russet; the other pine-green; theother silvery-red; and it's because, when made into curtains or stuck onwindow-frames, it looks from far like smoke or mist, that it is called'soft smoke' silk. The silvery-red is also called 'russet shadow' gauze.Among the gauzes used in the present day, in the palace above, there arenone so supple and rich, light and closely-woven as this!"
"Not to speak of that girl Feng not having seen it," Mrs. Hsueeh laughed,"why, even I have never so much as heard anything of it."
While the conversation proceeded in this strain, lady Feng soon directeda servant to fetch a roll. "Now isn't this the kind!" dowager lady Chiaexclaimed. "At first, we simply had it stuck on the window frames, butwe subsequently used it for covers and curtains, just for a trial, andreally they were splendid! So you had better to-morrow try and findseveral rolls, and take some of the silvery-red one and have it fixed onthe windows for her."
While lady Feng promised to attend to her commission, the partyscrutinised it, and unanimously extolled it with effusion. Old goody Liutoo strained her eyes and examined it, and her lips incessantly mutteredBuddha's name. "We couldn't," she ventured, "afford to make clothes ofsuch stuff, much though we may long to do so; and won't it be a pity touse it for sticking on windows?"
"But it doesn't, after all, look well, when made into clothes," old ladyChia explained.
Lady Feng hastily pulled out the lapel of the deep-red brocaded gauzejacket she had on, and, facing dowager lady Chia and Mrs. Hsueeh, "Lookat this jacket of mine," she remarked.
"This is also of first-rate quality!" old lady Chia and Mrs. Hsueehrejoined. "This is nowadays made in the palace for imperial use, but itcan't possibly come up to this!"
"It's such thin stuff," lady Feng observed, "and do you still say thatit was made in the palace for imperial use? Why, it doesn't, in fact,compare favourably with even this, which is worn by officials!"
"You'd better search again!" old lady Chia urged; "I believe there mustbe more of it! If there be, bring it all out, and give this old relativeLiu a couple of rolls! Should there be any red-blue, I'll make a curtainto hang up. What remains can be matched with some lining, and cut into afew double waistcoats for the waiting-maids to wear. It would be sheerwaste to keep these things, as they will be spoilt by the damp."
Lady Feng vehemently acquiesced; after which, she told a servant to takethe gauze away.
"These rooms are so small!" dowager lady Chia then observed, smiling."We had better go elsewhere for a stroll."
"Every one says," old goody Liu put in, "that big people live in bighouses! When I saw yesterday your main apartments, dowager lady, withall those large boxes, immense presses, big tables, and spacious beds tomatch, they did, indeed, present an imposing sight! Those presses arelarger than our whole house; yea loftier too! But strange to say therewere ladders in the back court. 'They don't also,' I thought, 'go up tothe house tops to sun things, so what can they keep those ladders inreadiness for?' Well, after that, I remembered that they must berequired for opening the presses to take out or put in things. And thatwithout those ladders, how could one ever reach that height? But nowthat I've also seen these small rooms, more luxuriously got up than thelarge ones, and full of various articles, all so fascinating and hardlyeven known to me by name, I feel, the more I feast my eyes on them, themore unable to tear myself away from them."
"There are other things still better than this," lady Feng added. "I'lltake you to see them all!"
Saying this, they straightway left the Hsiao Hsiang lodge. From adistance, they spied a whole crowd of people punting the boats in thelake.
"As they've got the boats ready," old lady Chia proposed, "we may aswell go and have a row in them!"
As she uttered this suggestion, they wended their steps along thepersicary-covered bank of the Purple Lily Isle. But before reaching thelake, they perceived several matrons advancing that way with largemulti-coloured boxes in their hands, made all alike of twisted wire andinlaid with gold. Lady Feng hastened to inquire of Madame Wang wherebreakfast was to be served.
"Ask our venerable senior," Madame Wang replied, "and let them lay itwherever she pleases."
Old lady Chia overheard her answer, and turning her head round: "MissTertia," she said, "take the servants, and make them lay breakfastwherever you think best! We'll get into the boats from here."
Upon catching her senior's wishes, lady Feng retraced her footsteps, andaccompanied by Li Wan, T'an Ch'un, Yuean Yang and Hu Po, she led off theservants, carrying the eatables, and other domestics, and came by thenearest way, to the Ch'iu Shuang library, where they arranged the tablesin the Hsiao Ts'ui hall.
"We daily say that whenever the gentlemen outside have anything to drinkor eat, they invariably have some one who can raise a laugh and whomthey can chaff for fun's sake," Yuan Yang smiled, "so let's also to-dayget a female family-companion."
Li Wan, being a person full of kindly feelings, did not fathom theinsinuation, though it did not escape her ear. Lady Feng, however,thoroughly understood that she alluded to old goody Liu. "Let us tooto-day," she smilingly remarked, "chaff her for a bit of fun!"
These two then began to mature their plans.
Li Wan chided them with a smile. "You people," she said, "don't knoweven how to perform the least good act! But you're not small childrenany more, and are you still up to these pranks? Mind, our venerableancestor might call you to task!"
"That has nothing whatever to do with you, senior lady," Yuean Yanglaughed, "it's my own look out!"
These words were still on her lips, when she saw dowager lady Chia andthe rest of the company arrive. They each sat where and how theypleased. First and foremost, a waiting-maid brought two trays of tea.After tea, lady Feng laid hold of a napkin, made of foreign cloth, inwhich were wrapped a handful of blackwood chopsticks, encircled withthree rings, of inlaid silver, and distributed them on the tables, inthe order in which they were placed.
"Bring that small hard-wood table over," old lady Chia then exclaimed;"and let our relative Liu sit next to me here!"
No sooner did the servants hear her order than they hurried to move thetable to where she wanted it. Lady Feng, during this interval, made asign with her eye to Yuean Yang. Yuean Yang there and then dragged goodyLiu out of the hall and began to impress in a low tone of voice variousthings on her mind. "This is the custom which prevails in ourhousehold," she proceeded, "and if you disregard it we'll have a laughat your expense!"
Having arranged everything she had in view, they at length returned totheir places. Mrs. Hsueeh had come over, after her meal, so she simplyseated herself on one side and sipped her tea. Dowager lady Chia withPao-yue, Hsiang-yuen, Tai-yue and Pao-ch'ai sat at one table. Madame Wangtook the girls, Ying Ch'un, and her sisters, and occupied one table. Oldgoody Liu took a seat at a table next to dowager lady Chia. Heretofore,while their old mistress had her repast, a young servant-maid usuallystood by her to hold the finger bowl, yak-brush, napkin and other suchnecessaries, but Yuean Yang did not of late fulfil any of these duties,so when, on this occasion, she deliberately seized the yak-brush andcame over and flapped it about, the servant-girls concluded that she wasbent upon playing some tricks upon goody Liu, and they readily withdrewand let her have her way.
While Yuean Yang attended to her self-imposed duties, she winked at theold dame.
"Miss," goody Liu exclaimed, "set your mind at ease!" Goody Liu sat downat the table and took up the chopsticks, but so heavy and clumsy did shefind them that she could not handle them conveniently. The fact is thatlady Feng and Yuean Yang had put their heads together and decided to onlyassign to goody Liu a pair of antiquated four-cornered ivory chopsticks,inlaid with gold.
"These forks," shouted goody Liu, after scrutinising them, "are heavierthan the very iron-lever over at my place. How ever can I move themabout?"
This remark had the effect of making every one explode into a fit oflaughter. But a married woman standing in the centre of the room, with abox in her hands, attracted their gaze. A waiting-maid went up to herand removed the cover of the box. Its contents were two bowls ofeatables. Li Wan took one of these and placed it on dowager lady Chia'stable, while lady Feng chose the bowl with pigeon's eggs and put it ongoody Liu's table.
"Please (commence)," Dowager lady Chia uttered from the near side, whereshe sat.
Goody Liu at this speedily sprung to her feet. "Old Liu, old Liu," sheroared with a loud voice, "your eating capacity is as big as that of abuffalo! You've gorged like an old sow and can't raise your head up!"Then puffing out her cheeks, she added not a word.
The whole party was at first taken quite aback. But, as soon as theyheard the drift of her remarks, every one, both high as well as low,began to laugh boisterously. Hsiang-yuen found it so difficult torestrain herself that she spurted out the tea she had in her mouth. LinTai-yue indulged in such laughter that she was quite out of breath, andpropping herself up on the table, she kept on ejaculating 'Ai-yo.'Pao-yue rolled into his grandmother's lap. The old lady herself was soamused that she clasped Pao-yue in her embrace, and gave way to endearingepithets. Madame Wang laughed, and pointed at lady Feng with her finger;but as for saying a word, she could not. Mrs. Hsueeh had much difficultyin curbing her mirth, and she sputtered the tea, with which her mouthwas full, all over T'an Ch'un's petticoat. T'an Ch'un threw the contentsof the teacup, she held in her hand, over Ying Ch'un; while Hsi Ch'unquitted her seat, and, pulling her nurse away, bade her rub her stomachfor her.
Below, among the lower seats, there was not one who was not with bentwaist and doubled-up back. Some retired to a corner and, squatting down,laughed away. Others suppressed their laughter and came up and changedthe clothes of their young mistresses. Lady Feng and Yuan Yang were theonly ones, who kept their countenance. Still they continued helping oldgoody Liu to food.
Old goody Liu took up the chopsticks. "Even the chickens in this placeare fine," she went on to add, pretending, she did not hear what wasgoing on; "the eggs they lay are small, but so dainty! How very prettythey are! Let me help myself to one!"
The company had just managed to check themselves, but, the moment thesewords fell on their ears, they started again with their laughter. Oldlady Chia laughed to such an extent that tears streamed from her eyes.And so little could she bear the strain any longer that Hu Po stoodbehind her and patted her.
"This must be the work of that vixen Feng!" old lady Chia laughed. "Shehas ever been up to tricks like a very imp, so be quick and disbelieveall her yarns!"
Goody Liu was in the act of praising the eggs as small yet dainty, whenlady Feng interposed with a smile. "They're one tael each, be quick, andtaste them;" she said; "they're not nice when they get cold!"
Goody Liu forthwith stretched out the chopsticks with the intent ofcatching one; but how could she manage to do so? They rolled and rolledin the bowl for ever so long; and, it was only after extreme difficultythat she succeeded in shoving one up. Extending her neck forward, shewas about to put it in her mouth, when it slipped down again, and rolledon to the floor. She hastily banged down the chopsticks, and was goingherself to pick it up, when a servant, who stood below, got hold of itand took it out of the room.
Old goody Liu heaved a sigh. "A tael!" she soliloquised, "and here itgoes without a sound!"
Every one had long ago abandoned all idea of eating, and, gazing at her,they enjoyed the fun.
"Who has now brought out these chopsticks again?" old lady Chia went onto ask. "We haven't invited any strangers or spread any large banquet!It must be that vixen Feng who gave them out! But don't you yet changethem!"
The servants, standing on the floor below, had indeed had no hand ingetting those ivory chopsticks; they had, in fact, been brought by ladyFeng and Yuean Yang; but when they heard these remarks, they hurried toput them away and to change them for a pair similar to those used by theothers, made of blackwood inlaid with silver.
"They've taken away the gold ones," old goody Liu shouted, "and herecome silver ones! But, after all, they're not as handy as those we use!"
"Should there be any poison in the viands," lady Feng observed, "you candetect it, as soon as this silver is dipped into them!"
"If there's poison in such viands as these," old goody Liu added, "whythose of ours must be all arsenic! But though it be the death of me,I'll swallow every morsel!"
Seeing how amusing the old woman was and with what relish she devouredher food, dowager lady Chia took her own dishes and passed them over toher.
She then likewise bade an old matron take various viands and put them ina bowl for Pan Erh. But presently, the repast was concluded, and oldlady Chia and all the other inmates adjoined into T'an Ch'un's bedroomfor a chat.
The remnants were, meanwhile, cleared away, and fresh tables were laid.
Old goody Liu watched Li Wan and lady Feng sit opposite each other andeat. "Putting everything else aside," she sighed, "what most takes myfancy is the way things are done in your mansion. It isn't to bewondered at that the adage has it that: 'propriety originates from greatfamilies.'"
"Don't be too touchy," lady Feng hastily smiled, "we all made fun of youjust now."
But barely had she done speaking, when Yuean Yang too walked in. "Oldgoody Liu," she said laughingly, "don't be angry! I tender you myapologies, venerable dame!"
"What are you saying, Miss?" old goody Liu rejoined smiling. "We'vecoaxed our dowager lady to get a little distraction; and what reason isthere to be angry? From the very first moment you spoke to me, I knew atonce that it was intended to afford merriment to you all! Had I beenangry at heart, I wouldn't have gone so far as to say what I did!"
Yuean Yang then blew up the servants. "Why," she shouted, "don't you poura cup of tea for the old dame?"
"That sister-in-law," promptly explained old goody Liu, "gave me a cup alittle while back. I've had it already. But you, Miss, must also havesomething to eat."
Lady Feng dragged Yuean Yang into a seat. "Have your meal with us!" shesaid. "You'll thus save another fuss by and bye."
Yuean Yang readily seated herself. The matrons came up and added to thenumber of bowls and chopsticks, and the trio went through their meal.
"From all I see," smiled goody Liu, "you people eat just a little andfinish. It's lucky you don't feel the pangs of hunger! But it isn'tastonishing if a whiff of wind can puff you over!"
"A good many eatables remained over to-day. Where are they all gone to?"Yuean Yang inquired.
"They haven't as yet been apportioned!" the matrons responded. "They'rekept in here until they can be given in a lump to them to eat!"
"They can't get through so many things!" Yuean Yang resumed. "You had aswell therefore choose two bowls and send them over to that girl P'ing,in your mistress Secundus' rooms."
"She has had her repast long ago." lady Feng put in. "There's no need togive her any!"
"With what she can't eat, herself," Yuean Yang continued, "she can feedthe cats."
At these words, a matron lost no time in selecting two sorts ofeatables, and, taking the box, she went to take them over.
"Where's Su Yun gone to?" Yuean Yang asked.
"They're all in here having their meal together." Li Wan replied. "Whatdo you want her for again?"
"Well, in that case, never mind," Yuean Yang answered.
"Hsi Jen isn't here," lady Feng observed, "so tell some one to take hera few things!"
Yuan Yang, hearing this, directed a servant to send her also a feweatables. "Have the partition boxes been filled with wine for by andbye?" Yuean Yang went on to ask the matrons.
"They'll be ready, I think, in a little while," a matron explained.
"Hurry them up a bit!" Yuean Yang added.
The matron signified her assent.
Lady Feng and her friends then came into T'an Ch'un's apartments, wherethey found the ladies chatting and laughing.
T'an Ch'un had ever shown an inclination for plenty of room. Hence thatsuite of three apartments had never been partitioned. In the centre wasplaced a large table of rosewood and Ta li marble. On this table, werelaid in a heap every kind of copyslips written by persons of note.Several tens of valuable inkslabs and various specimens of tubes andreceptacles for pens figured also about; the pens in which were asthickly packed as trees in a forest. On the off side, stood a flowerbowl from the 'Ju' kiln, as large as a bushel measure. In it was placed,till it was quite full, a bunch of white chrysanthemums, in appearancelike crystal balls. In the middle of the west wall, was suspended alarge picture representing vapor and rain; the handiwork of MiNang-yang. On the left and right of this picture was hung a pair ofantithetical scrolls--the autograph of Yen Lue. The lines on thesescrolls were:
  Wild scenes are to the taste of those who leisure love,  And springs and rookeries are their rustic resort.
On the table, figured a large tripod. On the left, stood on a blackwoodcabinet, a huge bowl from a renowned government kiln. This bowlcontained about ten "Buddha's hands" of beautiful yellow and fineproportions. On the right, was suspended, on a Japanese-lacquered frame,a white jade sonorous plate. Its shape resembled two eyes, one by theside of the other. Next to it hung a small hammer.
Pan Erh had become a little more confident and was about to seize thehammer and beat the plate, when the waiting-maids hastened to preventhim. Next, he wanted a "Buddha's hand" to eat. T'an Ch'un chose one andlet him have it. "You may play with it," she said, "but you can't eatit."
On the east side stood a sleeping divan. On a movable bed was hung aleek-green gauze curtain, ornamented with double embroideries,representing flowers, plants and insects. Pan Erh ran up to have a look."This is a green-cicada," he shouted; "this a grasshopper!"
But old goody Liu promptly gave him a slap. "You mean scamp!" she cried."What an awful rumpus you're kicking up! I simply brought you along withme to look at things; and lo, you put on airs;" and she beat Pan Erhuntil he burst out crying. It was only after every one quickly combinedin using their efforts to solace him that he at length desisted.
Old lady Chia then looked through the gauze casement into the back courtfor some time. "The dryandra trees by the eaves of the covered passageare growing all right," she remarked. "The only thing is that theirfoliage is rather sparse."
But while she passed this remark, a sudden gust of wind swept by, andfaintly on her ear fell the strains of music. "In whose house is there awedding?" old lady Chia inquired. "This place must be very near thestreet!"
"How could one hear what's going on in the street?" Madame Wang and theothers smiled. "It's our twelve girls practising on their wind andstring instruments!"
"As they're practising," dowager lady Chia eagerly cried, smilingly,"why not ask them to come in here and practise? They'll be able to havea stroll also, while we, on our part, will derive some enjoyment."
Upon hearing this suggestion, lady Feng immediately directed a servantto go out and call them in. She further issued orders to bring a tableand spread a red cover over it.
"Let it be put," old lady Chia chimed in, "in the water-pavilion of theLotus Fragrance Arbour, for (the music) will borrow the ripple of thestream and sound ever so much more pleasant to the ear. We can by andbye drink our wine in the Cho Chin Hall; we'll thus have ample room, andbe able to listen from close!"
Every one admitted that the spot was well adapted. Dowager lady Chiaturned herself towards Mrs. Hsueeh. "Let's get ahead!" she laughed. "Theyoung ladies don't like any one to come in here, for fear lest theirquarters should get contaminated; so don't let us show ourselvesdisregardful of their wishes! The right thing would be to go and haveour wine aboard one of those boats!"
As she spoke, one and all rose to their feet. They were making their wayout when T'an Ch'un interposed. "What's this that you're saying?" shesmiled. "Please do seat yourselves, venerable senior, and you, Mrs.Hsueeh, and Madame Wang! You can't be going yet?"
"These three girls of mine are really nice! There are only twomistresses that are simply dreadful." Dowager lady Chia said smilingly."When we get drunk shortly, we'll go and sit in their rooms and have alark!"
These words evoked laughter from every one. In a body they quitted theplace. But they had not proceeded far before they reached the bankcovered with aquatic plants, to which place the boat-women, who had beenbrought from Ku Su, had already punted two crab-wood boats. Into one ofthese boats, they helped old lady Chia, Madame Wang, Mrs. Hsueeh, oldgoody Liu, Yuean Yang, and Yue Ch'uan-Erh. Last in order Li Wan followedon board. But lady Feng too stepped in, and standing up on the bow, sheinsisted upon punting.
Dowager lady Chia, however, remonstrated from her seat in the bottom ofthe boat. "This isn't a joke," she cried, "we're not on the river, it'strue, but there are some very deep places about, so be quick and comein. Do it for my sake."
"What's there to be afraid of?" lady Feng laughed. "Compose your mind,worthy ancestor."
Saying this, the boat was pushed off with one shove. When it reached themiddle of the lake, lady Feng became nervous, for the craft was smalland the occupants many, and hastily handing the pole to a boatwoman, shesquatted down at last.
Ying Ch'un, her sisters, their cousins, as well as Pao-yue subsequentlygot on board the second boat, and followed in their track; while therest of the company, consisting of old nurses and a bevy ofwaiting-maids, kept pace with them along the bank of the stream.
"All these broken lotus leaves are dreadful!" Pao-yue shouted. "Why don'tyou yet tell the servants to pull them off?"
"When was this garden left quiet during all the days of this year?"Pao-ch'ai smiled. "Why, people have come, day after day, to visit it, sowas there ever any time to tell the servants to come and clean it?"
"I have the greatest abhorrence," Lin Tai-yue chimed in, "for Li I'spoetical works, but there's only this line in them which I like:
 "'Leave the dry lotus leaves so as to hear the patter of the rain.'
"and here you people deliberately mean again not to leave the dry lotusstay where they are."
"This is indeed a fine line!" Pao-yue exclaimed. "We mustn't hereafterlet them pull them away!"
While this conversation continued, they reached the shoaly inlet underthe flower-laden beech. They felt a coolness from the shady overgrowthpenetrate their very bones. The decaying vegetation and the witheredaquatic chestnut plants on the sand-bank enhanced, to a greater degree,the beauty of the autumn scenery.
Dowager lady Chia at this point observed some spotless rooms on thebank, so spick and so span. "Are not these Miss Hsueeh's quarters," sheasked. "Eh?"
"Yes, they are!" everybody answered.
Old lady Chia promptly bade them go alongside, and wending their way upthe marble steps, which seemed to lead to the clouds, they in a bodyentered the Heng Wu court. Here they felt a peculiar perfume comewafting into their nostrils, for the colder the season got the greenergrew that strange vegetation, and those fairy-like creepers. The variousplants were laden with seeds, which closely resembled red coral beans,as they drooped in lovely clusters.
The house, as soon as they put their foot into it, presented the aspectof a snow cave. There was a total absence of every object of ornament.On the table figured merely an earthenware vase, in which were placedseveral chrysanthemums. A few books and teacups were also conspicuous,but no further knicknacks. On the bed was suspended a green gauzecurtain, and of equally extreme plainness were the coverlets andmattresses belonging to it.
"This child," dowager lady Chia sighed, "is too simple! If you've gotnothing to lay about, why not ask your aunt for a few articles? I wouldnever raise any objection. I never thought about them. Your things, ofcourse, have been left at home, and have not been brought over."
So saying, she told Yuan Yang to go and fetch several bric-a-brac. Shenext went on to call lady Feng to task.
"She herself wouldn't have them," (lady Feng) rejoined. "We really sentover a few, but she refused every one of them and returned them."
"In her home also," smiled Mrs. Hsueeh, "she does not go in very much forsuch sort of things."
Old lady Chia nodded her head. "It will never do!" she added. "It does,it's true, save trouble; but were some relative to come on a visit,she'll find things in an impossible way. In the second place, suchsimplicity in the apartments of young ladies of tender age is quiteunpropitious! Why, if you young people go on in this way, we old fogiesshould go further and live in stables! You've all heard what is said inthose books and plays about the dreadful luxury, with which youngladies' quarters are got up. And though these girls of ours could notpresume to place themselves on the same footing as those young ladies,they shouldn't nevertheless exceed too much the bounds of whatconstitutes the right thing. If they have any objects ready at hand, whyshouldn't they lay them out? And if they have any strong predilectionfor simplicity, a few things less will do quite as well. I've always hadthe greatest knack for titifying a room, but being an old woman now Ihaven't the ease and inclination to attend to such things! These girlsare, however, learning how to do things very nicely. I was afraid thatthere would be an appearance of vulgarity in what they did, and that,even had they anything worth having, they'd so place them about as tospoil them; but from what I can see there's nothing vulgar about them.But let me now put things right for you, and I'll wager that everythingwill look grand as well as plain. I've got a couple of my ownknicknacks, which I've managed to keep to this day, by not allowingPao-yue to get a glimpse of them; for had he ever seen them, they toowould have long ago disappeared!" Continuing, she called Yuean Yang."Fetch that marble pot with scenery on it," she said to her; "that gauzescreen, and that tripod of transparent stone with black streaks, whichyou'll find in there, and lay out all three on this table. They'll beample! Bring likewise those ink pictures and white silk curtains, andchange these curtains."
Yuean Yang expressed her obedience. "All these articles have been putaway in the eastern loft," she smiled. "In what boxes they've been put,I couldn't tell; I must therefore go and find them quietly and if Ibring them over to-morrow, it will be time enough."
"To-morrow or the day after will do very well; but don't forget, that'sall," dowager lady Chia urged.
While conversing, they sat for a while. Presently, they left the roomsand repaired straightway into the Cho Chin hall. Wen Kuan and the othergirls came up and paid their obeisance. They next inquired what songsthey were to practise.
"You'd better choose a few pieces to rehearse out of those you knowbest," old lady Chia rejoined.
Wen Kuan and her companions then withdrew and betook themselves to theLotus Fragrance Pavilion. But we will leave them there without furtherallusion to them.
During this while, lady Feng had already, with the help of servants, goteverything in perfect order. On the left and right of the side of honourwere placed two divans. These divans were completely covered withembroidered covers and fine variegated mats. In front of each divanstood two lacquer teapoys, inlaid, some with designs of crab-appleflowers; others of plum blossom, some of lotus leaves, others ofsun-flowers. Some of these teapoys were square, others round. Theirshapes were all different. On each was placed a set consisting of astove and a bottle, also a box with partitions. The two divans and fourteapoys, in the place of honour, were used by dowager lady Chia and Mrs.Hsueeh. The chair and two teapoys in the next best place, by Madame Wang.The rest of the inmates had, all alike, a chair and a teapoy. On theeast side sat old goody Liu. Below old goody Liu came Madame Wang. Onthe west was seated Shih Hsiang-yuen. The second place was occupied byPao-ch'ai; the third by Tai-yue; the fourth by Ying Ch'un. T'an Ch'un andHsi Ch'un filled the lower seats, in their proper order; Pao-yue sat inthe last place. The two teapoys assigned to Li Wan and lady Feng stoodwithin the third line of railings, and beyond the second row of gauzeframes. The pattern of the partition-boxes corresponded likewise withthe pattern on the teapoys. Each inmate had a black decanter, withsilver, inlaid in foreign designs; as well as an ornamented, enamelledcup.
After they had all occupied the seats assigned to them, dowager ladyChia took the initiative and smilingly suggested: "Let's begin bydrinking a couple of cups of wine. But we should also have a game offorfeits to-day, we'll have plenty of fun then."
"You, venerable senior, must certainly have a good wine order toimpose," Mrs. Hsueeh laughingly observed, "but how could we ever complywith it? But if your aim be to intoxicate us, why, we'll all straightwaydrink one or two cups more than is good for us and finish!"
"Here's Mrs. Hsueeh beginning to be modest again to-day!" old lady Chiasmiled. "But I expect it's because she looks down upon me as being anold hag!"
"It isn't modesty!" Mrs. Hsueeh replied smiling. "It's all a dread lest Ishouldn't be able to observe the order and thus incur ridicule."
"If you don't give the right answer," Madame Wang promptly interposedwith a smile, "you'll only have to drink a cup or two more of wine, andshould we get drunk, we can go to sleep; and who'll, pray laugh at us?"
Mrs. Hsueeh nodded her head. "I'll agree to the order," she laughed,"but, dear senior, you must, after all, do the right thing and have acup of wine to start it."
"This is quite natural!" old lady Chia answered laughingly; and withthese words, she forthwith emptied a cup.
Lady Feng with hurried steps advanced to the centre of the room. "If weare to play at forfeits," she smilingly proposed, "we'd better invitesister Yuean Yang to come and join us."
The whole company was perfectly aware that if dowager lady Chia had togive out the rule of forfeits, Yuean Yang would necessarily have tosuggest it, so the moment they heard the proposal they, with commonconsent, approved it as excellent. Lady Feng therefore there and thendragged Yuean Yang over.
"As you're to take a part in the game of forfeits," Madame Wangsmilingly observed, "there's no reason why you should stand up." Andturning her head round, "Bring over," she bade a young waiting-maid, "achair and place it at your Mistress Secunda's table."
Yuean Yang, half refusing and half assenting, expressed her thanks, andtook the seat. After partaking also of a cup of wine, "Drinking rules,"she smiled, "resemble very much martial law; so irrespective of high orlow, I alone will preside. Any one therefore who disobeys my words willhave to suffer a penalty."
"Of course, it should be so!" Madame Wang and the others laughed, "so bequick and give out the rule!"
But before Yuean Yang had as yet opened her lips to speak, old goody Liuleft the table, and waving her hand: "Don't," she said, "make fun ofpeople in this way, for I'll go home."
"This will never do!" One and all smilingly protested.
Yuean Yang shouted to the young waiting-maids to drag her back to hertable; and the maids, while also indulging in laughter, actually pulledher and compelled her to rejoin the banquet.
"Spare me!" old goody Liu kept on crying, "spare me!"
"Any one who says one word more," Yuean Yang exclaimed, "will be fined awhole decanter full."
Old goody Liu then at length observed silence.
"I'll now give out the set of dominoes." Yuean Yang proceeded. "I'llbegin from our venerable mistress and follow down in proper order untilI come to old goody Liu, when I shall stop. So as to illustrate what Imeant just now by giving out a set, I'll take these three dominoes andplace them apart; you have to begin by saying something on the first,next, to allude to the second, and, after finishing with all three, totake the name of the whole set and match it with a line, no matterwhether it be from some stanza or roundelay, song or idyl, set phrasesor proverbs. But they must rhyme. And any one making a mistake will bemulcted in one cup."
"This rule is splendid; begin at once!" they all exclaimed.
"I've got a set," Yuean Yang pursued; "on the left, is the piece'heaven,' (twelve dots)."
  "Above head stretches the blue heaven,"
dowager lady Chia said.
"Good!" shouted every one.
"In the centre is a five and six," Yuean Yang resumed.
  The fragrance of the plum blossom pierces the bones on the bridge      "Six,"
old lady Chia added.
"There now remains," Yuean Yang explained, "one piece, the six and one."
  "From among the fleecy clouds issues the wheel-like russet sun."
dowager lady Chia continued.
"The whole combined," Yuan Yang observed "forms 'the devil withdishevelled hair.'"
  "This devil clasps the leg of the 'Chung Pa' devil,"
old lady Chia observed.
At the conclusion of her recitation, they all burst out laughing."Capital!" they shouted. Old lady Chia drained a cup. Yuean Yang thenwent on to remark, "I've got another set; the one on the left is adouble five."
  "Bud after bud of the plum bloom dances in the wind,"
Mrs. Hsueeh replied.
"The one on the right is a ten spot," Yuean Yang pursued.
  "In the tenth moon the plum bloom on the hills emits its fragrant      smell,"
Mrs. Hsueeh added.
"The middle piece is the two and five, making the 'unlike seven;'" YueanYang observed.
  "The 'spinning damsel' star meets the 'cow-herd' on the eve of the      seventh day of the seventh moon,"
Miss Hsueeh said.
"Together they form: 'Erh Lang strolls on the five mounds;'" Yuean Yangcontinued.
  "Mortals cannot be happy as immortals,"
Mrs. Hsueeh rejoined.
Her answers over, the whole company extolled them and had a drink. "I'vegot another set!" Yuean Yang once more exclaimed. "On the left, aredistinctly the distant dots of the double ace."
  "Both sun and moon are so suspended as to shine on heaven and earth,"
Hsiang-yuen ventured.
"On the right, are a couple of spots, far apart, which clearly form aone and one." Yuean Yang pursued.
  "What time a lonesome flower falls to the ground, no sound is      audible,"
Hsiang-yuen rejoined.
"In the middle, there is the one and four," Yuean Yang added.
  "The red apricot tree is planted by the sun, and leans against the      clouds;"
Hsiang-yuen answered.
"Together they form the 'cherry fruit ripens for the ninth time,'" YueanYang said.
  "In the imperial garden it is pecked by birds."
Hsiang-yuen replied.
When she had done with her part, she drank a cup of wine. "I've gotanother set," Yuean Yang began, "the one on the left is a double three."
  "The swallows, pair by pair, chatter on the beams;"
Pao-ch'ai remarked.
"The right piece is a six," Yuean Yang added.
  "The marsh flower is stretched by the breeze e'en to the length of a      green sash,"
Pao-ch'ai returned.
"The centre piece is a three and six, making a nine spot," Yuean Yangpursued.
  "The three hills tower half beyond the azure skies;"
Pao-ch'ai rejoined.
"Lumped together they form: a 'chain-bound solitary boat,'" Yuean Yangresumed.
  "Where there are wind and waves, there I feel sad;"
Pao-ch'ai answered.
When she had finished her turn and drained her cup, Yuean Yang went onagain. "On the left," she said, "there's a 'heaven.'"
  "A morning fine and beauteous scenery, but, alas, what a day for me!"
Tai-yue replied.
When this line fell on Pao-chai's ear, she turned her head round andcast a glance at her, but Tai-yue was so nervous lest she should have topay a forfeit that she did not so much as notice her.
"In the middle there's the 'colour of the embroidered screen, (tenspots, four and six), is beautiful,'" Yuean Yang proceeded.
  "Not e'en Hung Niang to the gauze window comes, any message to bring."
Tai-yue responded.
"There now remains a two and six, eight in all," Yuean Yang resumed.
  "Twice see the jady throne when led in to perform the court ritual,"
Tai-yue replied.
"Together they form 'a basket suitable for putting plucked flowers in,'"Yuean Yang continued.
  "The fairy wand smells nice as on it hangs a peony."
Tai-yue retorted.
At the close of her replies, she took a sip of wine. Yuean Yang thenresumed. "On the left," she said, "there's a four and five, making a'different-combined nine.'"
  "The peach blossoms bear heavy drops of rain;"
Ying Ch'un remarked.
The company laughed. "She must be fined!" they exclaimed. "She has madea mistake in the rhyme. Besides, it isn't right!"
Ying Ch'un smiled and drank a sip. The fact is that both lady Feng andYuean Yang were so eager to hear the funny things that would be utteredby old goody Liu, that they with one voice purposely ruled that everyone answered wrong and fined them. When it came to Madame Wang's turn,Yuean Yang recited something for her. Next followed old goody Liu.
"When we country-people have got nothing to do," old goody Liu said, "afew of us too often come together and play this sort of game; but theanswers we give are not so high-flown; yet, as I can't get out of it,I'll likewise make a try!"
"It's easy enough to say what there is," one and all laughed, "so justyou go on and don't mind!"
"On the left," Yuean Yang smiled, "there's a double four, i.e. 'man.'"
Goody Liu listened intently. After considerable reflection,
  "It's a peasant!"
she cried.
One and all in the room blurted out laughing.
"Well-said!" dowager lady Chia observed with a laugh, "that's the way."
"All we country-people know," old goody Liu proceeded, also laughing,"is just what comes within our own rough-and-ready wits, so young ladiesand ladies pray don't poke fun at me!"
"In the centre there's the three and four, green matched with red," YueanYang pursued.
  "The large fire burnt the hairy caterpillar;"
old goody Liu ventured.
"This will do very well!", the party laughed, "go on with what is inyour line."
"On the right," Yuean Yang smilingly continued, "there's a one and four,and is really pretty."
  "A turnip and a head of garlic."
old goody Liu answered.
This reply evoked further laughter from the whole company.
"Altogether, it's a twig of flowers," Yuean Yang added laughing.
  "The flower dropped, and a huge melon formed."
old goody Liu observed, while gesticulating with both her hands by wayof illustration.
The party once more exploded in loud merriment.
But, reader, if you entertain any curiosity to hear what else was saidduring the banquet, listen to the explanation given in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XLI.
  Chia Pao-yue tastes tea in the Lung Ts'ui monastery.  Old goody Liu gets drunk and falls asleep in the I Hung court.
Old goody Liu, so the story goes, exclaimed, while making signs withboth hands,
  "The flower dropped and a huge melon formed;"
to the intense amusement of all the inmates, who burst into a boisterousfit of laughter. In due course, however, she drank the closing cup. Thenshe made another effort to evoke merriment. "To speak the truth to-day,"she smilingly observed, "my hands and my feet are so rough, and I've hadso much wine that I must be careful; or else I might, by a slip of thehand, break the porcelain cups. If you have got any wooden cups, you'dbetter produce them. It wouldn't matter then if even they were to slipout of my hands and drop on the ground!"
This joke excited some more mirth. But lady Feng, upon hearing thisspeedily put on a smile. "Well," she said, "if you really want a woodenone, I'll fetch you one at once! But there's just one word I'd like totell you beforehand. Wooden cups are not like porcelain ones. They go insets; so you'll have to do the right thing and drink from every cup ofthe set."
"I just now simply spoke in jest about those cups in order to inducethem to laugh," old goody Liu at these words, mused within herself,"but, who would have thought that she actually has some of the kind.I've often been to the large households of village gentry on a visit,and even been to banquets there and seen both gold cups and silver cups;but never have I beheld any wooden ones about! Ah, of course! They must,I expect, be the wooden bowls used by the young children. Their objectmust be to inveigle me to have a couple of bowlfuls more than is goodfor me! But I don't mind it. This wine is, verily, like honey, so if Idrink a little more, it won't do me any harm."
Bringing this train of thought to a close, "Fetch them!" she said aloud."We'll talk about them by and bye."
Lady Feng then directed Feng Erh to go and bring the set of ten cups,made of bamboo roots, from the book-case in the front inner room. Uponhearing her orders, Feng Erh was about to go and execute them, when YueanYang smilingly interposed. "I know those ten cups of yours," sheremarked, "they're small. What's more, a while back you mentioned woodenones, and if you have bamboo ones brought now, it won't look well; sowe'd better get from our place that set of ten large cups, scooped outof whole blocks of aspen roots, and pour the contents of all ten of themdown her throat?"
"Yes, that would be much better," lady Feng smiled.
The cups were then actually brought by a servant, at the direction ofYuean Yang. At the sight of them, old goody Liu was filled with surpriseas well as with admiration. Surprise, as the ten formed one set going ingradation from large to small; the largest being amply of the size of asmall basin, the smallest even measuring two of those she held in herhand. Admiration, as they were all alike, engraved, in perfect style,with scenery, trees, and human beings, and bore inscriptions in the'grass' character as well as the seal of the writer.
"It will be enough," she consequently shouted with alacrity, "if yougive me that small one."
"There's no one," lady Feng laughingly insinuated, "with the capacity totackle these! Hence it is that not a soul can pluck up courage enough touse them! But as you, old dame, asked for them, and they were fishedout, after ever so much trouble, you're bound to do the proper thing anddrink out of each, one after the other."
Old goody Liu was quite taken aback. "I daren't!" she promptly demurred."My dear lady, do let me off!"
Dowager lady Chia, Mrs. Hsueeh and Madame Wang were quite alive to thefact that a person advanced in years as she was could not be gifted withsuch powers of endurance, and they hastened to smilingly expostulate."To speak is to speak, and a joke is a joke, but she mayn't take toomuch," they said; "let her just empty this first cup, and have done."
"O-mi-to-fu!" ejaculated old goody Liu. "I'll only have a small cupful,and put this huge fellow away, and take it home and drink at myleisure."
At this remark, the whole company once more gave way to laughter. YueanYang had no alternative but to give in and she had to bid a servant filla large cup full of wine. Old goody Liu laid hold of it with both handsand raised it to her mouth.
"Gently a bit!" old lady Chia and Mrs. Hsueeh shouted. "Mind you don'tchoke!"
Mrs. Hsueeh then told lady Feng to put some viands before her. "GoodyLiu!" smiled lady Feng, "tell me the name of anything you fancy, andI'll bring it and feed you."
"What names can I know?" old goody Liu rejoined. "Everything is good!"
"Bring some egg-plant and salt-fish for her!" dowager lady Chiasuggested with a smile.
Lady Feng, upon hearing this suggestion, complied with it by catchingsome egg-plant and salt-fish with two chopsticks and putting them intoold goody Liu's mouth. "You people," she smiled, "daily feed onegg-plants; so taste these of ours and see whether they've been nicelyprepared or not."
"Don't be making a fool of me!" old goody Liu answered smilingly. "Ifegg-plants can have such flavour, we ourselves needn't sow any cereals,but confine ourselves to growing nothing but egg-plants!"
"They're really egg-plants!" one and all protested. "She's not pullingyour leg!"
Old goody Liu was amazed. "If these be actually egg-plants," she said,"I've uselessly eaten them so long! But, my lady, do give me a few more;I'd like to taste the next mouthful carefully!"
Lady Feng brought her, in very deed, another lot, and put it in hermouth. Old goody Liu munched for long with particular care. "There is,it's true, something about them of the flavour of egg-plant," shelaughingly remarked, "yet they don't quite taste like egg-plants. Buttell me how they're cooked, so that I may prepare them in the same wayfor myself."
"There's nothing hard about it!" lady Feng answered smiling. "You takethe newly cut egg-plants and pare the skin off. All you want then issome fresh meat. You hash it into fine mince, and fry it in chicken fat.Then you take some dry chicken meat, and mix it with mushrooms, newbamboo shoots, sweet mushrooms, dry beancurd paste, flavoured with fivespices, and every kind of dry fruits, and you chop the whole lot intofine pieces. You then bake all these things in chicken broth, until it'sabsorbed, when you fry them, to finish, in sweet oil, and adding someoil, made of the grains of wine, you place them in a porcelain jar, andclose it hermetically. At any time that you want any to eat, all youhave to do is to take out some, and mix it with some roasted chicken,and there it is all ready."
Old goody Liu a shook her head and put out her tongue. "My Buddha'sancestor!" she shouted. "One wants about ten chickens to prepare thisdish! It isn't strange then that it has this flavour!"
Saying this, she quietly finished her wine. But still she kept onminutely scrutinizing the cup.
"Haven't you yet had enough to satisfy you?" lady Feng smiled. "If youhaven't, well, then drink another cup."
"Dreadful!" eagerly exclaimed old goody Liu. "I shall be soon getting sodrunk that it will be the very death of me. I was only looking at it asI admire pretty things like this! But what a trouble it must have costto turn out!"
"Have you done with your wine?" Yuan Yang laughingly inquired. "But,after all, what kind of wood is this cup made of?"
"It isn't to be wondered at," old goody Liu smiled, "that you can't makeit out Miss! How ever could you people, who live inside golden doors andembroidered apartments, know anything of wood! We have the whole daylong the trees in the woods as our neighbours. When weary, we use themas our pillows and go to sleep on them. When exhausted, we sit with ourbacks leaning against them. When, in years of dearth, we feel the pangsof hunger, we also feed on them. Day after day, we see them with oureyes; day after day we listen to them with our ears; day after day, wetalk of them with our mouths. I am therefore well able to tell whetherany wood be good or bad, genuine or false. Do let me then see what itis!"
As she spoke, she intently scanned the cup for a considerable length oftime. "Such a family as yours," she then said, "could on no account ownmean things! Any wood that is easily procured, wouldn't even find aplace in here. This feels so heavy, as I weigh it in my hands, that ifit isn't aspen, it must, for a certainty, be yellow cedar."
Her rejoinder amused every one in the room. But they then perceived anold matron come up. After asking permission of dowager lady Chia tospeak: "The young ladies," she said, "have got to the Lotus Fragrancepavilion, and they request your commands, as to whether they shouldstart with the rehearsal at once or tarry a while."
"I forgot all about them!" old lady Chia promptly cried with a smile."Tell them to begin rehearsing at once!"
The matron expressed her obedience and walked away. Presently, becameaudible the notes of the pan-pipe and double flute, now soft, now loud,and the blended accents of the pipe and fife. So balmy did the breezehappen to be and the weather so fine that the strains of music camewafted across the arbours and over the stream, and, needless to say,conduced to exhilarate their spirits and to cheer their hearts. Unableto resist the temptation, Pao-yue was the first to snatch a decanter andto fill a cup for himself. He quaffed it with one breath. Then pouringanother cup, he was about to drain it, when he noticed that Madame Wangtoo was anxious for a drink, and that she bade a servant bring a warmsupply of wine. "With alacrity, Pao-yue crossed over to her, and,presenting his own cup, he applied it to Madame Wang's lips. His motherdrank two sips while he held it in his hands, but on the arrival of thewarm wine, Pao-yue resumed his seat. Madame Wang laid hold of the warmdecanter, and left the table, while the whole party quitted their placesat the banquet; and Mrs. Hsueeh too rose to her feet.
"Take over that decanter from her," dowager lady Chia promptly shoutedto Li Wan and lady Feng, "and press your aunt into a seat. We shall allthen feel at ease!"
Hearing this, Madame Wang surrendered the decanter to lady Feng andreturned to her seat.
"Let's all have a couple of cups of wine!" old lady Chia laughinglycried. "It's capital fun to-day!"
With this proposal, she laid hold of a cup and offered it to Mrs. Hsueeh.Turning also towards Hsiang-yuen and Pao-ch'ai: "You two cousins!" sheadded, "must also have a cup. Your cousin Lin can't take much wine, buteven she mustn't be let off."
While pressing them, she drained her cup. Hsiang-yuen, Pao-ch'ai andTai-y ue then had their drink. But about this time old goody Liu caughtthe strains of music, and, being already under the influence of liquor,her spirits became more and more exuberant, and she began to gesticulateand skip about. Her pranks amused Pao-yue to such a degree that leavingthe table, he crossed over to where Tai-yue was seated and observedlaughingly: "Just you look at the way old goody Liu is going on!"
"In days of yore," Tai-yue smiled, "every species of animal commenced todance the moment the sounds of music broke forth. She's like a buffalonow."
This simile made her cousins laugh. But shortly the music ceased. "We'veall had our wine," Mrs. Hsueeh smilingly proposed, "so let's go andstroll about for a time; we can after that sit down again!"
Dowager lady Chia herself was at the moment feeling a strong inclinationto have a ramble. In due course, therefore, they all left the banquetand went with their old senior, for a walk. Dowager lady Chia, however,longed to take goody Liu along with her to help her dispel her ennui, sopromptly seizing the old dame's hand in hers, they threaded their way asfar as the trees, which stood facing the hill. After lolling about withher for a few minutes, "What kind of tree is this?" she went on toinquire of her. "What kind of stone is this? What species of flower isthat?"
Old goody Liu gave suitable reply to each of her questions. "Who'd everhave imagined it," she proceeded to tell dowager lady Chia; "not onlyare the human beings in the city grand, but even the birds are grand.Why, the moment these birds fly into your mansion, they also becomebeautiful things, and acquire the gift of speech as well!"
The company could not make out the drift of her observations. "Whatbirds get transformed into beautiful things and become able to speak?"they felt impelled to ask.
"Those perched on those gold stands, under the verandah, with greenplumage and red beaks are parrots. I know them well enough!" Goody Liureplied. "But those old black crows in the cages there have crests likephoenixes! They can talk too!"
One and all laughed. But not long elapsed before they caught sight ofseveral waiting-maids, who came to invite them to a collation.
"After the number of cups of wine I've had," old lady Chia said, "Idon't feel hungry. But never mind, bring the things here. We can nibblesomething at our leisure."
The maids speedily went off and fetched two teapoys; but they alsobrought a couple of small boxes with partitions. When they came to beopened and to be examined, the contents of each were found to consist oftwo kinds of viands. In the one, were two sorts of steamed eatables. Oneof these was a sweet cake, made of lotus powder, scented withsun-flower. The other being rolls with goose fat and fir cone seeds. Thesecond box contained two kinds of fried eatables; one of which was smalldumplings, about an inch in size.
"What stuffing have they put in them?" dowager lady Chia asked.
"They're with crabs inside," 'hastily rejoined the matrons.
Their old mistress, at this reply, knitted her eyebrows. "These fat,greasy viands for such a time!" she observed. "Who'll ever eat thesethings?"
But finding, when she came to inspect the other kind, that it consistedof small fruits of flour, fashioned in every shape, and fried in butter,she did not fancy these either. She then however pressed Mrs. Hsueeh tohave something to eat, but Mrs. Hsueeh merely took a piece of cake, whiledowager lady Chia helped herself to a roll; but after tasting a bit, shegave the remaining half to a servant girl.
Goody Liu saw how beautifully worked those small flour fruits were, madeas they were in various colours and designs, and she took, after pickingand choosing, one which looked like a peony. "The most ingenious girlsin our village could not, even with a pair of scissors, cut out anythinglike this in paper!" she exclaimed. "I would like to eat it, but I can'tmake up my mind to! I had better pack up a few and take them home andgive them to them as specimens!"
Her remarks amused every one.
"When you start for home," dowager lady Chia said, "I'll give you awhole porcelain jar full of them; so you may as well eat these first,while they are hot!"
The rest of the inmates selected such of the fruits as took their fancy,but after they had helped themselves to one or two, they felt satisfied.Goody Liu, however, had never before touched such delicacies. Thesewere, in addition, made small, dainty, and without the least semblanceof clumsiness, so when she and Pan Erh had served themselves to a few ofeach sort, half the contents of the dish vanished. But what remained ofthem were then, at the instance of lady Feng, put into two plates, andsent, together with a partition-box, to Wen Kuan and the other singinggirls as their share.
At an unexpected moment, they perceived the nurse come in with TaChieh-erh in her arms, and they all induced her to have a romp with themfor a time. But while Ta Chieh-erh was holding a large pumelo andamusing herself with it, she casually caught sight of Pan Erh with a'Buddha's hand.' Ta Chieh would have it. A servant-girl endeavoured tocoax (Pan-Erh) to surrender it to her, but Ta Chieh-erh, unable to curbher impatience, burst out crying. It was only after the pumelo had beengiven to Pan-Erh, and that the 'Buddha's hand' had, by dint of muchhumouring, been got from Pan Erh and given to her, that she stoppedcrying.
Pan Erh had played quite long enough with the 'Buddha's hand,' and had,at the moment, his two hands laden with fruits, which he was in thecourse of eating. When he suddenly besides saw how scented and round thepumelo was, the idea dawned on him that it was more handy for play, and,using it as a ball, he kicked it along and went off to have some fun,relinquishing at once every thought of the 'Buddha's hand.'
By this time dowager lady Chia and the other members had had tea, soleading off again goody Liu, they threaded their way to the Lung Ts'uimonastery. Miao Yue hastened to usher them in. On their arrival in theinterior of the court, they saw the flowers and trees in luxuriantblossom.
"Really," smiled old lady Chia, "it's those people, who devotethemselves to an ascetic life and have nothing to do, who manage, byconstant repairs, to make their places much nicer than those of others!"
As she spoke, she wended her steps towards the Eastern hall. Miao Yue,with a face beaming with smiles, made way for her to walk in. "We'vejust been filling ourselves with wines and meats," dowager lady Chiaobserved, "and with the josses you've got in here, we shall be guilty ofprofanity. We'd better therefore sit here! But give us some of that goodtea of yours; and we'll get off so soon as we have had a cup of it."
Pao-yue watched Miao Yue's movements intently, when he noticed her layhold of a small tea-tray, fashioned in the shape of a peony, made of redcarved lacquer, and inlaid with designs in gold representing a dragonensconced in the clouds with the character 'longevity' clasped in itsjaws, a tray, which contained a small multicoloured cup with cover,fabricated at the 'Ch'eng' Kiln, and present it to his grandmother.
"I don't care for 'Liu An' tea!" old lady Chia exclaimed.
"I know it; but this is old 'Chuen Mei,'" Miao Yue answered with a smile.
Dowager lady Chia received the cup. "What water is this?" she went on toinquire.
"It's rain water collected last year;" Miao Yue added by way of reply.
Old lady Chia readily drank half a cup of the tea; and smiling, sheproffered it to goody Liu. "Just you taste this tea!" she said.
Goody Liu drained the remainder with one draught. "It's good, ofcourse," she remarked laughingly, "but it's rather weak! It would be farbetter were it brewed a little stronger!"
Dowager lady Chia and all the inmates laughed. But subsequently, each ofthem was handed a thin, pure white covered cup, all of the same make,originating from the 'Kuan' kiln. Miao Yue, however, soon gave a tug atPao-ch'ai's and Tai-yue's lapels, and both quitted the apartment alongwith her. But Pao-yue too quietly followed at their heels. Spying Miao Yueshow his two cousins into a side-room, Pao-ch'ai take a seat in thecourt, Tai-yue seat herself on Miao Yue's rush mat, and Miao Yue herselfapproach a stove, fan the fire and boil some water, with which shebrewed another pot of tea, Pao-yue walked in. "Are you bent upon drinkingyour own private tea?" he smiled.
"Here you rush again to steal our tea," the two girls laughed with oneaccord. "There's none for you!"
But just as Miao Yue was going to fetch a cup, she perceived an oldtaoist matron bring away the tea things, which had been used in theupper rooms. "Don't put that 'Ch'eng' kiln tea-cup by!" Miao Yue hastilyshouted. "Go and put it outside!"
Pao-yue understood that it must be because old goody Liu had drunk out ofit that she considered it too dirty to keep. He then saw Miao Yue producetwo other cups. The one had an ear on the side. On the bowl itself wereengraved in three characters: 'calabash cup,' in the plain 'square'writing. After these, followed a row of small characters in the 'true'style, to the effect that the cup had been an article much treasured byWang K'ai. Next came a second row of small characters stating: 'that inthe course of the fourth moon of the fifth year of Yuan Feng, of theSung dynasty, Su Shih of Mei Shan had seen it in the 'Secret' palace.
This cup, Miao Yue filled, and handed to Pao-ch'ai.
The other cup was, in appearance, as clumsy as it was small; yet on itfigured an engraved inscription, consisting of 'spotted rhinoceros cup,'in three 'seal' characters, which bore the semblance of pendent pearls.Miao Yue replenished this cup and gave it to Tai-yue; and taking the greenjade cup, which she had, on previous occasions, often used for her owntea, she filled it and presented it to Pao-yue.
"'The rules observed in the world,' the adage says, 'must beimpartial,'" Pao-yue smiled. "But while my two cousins are handling thoseantique and rare gems, here am I with this coarse object!"
"Is this a coarse thing?" Miao Yue exclaimed. "Why, I'm making nooutrageous statement when I say that I'm inclined to think that it is byno means certain that you could lay your hand upon any such coarse thingas this in your home!"
"'Do in the country as country people do,' the proverb says," Pao-yuelaughingly rejoined. "So when one gets in a place like this of yours,one must naturally look down upon every thing in the way of gold,pearls, jade and precious stones, as coarse rubbish!"
This sentiment highly delighted Miao Yue. So much so, that producinganother capacious cup, carved out of a whole bamboo root, which with itsnine curves and ten rings, with twenty knots in each ring, resembled acoiled dragon, "Here," she said with a face beaming with smiles, "thereonly remains this one! Can you manage this large cup?"
"I can!" Pao-yue vehemently replied, with high glee.
"Albeit you have the stomach to tackle all it holds," Miao Yue laughed,"I haven't got so much tea for you to waste! Have you not heard how thatthe first cup is the 'taste'-cup; the second 'the stupid-thing-for-quenching-one's-thirst,' and the third 'the drink-mule' cup? But wereyou now to go in for this huge cup, why what more wouldn't that be?"
At these words, Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yue and Pao-yue simultaneously indulged inlaughter. But Miao-yue seized the teapot, and poured well-nigh a wholecupful of tea into the big cup. Pao-yue tasted some carefully, and foundit, in real truth, so exceptionally soft and pure that he extolled itwith incessant praise.
"If you've had any tea this time," Miao-Yue pursued with a seriousexpression about her face, "it's thanks to these two young ladies; forhad you come alone, I wouldn't have given you any."
"I'm well aware of this," Pao-yue laughingly rejoined, "so I too willreceive no favour from your hands, but simply express my thanks to thesetwo cousins of mine, and have done!"
"What you say makes your meaning clear enough!" Miao-yue said, when sheheard his reply.
"Is this rain water from last year?" Tai-yue then inquired.
"How is it," smiled Miao Yue sardonically, "that a person like you can besuch a boor as not to be able to discriminate water, when you taste it?This is snow collected from the plum blossom, five years back, when Iwas in the P'an Hsiang temple at Hsuean Mu. All I got was that flowerjar, green as the devil's face, full, and as I couldn't make up my mindto part with it and drink it, I interred it in the ground, and onlyopened it this summer. I've had some of it once before, and this is thesecond time. But how is it you didn't detect it, when you put it to yourlips? Has rain water, obtained a year back, ever got such a soft andpure flavour? and how possibly could it be drunk at all?"
Tai-yue knew perfectly what a curious disposition she naturally had, andshe did not think it advisable to start any lengthy discussion with her.Nor did she feel justified to protract her stay, so after sipping hertea, she intimated to Pao-ch'ai her intention to go, and they quittedthe apartment.
Pao-yue gave a forced smile to Miao Yue. "That cup," he said, "is, ofcourse, dirty; but is it not a pity to put it away for no valid reason?To my idea it would be preferable, wouldn't it? to give it to that poorold woman; for were she to sell it, she could have the means ofsubsistence! What do you say, will it do?"
Miao Yue listened to his suggestion, and then nodded her head, after somereflection. "Yes, that will be all right!" she answered. "Lucky for herI've never drunk a drop out of that cup, for had I, I would rather havesmashed it to atoms than have let her have it! If you want to give it toher, I don't mind a bit about it; but you yourself must hand it to her!Now, be quick and clear it away at once!"
"Of course; quite so!" Pao-yue continued. "How could you ever go andspeak to her? Things would then come to a worse pass. You too would becontaminated! If you give it to me, it will be all right."
Miao Yue there and then directed some one to fetch it and to give it toPao-yue. When it was brought, Pao-yue took charge of it. "Wait until we'vegone out," he proceeded, "and I'll call a few servant-boys and bid themcarry several buckets of water from the stream and wash the floors; eh,shall I?"
"Yes, that would be better!" Miao Yue smiled. "The only thing is that youmust tell them to bring the water, and place it outside the entrancedoor by the foot of the wall; for they mustn't come in."
"This goes without saying!" Pao-yue said; and, while replying, heproduced the cup from inside his sleeve, and handed it to a youngwaiting-maid from dowager lady Chia's apartments to hold. "To-morrow,"he told her, "give this to goody Liu to take with her, when she startson her way homewards!"
By the time he made (the girl) understand the charge he entrusted herwith, his old grandmother issued out and was anxious to return home.Miao Yue did not exert herself very much to induce her to prolong hervisit; but seeing her as far the main gate, she turned round and boltedthe doors. But without devoting any further attention to her, we willnow allude to dowager lady Chia.
She felt thoroughly tired and exhausted. To such a degree, that shedesired Madame Wang, Ying Ch'un and her sisters to see that Mrs. Hsueehhad some wine, while she herself retired to the Tao Hsiang village torest. Lady Feng immediately bade some servants fetch a bamboo chair. Onits arrival, dowager lady Chia seated herself in it, and two matronscarried her off hemmed in by lady Feng, Li Wan and a bevy ofservant-girls, and matrons. But let us now leave her to herself, withoutany additional explanations.
During this while, Mrs. Hsueeh too said good bye and departed. MadameWang then dismissed Wen Kuan and the other girls, and, distributing theeatables, that had been collected in the partition-boxes, to theservant-maids to go and feast on, she availed herself of the leisuremoments to lie off; so reclining as she was, on the couch, which hadbeen occupied by her old relative a few minutes back, she bade a youngmaid lower the portiere; after which, she asked her to massage her legs.
"Should our old lady yonder send any message, mind you call me at once,"she proceeded to impress on her mind, and, laying herself down, she wentto sleep.
Pao-yue, Hsiang-yuen and the rest watched the servant-girls take thepartition-boxes and place them among the rocks, and seat themselves someon boulders, others on the turf-covered ground, some lean against thetrees, others squat down besides the pool, and thoroughly enjoythemselves. But in a little time, they also perceived Yuean Yang arrive.Her object in coming was to carry off goody Liu for a stroll, so in abody they followed in their track, with a view of deriving some fun.Shortly, they got under the honorary gateway put up in the additionalgrounds, reserved for the imperial consort's visits to her parents, andold goody Liu shouted aloud: "Ai-yoh! What! Is there another big templehere!"
While speaking, she prostrated herself and knocked her head, to theintense amusement of the company, who were quite doubled up withlaughter.
"What are you laughing at?" goody Liu inquired. "I can decipher thecharacters on this honorary gateway. Over at our place temples of thiskind are exceedingly plentiful; and they've all got archways like this!These characters give the name of the temple."
"Can you make out from those characters what temple this is?" theylaughingly asked.
Goody Liu quickly raised her head, and, pointing at the inscription,"Are'nt these," she said, "the four characters 'Pearly Emperor'sPrecious Hall?'"
Everybody laughed. They clapped their hands and applauded. But whenabout to chaff her again, goody Liu experienced a rumbling noise in herstomach, and vehemently pulling a young servant-girl, and asking her fora couple of sheets of paper, she began immediately to loosen hergarments. "It won't do in here!" one and all laughingly shouted out toher, and quickly they directed a matron to lead her away. When they gotat the north-east corner, the matron pointed the proper place out toher, and in high spirits she walked off and went to have some rest.
Goody Liu had taken plenty of wine; she could not too touch yellow wine;she had, what is more, drunk and eaten so many fat things that in thethirst, which supervened, she had emptied several cups of tea; theresult was that she unavoidably got looseness of the bowels. Shetherefore squatted for ever so long before she felt any relief. But onher exit from the private chamber, the wind blew the wine to her head.Besides, being a woman well up in years, she felt, upon suddenly risingfrom a long squatting position, her eyes grow so dim and her head sogiddy that she could not make out the way. She gazed on all fourquarters, but the whole place being covered with trees, rockeries,towers, terraces, and houses, she was quite at a loss how to determineher whereabouts, and where each road led to. She had no alternative butto follow a stone road, and to toddle on her way with leisurely step.But when she drew near a building, she could not make out where the doorcould be. After searching and searching, she accidentally caught sightof a bamboo fence. "Here's another trellis with flat bean plantscreeping on it!" Goody Liu communed within herself. While giving way toreflection, she skirted the flower-laden hedge, and discovering amoonlike, cavelike, entrance, she stepped in. Here she discerned,stretching before her eyes a sheet of water, forming a pond, whichmeasured no more than seven or eight feet in breadth. Its banks werepaved with slabs of stone. Its jadelike waves flowed in a limpid streamtowards the opposite direction. At the upper end, figured a slab ofwhite marble, laid horizontally over the surface. Goody Liu wended hersteps over the slab and followed the raised stone-road; then turning twobends, in the lake, an entrance into a house struck her gaze. Forthwith,she crossed the doorway, but her eyes were soon attracted by a younggirl, who advanced to greet her with a smile playing upon her lips.
"The young ladies," goody Liu speedily remarked laughing, "have cast meadrift; they made me knock about, until I found my way in here."
But seeing, after addressing her, that the girl said nothing by way ofreply, goody Liu approached her and seized her by the hand, when, with acrash, she fell against the wooden partition wall and bumped her head sothat it felt quite sore. Upon close examination, she discovered that itwas a picture. "Do pictures really so bulge out!" Goody Liu mused withinherself, and, as she exercised her mind with these cogitations, shescanned it and rubbed her hand over it. It was perfectly even all over.She nodded her head, and heaved a couple of sighs. But the moment sheturned round, she espied a small door over which hung a soft portiere,of leek-green colour, bestrewn with embroidered flowers. Goody Liulifted the portiere and walked in. Upon raising her head, and casting aglance round, she saw the walls, artistically carved in fretwork. On allfour sides, lutes, double-edged swords, vases and censers were stuckeverywhere over the walls; and embroidered covers and gauze nets,glistened as brightly as gold, and shed a lustre vying with that ofpearls. Even the bricks, on the ground, on which she trod, were jadelikegreen, inlaid with designs, so that her eyes got more and more dazzled.She tried to discover an exit, but where could she find a doorway? Onthe left, was a bookcase. On the right, a screen. As soon as sherepaired behind the screen, she faced a door; but, she then caught sightof another old dame stepping in from outside, and advancing towards her.Goody Liu was wonderstruck. Her mind was full of uncertainty as towhether it might not be her son-in-law's mother. "I expect," she feltprompted to ask with vehemence, "you went to the trouble of coming tohunt for me, as you didn't see me turn up at home for several days, eh?But what young lady introduced you in here?" Then noticing that herwhole head was bedecked with flowers, old goody Liu laughed. "Howignorant of the ways of the world you are!" she said. "Seeing the niceflowers in this garden, you at once set to work, forgetful of allconsequences, and loaded your pate with them!"
However, while she derided her, the other old dame simply laughed,without making any rejoinder. But the recollection suddenly flashed toher memory that she had often heard of some kind of cheval-glasses,found in wealthy and well-to-do families, and, "May it not be," (shewondered), "my own self reflected in this glass!" After concluding thistrain of thoughts, she put out her hands, and feeling it and thenminutely scrutinising it, she realised that the four wooden partitionwalls were made of carved blackwood, into which mirrors had beeninserted. "These have so far impeded my progress," she consequentlyexclaimed, "and how am I to manage to get out?"
As she soliloquised, she kept on rubbing the mirror. This mirror was, infact, provided with some western mechanism, which enabled it to open andshut, so while goody Liu inadvertently passed her hands, quite at randomover its surface, the pressure happily fell on the right spot, andopening the contrivance, the mirror flung round, exposing a door toview. Old goody Liu was full of amazement as well as of admiration. Withhasty step, she egressed. Her eyes unexpectedly fell on a most handsomeset of bed-curtains. But being at the time still seven or eight tenthsin the wind, and quite tired out from her tramp, she with one jumpsquatted down on the bed, saying to herself: "I'll just have a littlerest." So little, however, did she, contrary to her expectations, haveany control over herself, that, as she reeled backwards and forwards,her eyes got quite drowsy, and then the moment she threw herself in arecumbent position, she dropped into a sound sleep.
But let us now see what the others were up to. They waited for her andwaited; but they saw nothing of her. Pan Erh got, in the absence of hisgrandmother, so distressed that he melted into tears. "May she not havefallen into the place?" one and all laughingly observed. "Be quick andtell some one to go and have a look!"
Two matrons were directed to go in search of her; but they returned andreported that she was not to be found. The whole party instituted asearch in every nook and corner, but nothing could be seen of her.
"She was so drunk," Hsi Jen suggested, "that she's sure to have lost herway, and following this road, got into our back-rooms. Should she havecrossed to the inner side of the hedge, she must have come to the doorof the backhouse and got in. Nevertheless, the young maids, she musthave come across, must know something about her. If she did not getinside the hedge, but continued in a south westerly direction, she's allright, if she made a detour and walked out. But if she hasn't done so,why, she'll have enough of roaming for a good long while! I had bettertherefore go and see what she's up to."
With these words still on her lips, she retraced her footsteps andrepaired into the I Hung court. She called out to the servants, but, whowould have thought it, the whole bevy of young maids, attached to thoserooms, had seized the opportunity to go and have a romp, so Hsi Jenstraightway entered the door of the house. As soon as she turned themulticoloured embroidered screen, the sound of snoring as loud as pealsof thunder, fell on her ear. Hastily she betook herself inside, but hernostrils were overpowered by the foul air of wine and w..d, whichinfected the apartment. At a glance, she discovered old goody Liu lyingon the bed, face downwards, with hands sprawled out and feet knockingabout all over the place. Hsi Jen sustained no small shock. Withprecipitate hurry, she rushed up to her, and, laying hold of her, lyingas she was more dead than alive, she pushed her about until shesucceeded in rousing her to her senses. Old goody Liu was startled outof her sleep. She opened wide her eyes, and, realising that Hsi Jenstood before her, she speedily crawled up. "Miss!" she pleaded. "I dodeserve death! I have done what I shouldn't; but I haven't in any waysoiled the bed."
So saying, she swept her hands over it. But Hsi Jen was in fear andtrembling lest the suspicions of any inmate should be aroused, and lestPao-yue should come to know of it, so all she did was to wave her handtowards her, bidding her not utter a word. Then with alacrity graspingthree or four handfuls of 'Pai Ho' incense, she heaped it on the largetripod, which stood in the centre of the room, and put the lid backagain; delighted at the idea that she had not been so upset as to besick.
"It doesn't matter!" she quickly rejoined in a low tone of voice with asmile, "I'm here to answer for this. Come along with me!"
While old goody Liu expressed her readiness to comply with her wishes,she followed Hsi Jen out into the quarters occupied by the young maids.Here (Hsi Jen) desired her to take a seat. "Mind you say," she enjoinedher, "that you were so drunk that you stretched on a boulder and had asnooze!"
"All right! I will!" old goody Liu promised.
Hsi Jen afterwards helped her to two cups of tea, when she, at length,got over the effects of the wine. "What young lady's room is this thatit is so beautiful?" she then inquired. "It seemed to me just as if Ihad gone to the very heavenly palace."
Hsi Jen gave a faint smile. "This one?" she asked. "Why, it's our masterSecundus', Mr. Pao's bedroom."
Old goody Liu was quite taken aback, and could not even presume to uttera sound. But Hsi Jen led her out across the front compound; and, whenthey met the inmates of the family, she simply explained to them thatshe had found her fast asleep on the grass, and brought her along. Noone paid any heed to the excuse she gave, and the subject was dropped.
Presently, dowager lady Chia awoke, and the evening meal was at onceserved in the Tao Hsiang Ts'un. Dowager lady Chia was however quitelistless, and felt so little inclined to eat anything that she forthwithgot into a small open chair, with bamboo seat, and returned to her suiteof rooms to rest. But she insisted that lady Feng and her companionsshould go and have their repast, so the young ladies eventuallyadjourned once more into the garden.
But, reader, you do not know the sequel, so peruse the circumstancesgiven in detail in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XLII.
  The Princess of Heng Wu dispels, with sweet words, some insane      suspicions.  The inmate of Hsiao Hsiang puts, with excellent repartee, the final      touch to the jokes made about goody Liu.
We will now resume our story by adding that, on the return of the youngladies into the garden, they had their meal. This over, they partedcompany, and nothing more need be said about them. We will notice,however, that old goody Liu took Pan Erh along with her, and came firstand paid a visit to lady Feng. "We must certainly start for hometo-morrow, as soon as it is daylight," she said. "I've stayed here, it'strue, only two or three days, but in these few days I have reapedexperience in everything that I had not seen from old till now. It wouldbe difficult to find any one as compassionate of the poor andconsiderate to the old as your venerable dame, your Madame Wang, youryoung ladies, and the girls too attached to the various rooms, have allshown themselves in their treatment of me! When I get home now, I shallhave no other means of showing how grateful I am to you than bypurchasing a lot of huge joss-sticks and saying daily prayers to Buddhaon your behalf; and if he spares you all to enjoy a long life of ahundred years my wishes will be accomplished."
"Don't be so exultant!" lady Feng smilingly replied. "It's all onaccount of you that our old ancestor has fallen ill, by exposing herselfto draughts and that she suffers from disturbed sleep; also that our TaChieh-erh has caught a chill and is laid up at home with fever."
Goody Liu, at these words, speedily heaved a sigh. "Her venerableladyship," she said, "is a person advanced in years and not accustomedto any intense fatigue!"
"She has never before been in such high spirits as yesterday!" lady Fengobserved. "As you were here, so anxious was she to let you seeeverything, that she trudged over the greater part of the garden. And TaChieh-erh was given a piece of cake by Madame Wang, when I came to huntyou up, and she ate it, who knows in what windy place, and began at onceto get feverish."
"Ta Chieh-erh," goody Liu remarked, "hasn't, I fancy, often put her footinto the garden; and young people like her mustn't really go intostrange places, for she's not like our children, who are able to usetheir legs! In what graveyards don't they ramble about! A puff of windmay, on the one hand, have struck her, it's not at all unlikely; orbeing, on the other, so chaste in body, and her eyes also so pure shemay, it is to be feared, have come across some spirit or other. I can'thelp thinking therefore that you should consult some book of exorcismson her behalf; for mind she may have run up against some evilinfluence."
This remark suggested the idea to lady Feng. There and then she calledP'ing Erh to fetch the 'Jade Box Record.' When brought, she desiredTs'ai Ming to look over it for her. Ts'ai Ming turned over the pages fora time, and then read: 'Those who fall ill on the 25th day of the 8thmoon have come across, in a due westerly quarter, of some flower spirit;they feel heavy, with no inclination for drink or food. Take sevensheets of white paper money, and, advancing forty steps due west, burnthem and exorcise the spirit; recovery will follow at once!'"
"There's really no mistake about that!" lady Feng smiled. "Are there notflower spirits in the garden? But what I dread is that our old ladymayn't have come across one too."
Saying this, she bade a servant purchase two lots of paper money. Ontheir arrival, she sent for two proper persons, the one to exorcise thespirits for dowager lady Chia and the other to expel them from TaChieh-erh; and these observances over, Ta Chieh-erh did, in effect, dropquietly to sleep.
"It's verily people advanced in years like you," lady Feng smilinglyexclaimed; "who've gone through many experiences! This Ta Chieh-erh ofmine has often been inclined to ail, and it has quite puzzled me to makeout how and why it was."
"This isn't anything out of the way!" goody Liu said. "Affluent andhonourable people bring up their offspring to be delicate. So naturally,they are not able to endure the least hardship! Moreover, that youngchild of yours is so excessively cuddled that she can't stand it. Wereyou, therefore, my lady, to pamper her less from henceforth, she'llsteadily improve."
"There's plenty of reason in that too!" lady Feng observed. "But itstrikes me that she hasn't as yet got a name, so do give her one inorder that she may borrow your long life! In the next place, you arecountry-people, and are, after all,--I don't expect you'll get angrywhen I mention it,--somewhat in poor circumstances. Were a person thenas poor as you are to suggest a name for her, you may, I trust, have theeffect of counteracting this influence for her."
When old goody Liu heard this proposal, she immediately gave herself upto reflection. "I've no idea of the date of her birth!" she smiled aftera time.
"She really was born on no propitious date!" lady Feng replied. "By aremarkable coincidence she came into the world on the seventh day of theseventh moon!"
"This is certainly splendid!" old goody Lin laughed with alacrity. "Youhad better name her at once Ch'iao Chieh-erh (seventh moon andingenuity). This is what's generally called: combating poison by poisonand attacking fire by fire. If therefore your ladyship fixes upon thisname of mine, she will, for a surety, attain a long life of a hundredyears; and when she by and bye grows up to be a big girl, every one ofyou will be able to have a home and get a patrimony! Or if, at any time,there occur anything inauspicious and she has to face adversity, why itwill inevitably change into prosperity; and if she comes across any evilfortune, it will turn into good fortune. And this will all arise fromthis one word, 'Ch'iao' (ingenuity.)"
Lady Feng was, needless to say, delighted by what she heard, and shelost no time in expressing her gratitude. "If she be preserved," sheexclaimed, "to accomplish your good wishes, it will be such a goodthing!" Saying this, she called P'ing Erh. "As you and I are bound to bebusy to-morrow," she said, "and won't, I fear, be able to spare anyleisure moments, you'd better, if you have nothing to do now, get readythe presents for old goody Liu, so as to enable her to convenientlystart at early dawn to-morrow."
"How could I presume to be the cause of such reckless waste?" goody Liuinterposed. "I've already disturbed your peace and quiet for severaldays, and were I to also take your things away, I'd feel still less atease in my heart!"
"There's nothing much!" lady Feng protested. "They consist simply of afew ordinary things. But, whether good or bad, do take them along, sothat the people in the same street as yourselves and your next-doorneighbours may have some little excitement, and that it may look as ifyou had been on a visit to the city!"
But while she endeavoured to induce the old dame to accept the presents,she noticed P'ing Erh approach. "Goody Liu," she remarked, "come overhere and see!"
Old goody Liu precipitately followed P'ing Erh into the room on the offside. Here she saw the stove-couch half full with piles of things. P'ingErh took these up one by one and let her have a look at them. "This,"she explained, "is a roll of that green gauze you asked for yesterday.Besides this, our lady Feng gives you a piece of thick bluish-whitegauze to use as lining. These are two pieces of pongee, which will dofor wadded coats and jupes as well. In this bundle are two pieces ofsilk, for you to make clothes with, for the end of the year. This is abox containing various home-made cakes. Among them are some you'vealready tasted and some you haven't; so take them along, and put them inplates and invite your friends; they'll be ever so much better than anythat you could buy! These two bags are those in which the melons andfruit were packed up yesterday. This one has been filled with twobushels of fine rice, grown in the imperial fields, the like of whichfor congee, it would not be easy to get. This one contains fruits fromour garden and all kinds of dry fruits. In this packet, you'll findeight taels of silver. These various things are presents for you fromour Mistress Secunda. Each of these packets contains fifty taels so thatthere are in all a hundred taels; they're the gift of Madame Wang. Shebids you accept them so as to either carry on any trade, for which nobig capital is required, or to purchase several acres of land, in orderthat you mayn't henceforward have any more to beg favours of relatives,or to depend upon friends." Continuing, she added smilingly, in a lowtone of voice, "These two jackets, two jupes, four head bands, and abundle of velvet and thread are what I give you, worthy dame, as myshare. These clothes are, it is true, the worse for use, yet I haven'tworn them very much. But if you disdain them, I won't be so presuming asto say anything."
After mention of each article by P'ing Erh, goody Liu muttered the nameof Buddha, so already she had repeated Buddha's name several thousandsof times. But when she saw the heap of presents which P'ing Erh toobestowed on her, and the little ostentation with which she did it, shepromptly smiled. "Miss!" she said, "what are you saying? Could I everdisdain such nice gifts as these! Had I even the money, I couldn't buythem anywhere. The only thing is that I feel overpowered with shame. IfI keep them, it won't be nice, and if I don't accept them, I shall beshowing myself ungrateful for your kind attention."
"Don't utter all this irrelevant talk!" P'ing Erh laughed. "You and Iare friends; so compose your mind and take the things I gave you justnow! Besides, I have, on my part, something to ask of you. When theclose of the year comes, select a few of your cabbages, dipped in lime,and dried in the sun, as well as some lentils, flat beans, tomatoes andpumpkin strips, and various sorts of dry vegetables and bring them over.We're all, both high or low, fond of such things. These will be quiteenough! We don't want anything else, so don't go to any uselesstrouble!"
Goody Liu gave utterance to profuse expressions of gratitude andsignified her readiness to comply with her wishes.
"Just you go to sleep," P'ing Erh urged, "and I'll get the things readyfor you and put them in here. As soon as the day breaks to-morrow, I'llsend the servant-lads to hire a cart and pack them in; don't youtherefore worry yourself in the least on that score!"
Goody Liu felt more and more ineffably grateful. So crossing over, sheagain said, with warm protestations of thankfulness, good bye to ladyFeng; after which, she repaired to dowager lady Chia's quarters on thisside, where she slept, with one sleep, during the whole night. Early thenext day, as soon as she had combed her hair and performed herablutions, she asked to go and pay her adieus to lady Chia. But as oldlady Chia was unwell, the various members of the family came to see howshe was getting on. On their reappearance outside, they transmittedorders that the doctor should be sent for. In a little time, a matronreported that the doctor had arrived, and an old nurse invited dowagerlady Chia to ensconce herself under the curtain.
"I'm an old woman!" lady Chia remonstrated. "Am I not aged enough to bea mother to that fellow? and am I, pray, to still stand on anyceremonies with him? There's no need to drop the curtain; I'll see himas I am, and have done."
Hearing her objections, the matrons fetched a small table, and, laying asmall pillow on it, they directed a servant to ask the doctor in.
Presently, they perceived the trio Chia Chen, Chia Lien, and Chia Jung,bringing Dr. Wang. Dr. Wang did not presume to use the raised road, butconfining himself to the side steps, he kept pace with Chia Chen untilthey reached the platform. Two matrons, who had been standing, one oneither side from an early hour, raised the portiere. A couple of oldwomen servants then took the lead and showed the way in. But Pao-yue tooappeared on the scene to meet them.
They found old lady Chia seated bolt upright on the couch, dressed in ablue crape jacket, lined with sheep skin, every curl of which resembleda pearl. On the right and left stood four young maids, whose hair hadnot as yet been allowed to grow, with fly-brushes, finger-bowls, andother such articles in their hands. Five or six old nurses were alsodrawn up on both sides like wings. At the back of the jade-green gauzemosquito-house were faintly visible several persons in red and greenhabiliments, with gems on their heads, and gold trinkets in theircoiffures.
Dr. Wang could not muster the courage to raise his head. With speedystep, he advanced and paid his obeisance. Dowager lady Chia noticed thathe wore the official dress of the sixth grade, and she accordinglyconcluded that he must be an imperial physician. "How are you nobledoctor?" she inquired, forcing a smile. "What is the worthy surname ofthis noble doctor?" she then asked Chia Chen.
Chia Chen and his companions made prompt reply. "His surname is Wang,"they said.
"There was once a certain Wang Chuen-hsiao who filled the chair ofPresident of the College of Imperial Physicians," dowager lady smilinglyproceeded. "He excelled in feeling the pulse."
Dr. Wang bent his body, and with alacrity he lowered his head andreturned her smile. "That was," he explained, "my grand uncle."
"Is it really so!" laughingly pursued dowager lady Chia, upon catchingthis reply. "We can then call ourselves old friends!"
So speaking, she quietly put out her hand and rested it on the smallpillow. A nurse laid hold of a small stool and placed it before thesmall table, slightly to the side of it. Dr. Wang bent one knee and tooka seat on the stool. Drooping his head, he felt the pulse of the onehand for a long while; next, he examined that of the other; after which,hastily making a curtsey, he bent his head and started on his way out ofthe apartment.
"Excuse me for the trouble I've put you to!" dowager lady Chia smiled."Chen Erh, escort him outside, and do see that he has a cup of tea."
Chia Chen, Chia Lien and the rest of their companions immediatelyacquiesced by uttering several yes's, and once more they led Dr. Wanginto the outer study.
"Your worthy senior," Dr. Wang explained, "has nothing else the matterwith her than a slight chill, which she must have inadvertentlycontracted. She needn't, after all, take any medicines; all she need dois to diet herself and keep warm a little; and she'll get all right. ButI'll now write a prescription, in here. Should her venerable ladyshipcare to take any of the medicine, then prepare a dose, according to theprescription, and let her have it. But should she be loth to have any,well, never mind, it won't be of any consequence."
Saying this, he wrote the prescription, as he sipped his tea. But whenabout to take his leave, he saw a nurse bring Ta Chieh-erh into theroom. "Mr. Wang," she said, "do also have a look at our Chieh Erh!"
Upon hearing her appeal, Dr. Wang immediately rose to his feet. Whileshe was clasped in her nurse's arms, he rested Ta Chieh-erh's hand onhis left hand and felt her pulse with his right, and rubbing herforehead, he asked her to put out her tongue and let him see it. "Were Ito express my views about Chieh Erh, you would again abuse me! If she's,however, kept quiet and allowed to go hungry for a couple of meals,she'll get over this. There's no necessity for her to take any decoctedmedicines. I'll just send her some pills, which you'll have to dissolvein a preparation of ginger, and give them to her before she goes tosleep; when she has had these, there will be nothing more the matterwith her."
At the conclusion of these recommendations, he bade them goodbye andtook his departure. Chia Chen and his companions then took theprescription and came and explained to old lady Chia the nature of herindisposition, and, depositing on the table, the paper given to them bythe doctor, they quitted her presence. But nothing more need be saidabout them.
Madame Wang and Li Wan, lady Feng, Pao Ch'ai and the other young ladiesnoticed, meanwhile, that the doctor had gone, and they eventuallyegressed from the back of the mosquito-house. After a short stay, MadameWang returned to her quarters. Goody Liu repaired, when she perceivedeverything quiet again, into the upper rooms and made her adieus todowager lady Chia.
"When you've got any leisure, do pay us another visit," old lady Chiaurged, and bidding Yuan Yang come to her, "Do be careful," she added,"and see dame Liu safely on her way out; for not being well I can'tescort you myself."
Goody Liu expressed her thanks, and saying good bye a second time, shebetook herself, along with Yuean Yang, into the servants' quarters. HereYuean Yang pointed at a bundle on the stove-couch. "These are," she said,"several articles of clothing, belonging to our old mistress; they werepresented to her in years gone by, by members of our family on herbirthdays and various festivals; her ladyship never wears anything madeby people outside; yet to hoard these would be a downright pity! Indeed,she hasn't worn them even once. It was yesterday that she told me to getout two costumes and hand them to you to take along with you, either togive as presents, or to be worn by some one in your home; but don't makefun of us! In the box you'll find the flour-fruits, for which you asked.This bundle contains the medicines to which you alluded the other day.There are 'plum-blossom-spotted-tongue pills,' and 'purple-gold-ingot- pills,' also 'vivifying-blood-vessels-pills,' as well as'driving-offspring and preserving-life pills;' each kind being rolledup in a sheet bearing the prescription; and the whole lot of them arepacked up in here. While these two are purses for you to wear in the wayof ornaments." So saying, she forthwith loosened the cord, and,producing two ingots representing pencils, and with 'ju i' on them,implying 'your wishes will surely be fulfilled,' she drew near andshowed them to her, "Take the purses," she pursued smiling, "but doleave these behind and give them to me."
Goody Liu was so overjoyed that she had, from an early period, come outafresh with several thousands of invocations of Buddha's names. When shetherefore heard Yuean Yang's suggestion, "Miss," she quickly rejoined,"you're at perfect liberty to keep them!"
Yuean Yang perceived that her words were believed by her; so smiling sheonce more dropped the ingots into the purse. "I was only joking with youfor fun!" she observed. "I've got a good many like these; keep themtherefore and give them, at the close of the year, to your youngchildren."
Speaking the while, she espied a young maid walk in with a cup from the'Ch'eng' kiln, and hand it to old goody Liu. "This," (she said,) "ourmaster Secundus, Mr. Pao, gives you."
"Whence could I begin enumerating the things I got!" Goody Liuexclaimed. "In what previous existence did I accomplish anything someritorious as to bring to-day this heap of blessings upon me!"
With these words, she eagerly took possession of the cup.
"The clothes I gave you the other day, when I asked you to have a bath,were my own," Yuean Yang resumed, "and if you don't think them too mean,I've got a few more, which I would also like to let you have."
Goody Liu thanked her with vehemence, so Yuean Yang, in point of fact,produced several more articles of clothing, and these she packed up forher. Goody Liu thereupon expressed a desire to also go into the gardenand take leave of Pao-yue and the young ladies, Madame Wang and the otherinmates and to thank them for all they did for her, but Yuean Yang raisedobjections. "You can dispense with going!" she remarked. "They don't seeany one just now! But I'll deliver the message for you by and bye! Whenyou've got any leisure, do come again. Go to the second gate," she wenton to direct an old matron, "and call two servant-lads to come here, andhelp this old dame to take her things away!"
After the matron had signified her obedience, Yuean Yang returned withgoody Liu to lady Feng's quarters, on the off part of the mansion, and,taking the presents as far as the side gate, she bade the servant-ladscarry them out. She herself then saw goody Liu into her curricle andstart on her journey homewards.
But without commenting further on this topic, let us revert to Pao-ch'aiand the other girls. After breakfast, they recrossed into theirgrandmother's rooms and made inquiries about her health. On their wayback to the garden, they reached a point where they had to takedifferent roads. Pao-ch'ai then called out to Tai-yue. "P'in Erh!" sheobserved, "come with me; I've got a question to ask you."
Tai-yue wended her steps therefore with Pao-ch'ai into the Heng Wu court.As soon as they entered the house, Pao-ch'ai threw herself into a seat."Kneel down!" she smiled. "I want to examine you about something!"
Tai-yue could not fathom her object, and consequently laughed. "Lookhere." she cried, "this chit Pao has gone clean off her senses! What doyou want to examine me about?"
Pao-ch'ai gave a sardonic smile. "My dear, precious girl, my dearmaiden," she exclaimed, "what utter trash fills your mouth! Just speakthe honest and candid truth, and finish!"
Tai-yue could so little guess her meaning that her sole resource was tosmile. Inwardly, however, she could not help beginning to experiencecertain misgivings. "What did I say?" she remarked. "You're bent uponpicking out my faults! Speak out and let me hear what it's all about!"
"Do you still pretend to be a fool?" Pao-ch'ai laughed. "When we playedyesterday that game of wine-forfeits, what did you say? I reallycouldn't make out any head or tail."
Tai-yue, after a moment's reflection, remembered eventually that she hadthe previous day been guilty of a slip of the tongue and come out with acouple of passages from the 'Peony Pavilion,' and the 'Record of theWest Side-house,' and, of a sudden, her face got scarlet with blushes.Drawing near Pao-ch'ai she threw her arms round her. "My dear cousin!"she smiled, "I really wasn't conscious of what I was saying! It justblurted out of my mouth! But now that you've called me to task, I won'tsay such things again."
"I've no idea of what you were driving at," Pao-ch'ai laughinglyrejoined. "What I heard you recite sounds so thoroughly unfamiliar tome, that I beg you to enlighten me!"
"Dear cousin," pleaded Tai-yue, "don't tell anyone else! I won't, in thefuture, breathe such things again."
Pao-ch'ai noticed how from shame the blood rushed to her face, and howvehement she was in her entreaties, and she felt both to press her withquestions; so pulling her into a seat to make her have a cup of tea, shesaid to her in a gentle tone, "Whom do you take me for? I too amwayward; from my youth up, yea ever since I was seven or eight, I'vebeen enough trouble to people! Our family was also what one would termliterary. My grandfather's extreme delight was to be ever with a book inhis hand. At one time, we numbered many members, and sisters andbrothers all lived together; but we had a distaste for wholesome books.Among my brothers, some were partial to verses; others had a weaknessfor blank poetical compositions; and there were none of such works asthe 'Western side-House,' and 'the Guitar,' even up to the hundred andone books of the 'Yuean' authors, which they hadn't managed to get. Thesebooks they stealthily read behind our backs; but we, on our part,devoured them, on the sly, without their knowing it. Subsequently, ourfather came to get wind of it; and some of us he beat, while others hescolded; burning some of the books, and throwing away others. It istherefore as well that we girls shouldn't know anything of letters. Men,who study books and don't understand the right principle, can't,moreover, reach the standard of those, who don't go in for books; so howmuch more such as ourselves? Even versifying, writing and the likepursuits aren't in the line of such as you and me. Indeed, neither arethey within the portion of men. Men, who go in for study and fathom theright principles, should cooperate in the government of the empire, andshould rule the nation; this would be a nobler purpose; but one doesn'tnow-a-days hear of the very existence of such persons! Hence, the studyof books makes them worse than they ever were before. But it isn't thebooks that ruin them; the misfortune is that they make improper use ofbooks! That is why study doesn't come up to ploughing and sowing andtrading; as these pursuits exercise no serious pernicious influences. Asfar, however, as you and I go, we should devote our minds simply tomatters connected with needlework and spinning; for we will then befulfilling our legitimate duties. Yet, it so happens that we too know afew characters. But, as we can read, it behoves us to choose no otherthan wholesome works; for these will do us no harm! What are most to beshirked are those low books, as, when once they pervert the disposition,there remains no remedy whatever!"
While she indulged in this long rigmarole, Tai-yue lowered her head andsipped her tea. And though she secretly shared the same views on thesubject, all the answer she gave her in assent was limited to one singleword 'yes.' But at an unexpected moment, Su Yuen appeared in the room."Our lady Lien," she said, "requests the presence of both of you, youngladies, to consult with you in an important matter. Miss Secunda, MissTertia, Miss Quarta, Miss Shih and Mr. Pao, our master Secundus, arethere waiting for you."
"What's up again?" Pao-ch'ai inquired.
"You and I will know what it is when we get there," Tai-yue explained.
So saying, she came, with Pao-ch'ai, into the Tao Hsiang village. Herethey, in fact, discovered every one assembled. As soon as Li Wan caughtsight of the two cousins, she smiled. "The society has barely beenstarted," she observed, "and here's one who wants to give us the slip;that girl Quarta wishes to apply for a whole year's leave."
"It's that single remark of our worthy senior's yesterday that is at thebottom of it!" Tai-yue laughed. "For by bidding her execute some paintingor other of the garden, she has put her in such high feather that sheapplies for leave!"
"Don't be so hard upon our dear ancestor!" Pao-Ch'ai rejoined, a smileplaying on her lips. "It's entirely due to that allusion of grandmotherLiu's."
Tai-yue speedily took up the thread of the conversation. "Quite so!" shesmiled. "It's all through that remark of hers! But of what branch of thefamily is she a grandmother? We should merely address her as the 'femalelocust;' that's all."
As she spoke, one and all were highly amused.
"When any mortal language finds its way into that girl Feng's mouth,"Pao-ch'ai laughed, "she knows how to turn it to the best account! What afortunate thing it is that that vixen Feng has no idea of letters andcan't boast of much culture! Her _forte_ is simply such vulgarthings as suffice to raise a laugh! Worse than her is that P'in Erh withthat coarse tongue! She has recourse to the devices of the 'Ch'unCh'iu'! By selecting, from the vulgar expressions used in low slang, themost noteworthy points, she eliminates what's commonplace, and makes,with the addition of a little elegance and finish, her style so muchlike that of the text that each sentence has a peculiar character of itsown! The three words representing 'female locust' bring out clearly thevarious circumstances connected with yesterday! The wonder is that shehas been so quick in devising them!"
After lending an ear to her arguments, they all laughed. "Thoseexplanations of yours," they cried, "show well enough that you are notbelow those two!"
"Pray, let's consult as to how many days' leave to grant her!" Li Wanproposed. "I gave her a month, but she thinks it too little. What do yousay about it?"
"Properly speaking," Tai-yue put in, "one year isn't much! The laying outof this garden occupied a whole year; and to paint a picture of it nowwill certainly need two years' time. She'll have to rub the ink, tomoisten the pencils, to stretch the paper, to mix the pigments, andto...."
When she had reached this point, even Tai-yue could not restrain herselffrom laughing. "If she goes on so leisurely to work," she exclaimed,"won't she require two years' time?"
Those, who caught this insinuation, clapped their hands and indulged inincessant merriment.
"Her innuendoes are full of zest!" Pao-ch'ai ventured laughingly. "Butwhat takes the cake is that last remark about leisurely going to work,for if she weren't to paint at all, how could she ever finish her task?Hence those jokes cracked yesterday were, sufficient, of course, toevoke laughter, but, on second thought, they're devoid of any fun! Justyou carefully ponder over P'in Erh's words! Albeit they don't amount tomuch, you'll nevertheless find, when you come to reflect on them, thatthere's plenty of gusto about them. I've really had such a laugh overthem that I can scarcely move!
"It's the way that cousin Pao-ch'ai puffs her up," Hsi Ch'un observed"that makes her so much the more arrogant that she turns me also into alaughing-stock now!"
Tai-yue hastily smiled and pulled her towards her. "Let me ask you," shesaid, "are you only going to paint the garden, or will you insert us init as well?"
"My original idea was to have simply painted the garden," Hsi Ch'unexplained; "but our worthy senior told me again yesterday that a merepicture of the grounds would resemble the plan of a house, andrecommended that I should introduce some inmates too so as to make itlook like what a painting should. I've neither the knack for the finework necessary for towers and terraces, nor have I the skill to drawrepresentations of human beings; but as I couldn't very well raise anyobjections, I find myself at present on the horns of a dilemma aboutit!"
"Human beings are an easy matter!" Tai-yue said. "What beats you areinsects."
"Here you are again with your trash!" Li Wan exclaimed. "Will there beany need to also introduce insects in it? As far, however, as birds go,it may probably be advisable to introduce one or two kinds!"
"If any other insects are not put in the picture," Tai-yue smiled, "itwon't matter; but without yesterday's female locust in it, it will fallshort of the original?"
This retort evoked further general amusement. While Tai-yue laughed, shebeat her chest with both hands. "Begin painting at once!" she cried."I've even got the title all ready. The name I've chosen is, 'Picture ofa locust brought in to have a good feed.'"
At these words, they laughed so much the more heartily that at a timethey bent forward, and at another they leant back. But a sound of "Kutung" then fell on their ears, and unable to make out what could havedropped, they anxiously and precipitately looked about. It was, theyfound, Shih Hsiang-yuen, who had been reclining on the back of the chair.The chair had, from the very outset, not been put in a sure place, andwhile indulging in hearty merriment she threw her whole weight on theback. She did not, besides, notice that the dovetails on each side hadcome out, so with a tilt towards the east, she as well as the chairtoppled over in a heap. Luckily, the wooden partition-wall was closeenough to arrest her fall, and she did not sprawl on the ground. Thesight of her created more amusement than ever among all her relatives;so much so, that they could scarcely regain their equilibrium. It wasonly after Pao-yue had rushed up to her, and given her a hand and raisedher to her feet again that they at last managed to gradually stoplaughing.
Pao-yue then winked at Tai-yue. Tai-yue grasped his meaning, and, forthwithwithdrawing into the inner room, she lifted the cover of the mirror, andlooked at her face. She found the hair about her temples slightlydishevelled, so, promptly opening Li Wan's toilet-case, and extracting anarrow brush, she stood in front of the mirror, and smoothed it downwith a few touches. Afterwards, laying the brush in its place shestepped into the outer suite. "Is this," she said pointing at Li Wan,"doing what you're told and showing us how to do needlework and teachingus manners? Why, instead of that, you press us to come here and have agood romp and a hearty laugh!"
"Just you listen to her perverse talk," Li Wan laughed. "She takes thelead and kicks up a rumpus, and incites people to laugh, and then shethrows the blame upon me! In real truth, she's a despicable thing! WhatI wish is that you should soon get some dreadful mother-in-law, andseveral crotchety and abominable older and younger sisters-in-law, andwe'll see then whether you'll still be as perverse or not!"
Tai-yue at once became quite scarlet in the face, and pulling Pao-ch'ai,"Let us," she added, "give her a whole year's leave!"
"I've got an impartial remark to make. Listen to me all of you!"Pao-ch'ai chimed in. "Albeit the girl, Ou, may have some idea aboutpainting, all she can manage are just a few outline sketches, so thatunless, now that she has to accomplish the picture of this garden, shecan lay a claim to some ingenuity, will she ever be able to succeed ineffecting a painting? This garden resembles a regular picture. Therockeries and trees, towers and pavilions, halls and houses are, as faras distances and density go, neither too numerous, nor too few. Such asit is, it is fitly laid out; but were you to put it on paper in strictcompliance with the original, why, it will surely not elicit admiration.In a thing like this, it's necessary to pay due care to the variouspositions and distances on paper, whether they should be large orwhether small; and to discriminate between main and secondary; addingwhat is needful to add, concealing and reducing what should be concealedand reduced, and exposing to view what should remain visible. As soon asa rough copy is executed, it should again be considered in all itsdetails, for then alone will it assume the semblance of a picture. Inthe second place, all these towers, terraces and structures must bedistinctly delineated; for with just a trifle of inattention, therailings will slant, the pillars will be topsy-turvy, doors and windowswill recline in a horizontal position, steps will separate, leavingclefts between them, and even tables will be crowded into the walls, andflower-pots piled on portieres; and won't it, instead of turning outinto a picture, be a mere caricature? Thirdly, proper care must also bedevoted, in the insertion of human beings, to density and height, to thecreases of clothing, to jupes and sashes, to fingers, hands, and feet,as these are most important details; for if even one stroke be notthoroughly executed, then, if the hands be not swollen, the feet will bemade to look as if they were lame. The colouring of faces and thedrawing of the hair are minor points; but, in my own estimation, theyreally involve intense difficulty. Now a year's leave is, on one hand,too excessive, and a month's is, on the other, too little; so just giveher half a year's leave. Depute, besides, cousin Pao-yue to lend her ahand in her task. Not that cousin Pao knows how to give any hints aboutpainting; that in itself would be more of a drawback; but in order that,in the event of there being anything that she doesn't comprehend, or ofanything perplexing her as to how best to insert it, cousin Pao may takethe picture outside and make the necessary inquiries of those gentlemen,who excel in painting. Matters will thus be facilitated for her."
At this suggestion Pao-yue was the first to feel quite enchanted. "Thisproposal is first-rate!" he exclaimed. "The towers and terraces minutelyexecuted by Chan Tzu-liang are so perfect, and the beauties painted byCh'eng Jih-hsing so extremely fine that I'll go at once and ask them ofthem!"
"I've always said that you fuss for nothing!" Pao-ch'ai interposed. "Imerely passed a cursory remark, and there you want to go immediately andask for things. Do wait until we arrive at some decision in ourdeliberations, and then you can go! But let's consider now what would bebest to use to paint the picture on?"
"I've got, in my quarters," Pao-yue answered, "some snow-white, wavypaper, which is both large in size, and proof against ink as well."
Pao-ch'ai gave a sarcastic smile. "I do maintain," she cried, "that youare a perfectly useless creature! That snow-white, wavy paper is goodfor pictures consisting of characters and for outline drawings. Or else,those who have the knack of making landscapes, use it for depictingscenery of the southern Sung era, as it resists ink and is strong enoughto bear coarse painting. But were you to employ this sort of paper tomake a picture of this garden on, it will neither stand the colours, norwill it be easy to dry the painting by the fire. So not only won't it besuitable, but it will be a pity too to waste the paper. I'll tell you away how to get out of this. When this garden was first laid out, somedetailed plan was used, which although executed by a merehouse-decorator, was perfect with regard to sites and bearings. You'dbetter therefore ask for it of your worthy mother, and apply as well tolady Feng for a piece of thick glazed lustring of the size of thatpaper, and hand them to the gentlemen outside, and request them toprepare a rough copy for you, with any alterations or additions as mightbe necessary to make so as to accord with the style of these grounds.All that will remain to be done will be to introduce a few human beings;no more. Then when you have to match the azure and green pigments aswell as the ground gold and ground silver, you can get those peopleagain to do so for you. But you'll also have to bring an extra portablestove, so as to have it handy for melting the glue, and for washing yourpencils, after you've taken the glue off. You further require a largetable, painted white and covered with a cloth. That lot of small dishesyou have aren't sufficient; your pencils too are not enough. It will bewell consequently for you to purchase a new set of each."
"Do I own such a lot of painting materials!" Hsi Ch'un exclaimed. "Why,I simply use any pencil that first comes under my hand to paint with;that's all. And as for pigments, I've only got four kinds, ochrey stone,'Kuang' flower paint, rattan yellow and rouge. Besides these, all I haveamount to a couple of pencils for applying colours; no more."
"Why didn't you say so earlier?" Pao-ch'ai remarked. "I've still gotsome of these things remaining. But you don't need them, so were I togive you any, they'd lie uselessly about. I'll put them away for you nowfor a time, and, when you want them, I'll let you have some. You should,however, keep them for the exclusive purpose of painting fans; for wereyou to paint such big things with them it would be a pity! I'll draw outa list for you to-day to enable you to go and apply to our worthy seniorfor the items; as it isn't likely that you people can possibly know allthat's required. I'll dictate them, and cousin Pao can write them down!"
Pao-yue had already got a pencil and inkslab ready, for, fearing lest hemight not remember clearly the various necessaries, he had made up hismind to write a memorandum of them; so the moment he heard Pao-ch'ai'ssuggestion, he cheerfully took up his pencil, and listened quietly.
"Four pencils of the largest size," Pao-ch'ai commenced, "four of thethird size; four of the second size; four pencils for applying colourson big ground; four on medium ground; four for small ground; ten clawsof large southern crabs; ten claws of small crabs; ten pencils forpainting side-hair and eyebrows; twenty for laying heavy colours; twentyfor light colours; ten for painting faces; twenty willow-twigs; fourounces of 'arrow head' pearls; four ounces of southern ochre; fourounces of stone yellow; four ounces of dark green; four ounces ofmalachite; four ounces of tube-yellow; eight ounces of 'kuang' flower;four boxes of lead powder; ten sheets of rouge; two hundred sheets ofthin red-gold leaves; two hundred sheets of lead; four ounces of smoothglue, from the two Kuang; and four ounces of pure alum. The glue andalum for sizing the lustring are not included, so don't botheryourselves about them, but just take the lustring and give it to themoutside to size it with alum for you. You and I can scour and clarifyall these pigments, and thus amuse ourselves, and prepare them for useas well. I feel sure you'll have an ample supply to last you a wholelifetime. But you must also get ready four sieves of fine lustring; apair of coarse ones; four brush-pencils; four bowls, some large, somesmall; twenty large, coarse saucers; ten five-inch plates; twentythree-inch coarse, white plates; two stoves; four large and smallearthenware pans; two new porcelain jars; four new water buckets; fourone-foot-long bags, made of white cloth; two catties of light charcoal;one or two catties of willow-wood charcoal; a wooden box with threedrawers; a yard of thick gauze, two ounces of fresh ginger; half a cattyof soy;..."
"An iron kettle and an iron shovel," hastily chimed in Tai-yue with asmile full of irony.
"To do what with them?" Pao-ch'ai inquired.
"You ask for fresh ginger, soy and all these condiments, so I indent foran iron kettle for you to cook the paints and eat them." Tai-yueanswered, to the intense merriment of one and all, who gave way tolaughter.
"What do you, P'in Erh, know about these things?" Pao-ch'ai laughed. "Iam not certain in my mind that you won't put those coarse colouredplates straightway on the fire. But unless you take the precautionbeforehand of rubbing the bottom with ginger juice, mixed with soy, andof warming them dry, they're bound to crack, the moment they experiencethe least heat."
"It's really so," they exclaimed with one voice, after this explanation.
Tai-yue perused the list for a while. She then smiled and gave T'an Ch'una tug. "Just see," she whispered, "we want to paint a picture, and shegoes on indenting for a number of water jars and boxes! But, I presume,she's got so muddled, that she inserts a list of articles needed for hertrousseau."
T'an Ch'un, at her remark, laughed with such heartiness, that it was allshe could do to check herself. "Cousin Pao," she observed, "don't youwring her mouth? Just ask her what disparaging things she said aboutyou."
"Why need I ask?" Pao-ch'ai smiled. "Is it likely, pray, that you canget ivory out of a cur's mouth?"
Speaking the while, she drew near, and, seizing Tai-yue, she pressed herdown on the stove-couch with the intention of pinching her face. Tai-yuesmilingly hastened to implore for grace. "My dear cousin," she cried,"spare me! P'in Erh is young in years; all she knows is to talk atrandom; she has no idea of what's proper and what's improper. But youare my elder cousin, so teach me how to behave. If you, cousin, don'tlet me off, to whom can I go and address my entreaties?"
Little did, however, all who heard her apprehend that there lurked somehidden purpose in her insinuations. "She's right there," theyconsequently pleaded smilingly. "So much is she to be pitied that evenwe have been mollified; do spare her and finish!"
Pao-ch'ai had, at first, meant to play with her, but when she unawaresheard her drag in again the advice she had tendered her the other day,with regard to the reckless perusal of unwholesome books, she at oncefelt as if she could not have any farther fuss with her, and she let herrise to her feet.
"It's you, after all, elder cousin," Tai-yue laughed. "Had it been I, Iwouldn't have let any one off."
Pao-ch'ai smiled and pointed at her. "It is no wonder," she said, "thatour dear ancestor doats on you and that every one loves you. Even I haveto-day felt my heart warm towards you! But come here and let me put yourhair up for you!"
Tai-yue then, in very deed, swung herself round and crossed over to her.Pao-ch'ai arranged her coiffure with her hands. Pao-yue, who stood by andlooked on, thought the style, in which her hair was being made up,better than it was before. But, of a sudden, he felt sorry at what hadhappened, as he fancied that she should not have let her brush her sidehair, but left it alone for the time being and asked him to do it forher. While, however, he gave way to these erratic thoughts, he heardPao-ch'ai speak. "We've done with what there was to write," she said,"so you'd better tomorrow go and tell grandmother about the things. Ifthere be any at home, well and good; but if not, get some money to buythem with. I'll then help you both in your preparations."
Pao-yue vehemently put the list away; after which, they all joined in afurther chat on irrelevant matters; and, their evening meal over, theyonce more repaired into old lady Chia's apartments to wish hergood-night. Their grandmother had, indeed, had nothing serious thematter with her. Her ailment had amounted mainly to fatigue, to which aslight chill had been super-added, so that having kept in the warm roomfor the day and taken a dose or two of medicine, she entirely got overthe effects, and felt, in the evening, quite like own self again.
But, reader, the occurrences of the next day areas yet a mystery to you,but the nest chapter will divulge them.

CHAPTER XLIII.
  Having time to amuse themselves, the Chia inmates raise, when least      expected, funds to celebrate lady Feng's birthday.  In his ceaseless affection for Chin Ch'uen, Pao-yue uses, for the      occasion, a pinch of earth as incense and burns it.
When Madame Wang saw, for we will now proceed with our narrative, thatthe extent of dowager lady Chia's indisposition, contracted on the dayshe had been into the garden of Broad Vista, amounted to a simple chill,that no serious ailment had supervened, and that her health had improvedsoon after the doctor had been sent for and she had taken a couple ofdoses of medicine, she called lady Feng to her and asked her to getready a present of some kind for her to take to her husband, Chia Cheng.But while they were engaged in deliberation, they perceived awaiting-maid arrive. She came from their old senior's part to invitethem to go to her. So, with speedy step, Madame Wang led the way forlady Feng, and they came over into her quarters.
"Pray, may I ask," Madame Wang then inquired, "whether you're feelingnearly well again now?"
"I'm quite all right to-day," old lady Chia replied. "I've tasted theyoung-pheasant soup you sent me a little time back and find it full ofrelish. I've also had two pieces of meat, so I feel quite comfortablewithin me."
"These dainties were presented to you, dear ancestor, by that girlFeng," Madame Wang smiled. "It only shows how sincere her filial pietyis. She does not render futile the love, which you, venerable senior,ever lavish on her."
Dowager lady Chia nodded her head assentingly. "She's too kind to thinkof me!" she answered smiling. "But should there be any more uncooked,let them fry a couple of pieces; and, if these be thoroughly immersed inwine, the congee will taste well with them. The soup is, it's true,good, but it shouldn't, properly speaking, be prepared with fine rice."
After listening to her wishes, lady Feng expressed with alacrity herreadiness to see them executed, and directed a servant to go and deliverthe message in the cook-house.
"I sent the servant for you," dowager lady Chia meanwhile said to MadameWang with a smile, "not for anything else, but for the birthday of thatgirl Feng, which falls on the second. I had made up my mind two yearsago to celebrate her birthday in proper style, but when the time came,there happened to be again something important to attend to, and it wentby without anything being done. But this year, the inmates are, on onehand, all here, and there won't, I fancy, be, on the other, anything toprevent us, so we should all do our best to enjoy ourselves thoroughlyfor a day."
"I was thinking the same thing," Madame Wang rejoined, laughingly, "and,since it's your good pleasure, venerable senior, why, shouldn't wedeliberate at once and decide upon something?"
"To the best of my recollection," dowager lady Chia resumed smiling,"whenever in past years I've had any birthday celebrations for any oneof us, no matter who it was, we have ever individually sent ourrespective presents; but this method is common and is also apt, I think,to look very much as if there were some disunion. But I'll now devise anew way; a way, which won't have the effect of creating any discord, andwill be productive of good cheer."
"Let whatever way you may think best, dear ancestor, be adopted." MadameWang eagerly rejoined.
"My idea is," old lady Chia laughingly continued, "that we too shouldfollow the example of those poor families and raise a subscription amongourselves, and devote the whole of whatever we may collect to meet theoutlay for the necessary preparations. What do you say, will this do ornot?"
"This is a splendid idea!" Madame Wang acquiesced. "But what will, Iwonder, be the way adopted for raising contributions?"
Old lady Chia was the more inspirited by her reply. There and then shedespatched servants to go and invite Mrs. Hsueeh, Madame Hsing and therest of the ladies, and bade others summon the young ladies and Pao-yue.But from the other mansion, Chia Chen's spouse, Lai Ta's wife, even upto the wives of such stewards as enjoyed a certain amount ofrespectability, were likewise to be asked to come round.
The sight of their old mistress' delight filled the waiting-maids andmarried women with high glee as well; and each hurried with vehemence toexecute her respective errand. Those that were to be invited wereinvited, and those that had to be sent for were sent for; and, beforethe lapse of such time as could suffice to have a meal in, the old aswell as young, the high as well as low, crammed, in a black mass, everybit of the available space in the rooms.
Only Mrs. Hsueeh and dowager lady Chia sat opposite to each other.Mesdames Hsing and Wang simply seated themselves on two chairs, whichfaced the door of the apartment. Pao-ch'ai and her five or six cousinsoccupied the stove-couch. Pao-yue sat on his grandmother's lap. Below,the whole extent of the floor was crowded with inmates on their feet.But old lady Chia forthwith desired that a few small stools should befetched. When brought, these were proffered to Lai Ta's mother and someother nurses, who were advanced in years and held in respect; for it wasthe custom in the Chia mansion that the family servants, who had waitedupon any of the fathers or mothers, should enjoy a higher status thaneven young masters and mistresses. Hence it was that while Mrs. Yu, ladyFeng and other ladies remained standing below, Lai Ta's mother and threeor four other old nurses had, after excusing themselves for theirrudeness, seated themselves on small stools.
Dowager lady Chia recounted, with a face beaming with smiles, thesuggestions she had shortly made, for the benefit of the various inmatespresent; and one and all, of course, were only too ready to contributefor the entertainment. More, some of them, were on friendly terms withlady Feng, so they, of their own free will, adopted the proposal; otherslived in fear and trembling of lady Feng, and these were only tooanxious to make up to her. Every one, besides, could well afford themeans, so that, as soon as they heard of the proposed subscriptions,they, with one consent, signified their acquiescence.
"I'll give twenty taels!" old lady Chia was the first to say with asmile playing round her lips.
"I'll follow your lead, dear senior," Mrs. Hsueeh smiled, "and alsosubscribe twenty taels."
"We don't presume to place ourselves on an equal footing with yourladyship," Mesdames Hsing and Wang pleaded. "We, of course, come onedegree lower; each of us therefore will contribute sixteen taels."
"We too naturally rank one step lower," Mrs. Yu and Li Wan also smiled,"so we'll each give twelve taels."
"You're a widow," dowager lady Chia eagerly demurred, addressing herselfto Li Wan, "and have lost all your estate, so how could we drag you intoall this outlay! I'll contribute for you!"
"Don't be in such high feather dear senior," lady Feng hastily observedlaughing, "but just look to your accounts before you saddle yourselfwith this burden! You've already taken upon yourself two portions; anddo you now also volunteer sixteen taels on behalf of my eldersister-in-law? You may willingly do so, while you speak in the abundanceof your spirits, but when you, by and bye, come to ponder over whatyou've done, you'll feel sore at heart again! 'It's all that girl Fengthat's driven me to spend the money,' you'll say in a little time; andyou'll devise some ingenious way to inveigle me to fork out three orfour times as much as your share and thus make up your deficit in anunderhand way; while I will still be as much in the clouds as if I werein a dream!"
These words made every one laugh.
"According to you, what should be done?" dowager lady Chia laughinglyinquired.
"My birthday hasn't yet come," lady Feng smiled; "and already now I'vebeen the recipient of so much more than I deserve that I am quiteunhappy. But if I don't contribute a single cash, I shall feel reallyill at ease for the trouble I shall be giving such a lot of people. Itwould be as well, therefore, that I should bear this share of my seniorsister-in-law; and, when the day comes, I can eat a few more things, andthus be able to enjoy some happiness."
"Quite right!" cried Madame Hsing and the others at this suggestion. Soold lady Chia then signified her approval.
"There's something more I'd like to add," lady Feng pursued smiling. "Ithink that it's fair enough that you, worthy ancestor, should, besidesyour own twenty taels, have to stand two shares as well, the one forcousin Liu, the other for cousin Pao-yue, and that Mrs. Hsueeh should,beyond her own twenty taels, likewise bear cousin Pao-ch'ai's portion.But it's somewhat unfair that the two ladies Mesdames Hsing and Wangshould each only give sixteen taels, when their share is small, and whenthey don't subscribe anything for any one else. It's you, venerablesenior, who'll be the sufferer by this arrangement."
Dowager lady Chia, at these words, burst out into a boisterous fit oflaughter. "It's this hussey Feng," she observed, "who, after all, takesmy side! What you say is quite right. Hadn't it been for you, I wouldagain have been duped by them!"
"Dear senior!" lady Feng smiled. Just hand over our two cousins to thosetwo ladies and let each take one under her charge and finish. If youmake each contribute one share, it will be square enough."
"This is perfectly fair," eagerly rejoined old lady Chia. "Let thissuggestion be carried out!"
Lai Ta's mother hastily stood up. "This is such a subversion of right,"she smiled, "that I'll put my back up on account of the two ladies.She's a son's wife, on the other side, and, in here, only a wife'sbrother's child; and yet she doesn't incline towards her mother-in-lawand her aunt, but takes other people's part. This son's wife hastherefore become a perfect stranger; and a close niece has, in fact,become a distant niece!"
As she said this, dowager lady Chia and every one present began tolaugh. "If the junior ladies subscribe twelve taels each," Lai Ta'smother went on to ask, "we must, as a matter of course, also come onedegree lower; eh?"
Upon hearing this, old lady Chia remonstrated. "This won't do!" sheobserved. "You naturally should rank one degree lower, but you're all, Iam well aware, wealthy people; and, in spite of your status beingsomewhat lower, your funds are more flourishing than theirs. It's onlyjust then that you should be placed on the same standing as thosepeople!"
The posse of nurses expressed with promptness their acceptance of theproposal their old mistress made.
"The young ladies," dowager lady Chia resumed, "should merely givesomething for the sake of appearances! If each one contributes a sumproportionate to her monthly allowance, it will be ample!" Turning herhead, "Yuean Yang!" she cried, "a few of you should assemble in likemanner, and consult as to what share you should take in the matter. Sobring them along!"
Yuean Yang assured her that her desires would be duly attended to andwalked away. But she had not been absent for any length of time, whenshe appeared on the scene along with P'ing Erh, Hsi Jen, Ts'ai Hsia andother girls, and a number of waiting-maids as well. Of these, somesubscribed two taels; others contributed one tael.
"Can it be," dowager lady Chia then said to P'ing Erh, "that you don'twant any birthday celebrated for your mistress, that you don't rangeyourself also among them?"
"The other money I gave," P'ing Erh smiled, "I gave privately, and isextra." "This is what I am publicly bound to contribute along with thelot."
"That's a good child!" lady Chia laughingly rejoined.
"Those above as well as those below have all alike given their share,"lady Feng went on to observe with a smile. "But there are still thosetwo secondary wives; are they to give anything or not? Do go and askthem! It's but right that we should go to the extreme length and includethem. Otherwise, they'll imagine that we've looked down upon them!"
"Just so!" eagerly answered lady Chia, at these words. "How is it thatwe forgot all about them? The only thing is, I fear, they've got no timeto spare; yet, tell a servant-girl to go and ask them what they'll do!"
While she spoke, a servant-girl went off. After a long absence, shereturned. "Each of them," she reported, "will likewise contribute twotaels."
Dowager lady Chia was delighted with the result. "Fetch a pen andinkslab," she cried, "and let's calculate how much they amount to, alltogether."
Mrs. Yu abused lady Feng in a low tone of voice. "I'll take you, youmean covetous creature, and ... ! All these mothers-in-law andsisters-in-law have come forward and raised money to celebrate yourbirthday, and are you yet not satisfied that you must also drag in thosetwo miserable beings! But what do you do it for?"
"Try and talk less trash!" lady Feng smiled; also in an undertone."We'll be leaving this place in a little time and then I'll square upaccounts with you! But why ever are those two miserable? When they havemoney, they uselessly give it to other people; and isn't it better thatwe should get hold of it, and enjoy ourselves with it?"
While she uttered these taunts, they computed that the collections wouldreach a sum over and above one hundred and fifty taels.
"We couldn't possibly run through all this for a day's theatricals andbanquet!" old lady Chia exclaimed.
"As no outside guests are to be invited," Mrs. Yu interposed, "and thenumber of tables won't also be many, there will be enough to cover twoor three days' outlay! First of all, there won't be anything to spendfor theatricals, so we'll effect a saving on that item."
"Just call whatever troupe that girl Feng may say she likes best,"dowager lady Chia suggested.
"We've heard quite enough of the performances of that company of ours,"lady Feng said; "let's therefore spend a little money and send foranother, and see what they can do."
"I leave that to you, brother Chen's wife," old lady Chia pursued, "inorder that our girl Feng should have occasion to trouble her mind withas little as possible, and be able to enjoy a day's peace and quiet.It's only right that she should."
Mrs. Yu replied that she would be only too glad to do what she could.They then prolonged their chat for a little longer, until one and allrealised that their old senior must be quite fagged out, and theygradually dispersed.
After seeing Mesdames Hsing and Wang off, Mrs. Yu and the other ladiesadjourned into lady Feng's rooms to consult with her about the birthdayfestivities.
"Don't ask me!" lady Feng urged. "Do whatever will please our worthyancestor."
"What a fine thing you are to come across such a mighty piece of luck!"Mrs. Yu smiled. "I was wondering what had happened that she summoned usall! Why, was it simply on this account? Not to breathe a word about themoney that I'll have to contribute, must I have trouble and annoyance tobear as well? How will you show me any thanks?"
"Don't bring shame upon yourself!" lady Feng laughed. "I didn't send foryou; so why should I be thankful to you! If you funk the exertion, go atonce and let our venerable senior know, and she'll depute some one elseand have done."
"You go on like this as you see her in such excellent spirits, that'swhy!" Mrs. Yu smilingly answered. "It would be well, I advise you, topull in a bit; for if you be too full of yourself, you'll get your duereward!"
After some further colloquy, these two ladies eventually parted company.
On the next day, the money was sent over to the Ning Kuo Mansion at thevery moment that Mrs. Yu had got up, and was performing her toilette andablutions. "Who brought it?" she asked.
"Nurse Lin," the servant-girl said by way of response.
"Call her in," Mrs. Yu said.
The servant-girls walked as far as the lower rooms and called LinChih-hsiao's wife to come in. Mrs. Yu bade her seat herself on thefootstool. While she hurriedly combed her hair and washed her face andhands, she wanted to know how much the bundle contained in all.
"This is what's subscribed by us servants." Lin Chih-hsiao's wifereplied, "and so I collected it and brought it over first. As for thecontributions of our venerable mistress, and those of the ladies, theyaren't ready yet."
But simultaneously with this reply, the waiting-maids announced: "Ourlady of the other mansion and Mrs. Hsueeh have sent over some one withtheir portions."
"You mean wenches!" Mrs. Yu cried, scolding them with a smile. "All thegumption you've got is to simply bear in mind this sort of nonsense! Ina fit of good cheer, your old mistress yesterday purposely expressed awish to imitate those poor people, and raise a subscription. But you atonce treasured it up in your memory, and, when the thing came to becanvassed by you, you treated it in real earnest! Don't you yet quickbundle yourselves out, and bring the money in! Be careful and give themsome tea before you see them off."
The waiting-maids smilingly hastened to go and take delivery of themoney and bring it in. It consisted, in all, of two bundles, andcontained Pao-ch'ai's and Tai-yue's shares as well.
"Whose shares are wanting?" Mrs. Yu asked.
"Those of our old lady, of Madame Wang, the young ladies, and of ourgirls below are still missing," Lin Chih-hsiao's wife explained.
"There's also that of your senior lady," Mrs. Yu proceeded.
"You'd better hurry over, my lady," Lin Chih-hsiao's wife said; "for asthis money will be issued through our mistress Secunda, she'll nobblethe whole of it."
While conversing, Mrs. Yu finished arranging her coiffure and performingher ablutions; and, giving orders to see that the carriage was gotready, she shortly arrived at the Jung mansion. First and foremost shecalled on lady Feng. Lady Feng, she discovered, had already put themoney into a packet, and was on the point of sending it over.
"Is it all there?" Mrs. Yu asked.
"Yes, it is," lady Feng smiled, "so you might as well take it away atonce; for if it gets mislaid, I've nothing to do with it."
"I'm somewhat distrustful," Mrs. Yu laughed, "so I'd like to check it inyour presence."
These words over, she verily checked sum after sum. She found Li Wan'sshare alone wanting. "I said that you were up to tricks!" laughinglyobserved Mrs. Yu. "How is it that your elder sister-in-law's isn'there?"
"There's all that money; and isn't it yet enough?" lady Feng smiled. "Ifthere's merely a portion short it shouldn't matter! Should the moneyprove insufficient, I can then look you up, and give it to you."
"When the others were present yesterday," Mrs. Yu pursued, "you wereready enough to act as any human being would; but here you're againto-day prevaricating with me! I won't, by any manner of means, agree tothis proposal of yours! I'll simply go and ask for the money of ourvenerable senior."
"I see how dreadful you are!" lady Feng laughed. "But when somethingturns up by and bye, I'll also be very punctilious; so don't you thenbear me a grudge!"
"Well, never mind if you don't give your quota!" Mrs. Yu smilinglyrejoined. "Were it not that I consider the dutiful attentions you've allalong shown me would I ever be ready to humour you?"
So rejoining, she produced P'ing Erh's share. "P'ing Erh, come here,"she cried, "take this share of yours and put it away! Should the moneycollected turn out to be below what's absolutely required, I'll make upthe sum for you."
P'ing Erh apprehended her meaning. "My lady," she answered, with acheerful countenance, "it would come to the same thing if you were tofirst spend what you want and to give me afterwards any balance that mayremain of it."
"Is your mistress alone to be allowed to do dishonest acts," Mrs. Yulaughed, "and am I not to be free to bestow a favour?"
P'ing Erh had no option, but to retain her portion.
"I want to see," Mrs. Yu added, "where your mistress, who is soextremely careful, will run through all the money, we've raised! If shecan't spend it, why she'll take it along with her in her coffin, andmake use of it there."
While still speaking, she started on her way to dowager lady Chia'ssuite of rooms. After first paying her respects to her, she made a fewgeneral remarks, and then betook herself into Yuean Yang's quarters whereshe held a consultation with Yuean Yang. Lending a patient ear to allthat Yuean Yang; had to recommend in the way of a programme, and as tohow best to give pleasure to old lady Chia, she deliberated with heruntil they arrived at a satisfactory decision. When the time came forMrs. Yu to go, she took the two taels, contributed by Yuean Yang, andgave them back to her. "There's no use for these!" she said, and withthese words still on her lips, she straightway quitted her presence andwent in search of Madame Wang.
After a short chat, Madame Wang stepped into the family shrine reservedfor the worship of Buddha, so she likewise restored Ts'ai Yuen's share toher; and, availing herself of lady Feng's absence, she presentlyreimbursed to Mrs. Chu and Mrs. Chao the amount of their respectivecontributions.
These two dames would not however presume to take their money back."Your lot, ladies, is a pitiful one!" Mrs. Yu then expostulated. "Howcan you afford all this spare money! That hussey Feng is well aware ofthe fact. I'm here to answer for you!"
At these assurances, both put the money away, with profuse expressionsof gratitude.
In a twinkle, the second day of the ninth moon arrived. The inmates ofthe garden came to find out that Mrs. Yu was making preparations on anextremely grand scale; for not only was there to be a theatricalperformance, but jugglers and women storytellers as well; and theycombined in getting everything ready that could conduce to affordamusement and enjoyment.
"This is," Li Wan went on to say to the young ladies, "the proper dayfor our literary gathering, so don't forget it. If Pao-yue hasn'tappeared, it must, I presume, be that his mind is so preoccupied withthe fuss that's going on that he has lost sight of all pure and refinedthings."
Speaking, "Go and see what he is up to!" she enjoined a waiting-maid;"and be quick and tell him to come."
The waiting-maid returned after a long absence. "Sister Hua says," shereported, "that he went out of doors, soon after daylight this morning."
The result of the inquiries filled every one with surprise. "He can'thave gone out!" they said. "This girl is stupid, and doesn't know how tospeak." They consequently also directed Ts'ui Mo to go and ascertain thetruth. In a little time, Ts'ui Mo returned. "It's really true," sheexplained, "that he has gone out of doors. He gave out that a friend ofhis was dead, and that he was going to pay a visit of condolence."
"There's certainly nothing of the kind," T'an Ch'un interposed. "Butwhatever there might have been to call him away, it wasn't right of himto go out on an occasion like the present one! Just call Hsi Jen here,and let me ask her!"
But just as she was issuing these directions, she perceived Hsi Jenappear on the scene. "No matter what he may have had to attend toto-day," Li Wan and the rest remarked, "he shouldn't have gone out! Inthe first place, it's your mistress Secunda's birthday, and our dowagerlady is in such buoyant spirits that the various inmates, whether highor low, are coming from either mansion to join in the fun; and lo, hegoes off! Secondly, this is the proper day as well for holding our firstliterary gathering, and he doesn't so as apply for leave, but stealthilysneaks away."
Hsi Jen heaved it sigh. "He said last night," she explained, "that hehad something very important to do this morning; that he was going asfar as Prince Pei Ching's mansion, but that he would hurry back. Iadvised him not to go; but, of course, he wouldn't listen to me. When hegot out of bed, at daybreak this morning, he asked for his plain clothesand put them on, so, I suppose, some lady of note belonging to thehousehold of Prince Pei Ching must have departed this life; but who cantell?"
"If such be truly the case," Li Wan and her companions exclaimed, "it'squite right that he should have gone over for a while; but he shouldhave taken care to be back in time !"
This remark over, they resumed their deliberations. "Let's write ourverses," they said, "and we can fine him on his return."
As these words were being spoken, they espied a messenger despatched bydowager lady Chia to ask them over, so they at once adjourned to thefront part of the compound.
Hsi Jen then reported to his grandmother what Pao-yue had done. Old ladyChia was upset by the news; so much so, that she issued immediate ordersto a few servants to go and fetch him.
Pao-yue had, in fact, been brooding over some affair of the heart. A dayin advance he therefore gave proper injunctions to Pei Ming. "As I shallbe going out of doors to-morrow at daybreak," he said, "you'd better getready two horses and wait at the back door! No one else need follow asan escort! Tell Li Kuei that I've gone to the Pei mansion. In the eventof any one wishing to start in search of me, bid him place everyobstacle in the way, as all inquiries can well be dispensed with! Lethim simply explain that I've been detained in the Pei mansion, but thatI shall surely be back shortly."
Pei Ming could not make out head or tail of what he was driving at; buthe had no alternative than to deliver his message word for word. At thefirst blush of morning of the day appointed, he actually got ready twohorses and remained in waiting at the back gate. When daylight set in,he perceived Pao-yue make his appearance from the side door; got up, fromhead to foot, in a plain suit of clothes. Without uttering a word, hemounted his steed; and stooping his body forward, he proceeded at aquick step on his way down the road. Pei Ming had no help but to followsuit; and, springing on his horse, he smacked it with his whip, andovertook his master. "Where are we off to?" he eagerly inquired, frombehind.
"Where does this road lead to?" Pao-yue asked.
"This is the main road leading out of the northern gate." Pei Mingreplied. "Once out of it, everything is so dull and dreary that there'snothing worth seeing!"
Pao-yue caught this answer and nodded his head. "I was just thinking thata dull and dreary place would be just the thing!" he observed. Whilespeaking, he administered his steed two more whacks. The horse quicklyturned a couple of corners, and trotted out of the city gate. Pei Mingwas more and more at a loss what to think of the whole affair; yet hisonly course was to keep pace closely in his master's track. With onegallop, they covered a distance of over seven or eight lis. But it wasonly when human habitations became gradually few and far between thatPao-yue ultimately drew up his horse. Turning his head round: "Is thereany place here," he asked, "where incense is sold?"
"Incense!" Pei Ming shouted, "yes, there is; but what kind of incense itis I don't know."
"All other incense is worth nothing," Pao-yue resumed, after a moment'sreflection. "We should get sandalwood, conifer and cedar, these three."
"These three sorts are very difficult to get," Pei Ming smiled.
Pao-yue was driven to his wits' ends. But Pei Ming noticing his dilemma,"What do you want incense for?" he felt impelled to ask. "MasterSecundus, I've often seen you wear a small purse, about your person,full of tiny pieces of incense; and why don't you see whether you've gotit with you?"
This allusion was sufficient to suggest the idea to Pao-yue's mind.Forthwith, he drew back his hand and felt the purse suspended on thelapel of his coat. It really contained two bits of 'Ch'en Su.' At thisdiscovery, his heart expanded with delight. The only thing that (dampedhis spirits) was the notion that there was a certain want of reverencein his proceedings; but, on second consideration, he concluded that whathe had about him was, after all, considerably superior to any he couldpurchase, and, with alacrity, he went on to inquire about a censer andcharcoal.
"Don't think of such things!" Pei Ming urged. "Where could they beprocured in a deserted and lonely place like this? If you needed them,why didn't you speak somewhat sooner, and we could have brought themalong with us? Would not this have been more convenient?"
"You stupid thing!" exclaimed Pao-yue. "Had we been able to bring themalong, we wouldn't have had to run in this way as if for life!"
Pei Ming indulged in a protracted reverie, after which, he gave a smile."I've thought of something," he cried, "but I wonder what you'll thinkabout it, Master Secundus! You don't, I expect, only require thesethings; you'll need others too, I presume. But this isn't the place forthem; so let's move on at once another couple of lis, when we'll get tothe 'Water Spirit' monastery."
"Is the 'Water Spirit' monastery in this neighbourhood?" Pao-yue eagerlyinquired, upon hearing his proposal. "Yes, that would be better; let'spress forward."
With this reply, he touched his horse with his whip. While advancing ontheir way, he turned round. "The nun in this 'Water Spirit' monastery,"he shouted to Pei Ming, "frequently comes on a visit to our house, sothat when we now get there and ask her for the loan of a censer, she'scertain to let us have it."
"Not to mention that that's a place where our family burns incense," PeiMing answered, "she could not dare to raise any objections, to anyappeal from us for a loan, were she even in a temple quite unknown tous. There's only one thing, I've often been struck with the strongdislike you have for this 'Water Spirit' monastery, master, and how isthat you're now, so delighted with the idea of going to it?"
"I've all along had the keenest contempt for those low-bred persons,"Pao-yue rejoined, "who, without knowing why or wherefore, foolishly offersacrifices to the spirits, and needlessly have temples erected. Thereason of it all is, that those rich old gentlemen and unsophisticatedwealthy women, who lived in past days, were only too ready, the momentthey heard of the presence of a spirit anywhere, to take in hand theerection of temples to offer their sacrifices in, without even havingthe faintest notion whose spirits they were. This was because theyreadily credited as gospel-truth such rustic stories and idle tales aschanced to reach their ears. Take this place as an example. Offeringsare presented in this 'Water Spirit' nunnery to the spirit of the 'Lo'stream; hence the name of 'Water Spirit' monastery has been given to it.But people really don't know that in past days, there was no such thingas a 'Lo' spirit! These are, indeed, no better than legendary yarnsinvented by Ts'ao Tzu-chien, and who would have thought it, this sort ofstupid people have put up images of it, to which they offer oblations.It serves, however, my purpose to-day, so I'll borrow of her whatever Ineed to use."
While engaged in talking, they reached the entrance. The old nun sawPao-yue arrive, and was thoroughly taken aback. So far was this visitbeyond her expectations, that well did it seem to her as if a livedragon had dropped from the heavens. With alacrity, she rushed up tohim; and making inquiries after his health, she gave orders to an oldTaoist to come and take his horse.
Pao-yue stepped into the temple. But without paying the least homage tothe image of the 'Lo' spirit, he simply kept his eyes fixed intently onit; for albeit made of clay, it actually seemed, nevertheless, toflutter as does a terror-stricken swan, and to wriggle as a dragon inmotion. It looked like a lotus, peeping its head out of the greenstream, or like the sun, pouring its rays upon the russet clouds in theearly morn. Pao-yue's tears unwittingly trickled down his cheeks.
The old nun presented tea. Pao-yue then asked her for the loan of acenser to burn incense in. After a protracted absence, the old nunreturned with some incense as well as several paper horses, which shehad got ready for him to offer. But Pao-yue would not use any of thethings she brought. "Take the censer," he said to Pei Ming, "and go outinto the back garden and find a clean spot!"
But having been unable to discover one; "What about, the platform roundthat well?" Pei Ming inquired.
Pao-yue nodded his head assentingly. Then along with him, he repaired tothe platform of the well. He deposited the censer on the ground, whilePei Ming stood on one side. Pao-yue produced the incense, and threw it onthe fire. With suppressed tears, he performed half of the ceremony, and,turning himself round, he bade Pei Ming clear the things away. Pei Mingacquiesced; but, instead of removing the things, he speedily fell on hisface, and made several prostrations, as his lips uttered this prayer:"I, Pei Ming, have been in the service of Master Secundus for severalyears. Of the secrets of Mr. Secundus' heart there are none, which Ihave not known, save that with regard to this sacrifice to-day; theobject of which, he has neither told me; nor have I had the presumptionto ask. But thou, oh spirit! who art the recipient of these sacrificialofferings, must, I expect, unknown though thy surname and name be to me,be a most intelligent and supremely beautiful elder or younger sister,unique among mankind, without a peer even in heaven! As my MasterSecundus cannot give vent to the sentiments, which fill his heart, allowme to pray on his behalf! Should thou possess spirituality, and holinessbe thy share, do thou often come and look up our Mr. Secundus, forpersistently do his thoughts dwell with thee! And there is no reason whythou should'st not come! But should'st thou be in the abode of the dead,grant that our Mr. Secundus too may, in his coming existence, betransformed into a girl, so that he may be able to amuse himself withyou all! And will not this prove a source of pleasure to both sides?"
At the close of his invocation, he again knocked his head several timeson the ground, and, eventually, rose to his feet.
Pao-yue lent an ear to his utterances, but, before they had been broughtto an end, he felt it difficult to repress himself from laughing. Givinghim a kick, "Don't talk such stuff and nonsense!" he shouted. "Were anylooker-on to overhear what you say, he'd jeer at you!"
Pei Ming got up and put the censer away. While he walked along withPao-yue, "I've already," he said, "told the nun that you hadn't as yethad anything to eat, Master Secundus, and I bade her get a few thingsready for you, so you must force yourself to take something. I know verywell that a grand banquet will be spread in our mansion to-day, thatexceptional bustle will prevail, and that you have, on account of this,Sir, come here to get out of the way. But as you're, after all, going tospend a whole day in peace and quiet in here, you should try and divertyourself as best you can. It won't, therefore, by any manner of means dofor you to have nothing to eat."
"I won't be at the theatrical performance to have any wine," Pao-yueremarked, "so what harm will there be in my having a drink here, as thefancy takes me?"
"Quite so!" rejoined Pei Ming. "But there's another consideration. Youand I have run over here; but there must be some whose minds are ill atease. Were there no one uneasy about us, well, what would it matter ifwe got back into town as late as we possibly could? But if there be anysolicitous on your account, it's but right, Master Secundus, that youshould enter the city and return home. In the first place, our worthyold mistress and Madame Wang, will thus compose their minds; andsecondly, you'll observe the proper formalities, if you succeed in doingnothing else. But even supposing that, when once you get home, you feelno inclination to look at the plays and have anything to drink, you canmerely wait upon your father and mother, and acquit yourself of yourfilial piety! Well, if it's only a matter of fulfilling this obligation,and you don't care whether our old mistress and our lady, your mother,experience concern or not, why, the spirit itself, which has just beenthe recipient of your oblations, won't feel in a happy frame of mind!You'd better therefore, master, ponder and see what you think of mywords!"
"I see what you're driving at!" Pao-yue smiled. "You keep before yourmind the thought that you're the only servant, who has followed me as anattendant out of town, and you give way to fear that you will, on yourreturn, have to bear the consequences. You hence have recourse to thesegrandiloquent arguments to shove words of counsel down my throat! I'vecome here now with the sole object of satisfying certain rites, and thengoing to partake of the banquet and be a spectator of the plays; and Inever mentioned one single word about any intention on my part not to goback to town for a whole day! I've, however, already accomplished thewish I fostered in my heart, so if we hurry back to town, so as toenable every one to set their solicitude at rest, won't the rightprinciple be carried out to the full in one respect as well as another?"
"Yes, that would be better!" exclaimed Pei Ming.
Conversing the while, they wended their way into the Buddhistic hall.Here the nun had, in point of fact, got ready a table with lentenviands. Pao-yue hurriedly swallowed some refreshment and so did Pei Ming;after which, they mounted their steeds and retraced their stepshomewards, by the road they had come.
Pei Ming followed behind. "Master Secundus!" he kept on shouting, "becareful how you ride! That horse hasn't been ridden very much, so holdhim in tight a bit."
As he urged him to be careful, they reached the interior of the citywalls, and, making their entrance once more into the mansion by the backgate, they betook themselves, with all possible despatch, into the IHung court. Hsi Jen and the other maids were not at home. Only a few oldwomen were there to look after the rooms. As soon as they saw himarrive, they were so filled with gratification that their eyebrowsdilated and their eyes smiled. "O-mi-to-fu!" they said laughingly,"you've come! You've all but driven Miss Hua mad from despair! In theupper quarters, they're just seated at the feast, so be quick, Mr.Secundus, and go and join them."
At these words, Pao-yue speedily divested himself of his plain clothesand put on a coloured costume, reserved for festive occasions, which hehunted up with his own hands. This done, "Where are they holding thebanquet?" he inquired.
"They're in the newly erected large reception pavilion," the old womenresponded.
Upon catching their reply, Pao-yue straightway started for thereception-pavilion. From an early moment, the strains of flageolets andpipes, of song and of wind-instruments faintly fell on his ear. Themoment he reached the passage on the opposite side, he discerned YueCh'uan-erh seated all alone under the eaves of the verandah giving wayto tears. As soon as she became conscious of Pao-yue's arrival, she drewa long, long breath. Smacking her lips, "Ai!" she cried, "the phoenixhas alighted! go in at once! Hadn't you come for another minute, everyone would have been quite upset!"
Pao-yue forced a smile. "Just try and guess where I've been?" heobserved.
Yue Ch'uan-erh twisted herself round, and, paying no notice to him, shecontinued drying her tears. Pao-yue had, therefore, no option but toenter with hasty step. On his arrival in the reception-hall, he paid hisgreetings to his grandmother Chia, to Madame Wang, and the otherinmates, and one and all felt, in fact, as happy to see him back as ifthey had come into the possession of a phoenix.
"Where have you been," dowager lady Chia was the first to ask, "that youcome back at this hour? Don't you yet go and pay your congratulations toyour cousin?" And smiling she proceeded, addressing herself to ladyFeng, "Your cousin has no idea of what's right and what's wrong. Eventhough he may have had something pressing to do, why didn't he utterjust one word, but stealthily bolted away on his own hook? Will thissort of thing ever do? But should you behave again in this fashion byand bye, I shall, when your father comes home, feel compelled to tellhim to chastise you."
Lady Feng smiled. "Congratulations are a small matter?" she observed."But, cousin Pao, you must, on no account, sneak away any more withoutbreathing a word to any one, and not sending for some people to escortyou, for carriages and horses throng the streets. First and foremost,you're the means of making people uneasy at heart; and, what's more,that isn't the way in which members of a family such as ours should goout of doors!"
Dowager lady Chia meanwhile went on reprimanding the servants, whowaited on him. "Why," she said, "do you all listen to him and readily gowherever he pleases without even reporting a single word? But where didyou really go?" Continuing, she asked, "Did you have anything to eat? Ordid you get any sort of fright, eh?"
"A beloved wife of the duke of Pei Ching departed this life," Pao-yuemerely returned for answer, "and I went to-day to express my condolencesto him. I found him in such bitter anguish that I couldn't very wellleave him and come back immediately. That's the reason why I tarriedwith him a little longer."
"If hereafter you do again go out of doors slyly and on your own hook,"dowager lady Chia impressed on his mind, "without first telling me, Ishall certainly bid your father give you a caning!"
Pao-yue signified his obedience with all promptitude. His grandmotherChia was then bent upon having the servants, who were on attendance onhim, beaten, but the various inmates did their best to dissuade her."Venerable senior!" they said, "you can well dispense with flying into arage! He has already promised that he won't venture to go out again.Besides, he has come back without any misadventure, so we should allcompose our minds and enjoy ourselves a bit!"
Old lady Chia had, at first, been full of solicitude. She had, as amatter of course, been in a state of despair and displeasure; but,seeing Pao-yue return in safety, she felt immoderately delighted, to sucha degree, that she could not reconcile herself to visit her resentmentupon him. She therefore dropped all mention of his escapade at once. Andas she entertained fears lest he may have been unhappy or have had, whenhe was away, nothing to eat, or got a start on the road, she did notpunish him, but had, contrariwise, recourse to every sort of inducementto coax him to feel at ease. But Hsi Jen soon came over and attended tohis wants, so the company once more turned their attention to thetheatricals. The play acted on that occasion was, "The record of theboxwood hair-pin." Dowager lady Chia, Mrs. Hsueeh and the others weredeeply impressed by what they saw and gave way to tears. Some, however,of the inmates were amused; others were provoked to anger; others gavevent to abuse.
But, reader, do you wish to know the sequel? If so, the next chapterwill explain it.

CHAPTER XLIV.
  By some inscrutable turn of affairs, lady Feng begins to feel the      pangs of jealousy.  Pao-yue experiences joy, beyond all his expectations, when P'ing Erh      (receives a slap from lady Feng) and has to adjust her hair.
But to resume our narrative. At the performance of the 'Record of theboxwood hairpin,' at which all the inmates of the household werepresent, Pao-yue and his female cousins sat together. When Lin Tai-yuenoticed that the act called, 'The man offers a sacrifice' had beenreached, "This Wang Shih-p'eng," she said to Pao-ch'ai, "is very stupid!It would be quite immaterial where he offered his sacrifices, and whymust he repair to the riverside? 'At the sight of an object,' theproverb has it, 'one thinks of a person. All waters under the heavensrevert but to one source.' So had he baled a bowlful from any stream,and given way to his lamentations, while gazing on it, he could verywell have satisfied his feelings."
Pao-ch'ai however made no reply.
Pao-yue then turned his head round and asked for some warm wine to drinkto lady Feng's health. The fact is, that dowager lady Chia had enjoinedon them that this occasion was unlike others, and that it was absolutelynecessary for them to do the best to induce lady Feng to heartily enjoyherself for the day. She herself, nevertheless, felt too listless tojoin the banquet, so simply reclining on a sofa of the inner room, shelooked at the plays in company with Mrs. Hsueeh; and choosing severalkinds of such eatables as were to her taste, she placed them on a smallteapoy, and now helped herself to some, and now talked, as the fancytook her. Then allotting what viands were served on the two tablesassigned to her to the elder and younger waiting-maids, for whom nocovers were laid, and to those female servants and other domestics, whowere on duty and had to answer calls, she urged them not to mind but toseat themselves outside the windows, under the eaves of the verandahs,and to eat and drink at their pleasure, without any regard toconventionalities. Madame Wang and Madame Hsing occupied places at thehigh table below; while round several tables outside sat the posse ofyoung ladies.
"Do let that girl Feng have the seat of honour," old lady Chia shortlytold Mrs. Yu and her contemporaries, "and mind be careful in doing thehonours for me, for she is subjected to endless trouble from one year'send to another!"
"Very well," said Mrs. Yu. "I fancy," she went on to smile, "that littleused as she is to filling the place of honour, she's bound, if she takesthe high seat, to be so much at a loss how to behave, as to be loth evento have any wine!"
Dowager lady Chia was much amused by her reply. "Well, if you can'tsucceed," she said, "wait and I'll come and offer it to her."
Lady Feng with hasty step walked into the inner room. "Venerableancestor!" she smiled, "don't believe all they tell you! I've alreadyhad several cups!"
"Quick, pull her out," old lady Chia laughingly cried to Mrs. Yu, "andshove her into a chair, and let all of you drink by turns to her health!If she then doesn't drink, I'll come myself in real earnest and make herhave some!"
At these words, Mrs. Yu speedily dragged her out, laughing the while,and forced her into a seat, and, directing a servant to fetch a cup, shefilled it with wine. "You've got from one year's end to another," shesmiled, "the trouble and annoyance of conferring dutiful attentions uponour venerable senior, upon Madame Wang and upon myself, so, as I'venothing to-day, with which to prove my affection for you, have a sip,from my hand, my own dear, of this cup of wine I poured for you myself!"
"If you deliberately wish to present me a glass," lady Feng laughed,"fall on your knees and I'll drink at once!"
"What's this you say?" Mrs. Yu replied with a laugh. "And who are you, Iwonder? But let me tell you this once for all and finish that thoughwe've succeeded, after ever so many difficulties, in getting up thisentertainment to-day, there's no saying whether we shall in the futurebe able to have anything more the like of this or not. Let's availourselves then of the present to put our capacity to the strain anddrink a couple of cups!"
Lady Feng saw very well that she could not advance any excuses, andnecessity obliged her to swallow the contents of two cups. In quicksuccession, however, the various young ladies also drew near her, andlady Feng was constrained again to take a sip from the cup each held.But nurse Lai Ta too felt compelled, at the sight of dowager lady Chiastill in buoyant spirits, to come forward and join in the merriment, soputting herself at the head of a number of nurses, she approached andproffered wine to lady Feng who found it once more so difficult torefuse that she had to swallow a few mouthfuls. But Yuean Yang and hercompanions next appeared, likewise, on the scene to hand her their shareof wine; but lady Feng felt, in fact, so little able to comply withtheir wishes, that she promptly appealed to them entreatingly. "Dearsisters," she pleaded, "do spare me! I'll drink some more to-morrow!"
"Quite so! we're a mean lot," Yuean Yang laughed. "But now that we standin the presence of your ladyship, do condescend to look upon usfavourably! We've always enjoyed some little consideration, and do youput on the airs of a mistress on an occasion like the present, whenthere's such a crowd of people standing by? Really, I shouldn't havecome. But, as you won't touch our wine, we might as well be quick andretire!"
While she spoke, she was actually walking away, when lady Feng hastenedto lay hold of her and to detain her. "Dear sister," she cried, "I'lldrink some and have done!"
So saying, she took the wine and filled a cup to the very brim, anddrained it. Yuean Yang then at length gave her a smile, (and she and herfriends) dispersed.
Subsequently, the company resumed their places at the banquet. But ladyFeng was conscious that the wine she had primed herself with wasmounting to her head, so abruptly staggering to the upper end, she meantto betake herself home to lie down, when seeing the jugglers arrive,"Get the tips ready!" she shouted to Mrs. Yu. "I'm off to wash my face abit."
Mrs. Yu nodded her head assentingly; and lady Feng, noticing that theinmates were off their guard, left the banquet, and wended her stepsbeneath the eaves towards the back entrance of the house. P'ing Erh had,however, been keeping her eye on her, so hastily she followed in herfootsteps. Lady Feng at once propped herself on her arm. But no soonerdid they reach the covered passage than she discerned a young maid,attached to her quarters, standing under it. (The girl), the moment sheperceived them, twisted herself round and beat a retreat. Lady Fengforthwith began to give way to suspicion; and she immediately shoutedout to her to halt. The maid pretended at first not to hear, but, as,while following her they called out to her time after time, she foundherself compelled to turn round. Lady Feng was seized with greaterdoubts than ever. Quickly therefore entering the covered passage withP'ing Erh, she bade the maid go along with them. Then opening a foldingscreen, lady Feng stated herself on the steps leading to the smallcourtyard, and made the girl fall on her knees. "Call two boy-servantsfrom among those on duty at the second gate," she cried out to P'ingErh, "to bring a whip of twisted cords, and to take this young wench,who has no regard for her mistress, and beat her to shreds."
The servant-maid fell into a state of consternation, and was scared outof her very wits. Sobbing the while, she kept on bumping her head on theground and soliciting for grace.
"I'm really no ghost! So you must have seen me! Don't you know what goodmanners mean and stand still?" lady Feng asked. "Why did you insteadpersist in running on?"
"I truly did not see your ladyship coming," the maid replied with tearsin her eyes. "I was, besides, much concerned as there was no one in therooms; that's why I was running on."
"If there's no one in the rooms, who told you to come out again?" ladyFeng inquired. "And didn't you see me, together with P'ing Erh, at yourheels, stretching out our necks and calling out to you about ten times?But the more we shouted, the faster you ran! You weren't far off from useither, so is it likely that you got deaf? And are you still bent uponbandying words with me?"
So speaking, she raised her hand and administered her a slap on theface. But, while the girl staggered from the blow, she gave her a secondslap on the other side of the face, so both cheeks of the maid quicklybegan to get purple and to swell.
P'ing Erh hastened to reason with her mistress. "My lady!" she said, "becareful you'll be hurting your hand!"
"Go on, pommel her," urged lady Feng, "and ask her what made her run!and, if she doesn't tell you, just you take her mouth and tear it topieces for her!"
At the outset, the girl obstinately prevaricated, but when sheeventually heard that lady Feng intended to take a red-hot branding-ironand burn her mouth with, she at last sobbingly spoke out. "Our MasterSecundus, Mr. Lien, is at home," she remarked, "and he sent me here towatch your movements, my lady; bidding me go ahead, when I saw you leavethe banquet, and convey the message to him. But, contrary to his hopes,your ladyship came back just now!"
Lady Feng saw very well that there lurked something behind all she said."What did he ask you to watch me for?" she therefore eagerly asked. "Canit be, pray, that he dreaded to see me return home? There must be someother reason; so be quick and tell it to me and I shall henceforwardtreat you with regard. If you don't minutely confess all to me, I shallthis very moment take a knife and pare off your flesh!"
Threatening her the while, she turned her head round, and, extracting ahairpin from her coiffure, she stuck it promiscuously about the maid'smouth. This so frightened the girl that, as she made every effort to getout of her way, she burst out into tears and entreaties. "I'll tell yourladyship everything," she cried, "but you mustn't say that it was I whotold you."
Ping Erh, who stood by, exhorted her to obey; but she at the same timeimpressed on her mind to speak out without delay.
"Mr. Secundus himself arrived only a few minutes back," the maid began."The moment, however, he came, he opened a bog, and, taking two piecesof silver, two hairpins, and a couple of rolls of silk, he bade mestealthily take them to Pao Erh's wife and tell her to come in. As soonas she put the things away, she hurried to our house, and MasterSecundus ordered me to keep an eye on your ladyship; but of whathappened after that, I've no idea whatever."
When these disclosures fell on lady Feng's ears, she flew into such arage that her whole person felt quite weak; and, rising immediately, shestraightway repaired home. The instant she reached the gate of thecourtyard, she espied a waiting-maid peep out of the entrance. Seeinglady Feng, she too drew in her head, and tried at once to effect herescape. But lady Feng called her by name, and made her stand still. Thisgirl had ever been very sharp, so when she realised that she could notmanage to beat a retreat, she went so far as to run out to her. "I wasjust going to tell your ladyship," she smiled, "and here you come! Whata strange coincidence!"
"Tell me what?" lady Feng exclaimed.
"That Mr. Secundus is at home," the girl replied, "and has done so andso." She then recounted to her all the incidents recorded a few minutesback.
"Ts'ui!" ejaculated lady Feng. "What were you up to before? Now, thatI've seen you, you come and try to clear yourself!"
As she spoke, she raised her arm and administered the maid a slap, whichupset her equilibrium. So with hurried step, she betook herself away.Lady Feng then drew near the window. Lending an ear to what was going oninside, she heard some one in the room laughingly observe: "When thatqueen-of-hell sort of wife of yours dies, it will be a good riddance!"
"When she's gone," Chia Lien rejoined, "and I marry another, the like ofher, what will I again do?"
"When she's dead and gone," the woman resumed, "just raise P'ing Erh tothe rank of primary wife. I think she'll turn out considerably betterthan she has."
"At present," Chia Lien put in, "she won't even let me enjoy P'ing Erh'ssociety! P'ing Erh herself is full of displeasure; yet she dares notspeak. How is it that it has been my fate to bring upon myself theinfluence of this evil star?"
Lady Feng overheard these criticisms and flew into a fit of anger, whichmade her tremble violently. When she, however, also caught the praiseheaped by both of them upon P'ing Erh, she harboured the suspicion thatP'ing Erh too must, as a matter of course, have all along employed thesly resentful language against her. And, as the wine bubbled up more andmore into her head, she did not so much as give the matter a secondthought, but, twisting round, she first and foremost gave P'ing Erh acouple of whacks, and, with one kick, she banged the door open, andwalked in. Then, without allowing her any time to give any explanationin her own defence, she clutched Pao Erh's wife, and, tearing her about,she belaboured her with blows. But the dread lest Chia Lien should slipout of the room, induced her to post herself in such a way as toobstruct the doorway. "What a fine wench!" she shouted out abusingly."You make a paramour of your mistress' husband, and then you wish tocompass your master's wife's death, for P'ing Erh to transfer herquarters in here! You base hirelings! You're all of the same stamp,thoroughly jealous of me; you try to cajole me by your outward display!"
While abusing them, she once more laid hold of P'ing Erh and beat herseveral times. P'ing Erh was pummelled away till her heart thrilled witha sense of injury, but she had nowhere to go, and breathe her woes. Suchresentment overpowered her feelings that she sobbed without a sign of atear. "You people," she railingly shouted, "go and do a lot of shamefulthings, and then you also deliberately involve me; but why?"
So shouting, she too clutched Pao Erh's wife and began to assail her.Chia Lien had freely primed himself with wine, so, on his return home,he was in such exuberance of spirits that he observed no secresy in hisdoings. The moment, however, he perceived lady Feng appear on the scene,he got to his wits' end. Yet when he saw P'ing Erh also start a rumpus,the liquor he had had aroused his ire. The sight of the assaultcommitted by lady Feng on Pao Erh's wife had already incensed him andput him to shame, but he had not been able with any consistency tointerfere; but the instant he espied P'ing Erh herself lay hands on her,he vehemently jumped forward and gave her a kick. "What a vixen!" hecried. "Are you likewise going to start knocking people about?"
P'ing Erh was of a timid disposition. At once, therefore, she withheldher hands, and melted into tears. "Why do you implicate me," she said,"in things you say behind my back?"
When lady Feng descried in what fear and dread P'ing Erh was of ChiaLien, she lost more than ever control over her temper, and, startingagain in pursuit of her, she struck P'ing Erh, while urging her to gofor Pao Erh's wife.
P'ing Erh was driven to exasperation; and forthwith rushing out of theapartment, she went in search of a knife to commit suicide with. But thecompany of old matrons, who stood outside, hastened to place impedimentsin her way, and to argue with her.
Lady Feng, meanwhile, realised that P'ing Erh had gone to take her life,and rolling, head foremost, into Chia Lien's embrace, "You put yourheads together to do me harm," she said, "and, when I overhear yourdesigns, you people conspire to frighten me! But strangle me and havedone."
Chia Lien was driven to despair; to such a degree that unsheathing asword suspended on the wall, "There's no need for any one of you tocommit suicide!" he screamed. "I too am thoroughly exasperated, so I'llkill the whole lot of you and pay the penalty with my own life! We'llall then be free from further trouble!"
The bustle had just reached a climax beyond the chance of a settlement,when they perceived Mrs. Yu and a crowd of inmates make their appearancein the room. "What's the matter?" they asked. "There was nothing up justnow, so why is all this row for?"
At the sight of the new arrivals, Chia Lien more than ever made thethree parts of intoxication, under which he laboured, an excuse toassume an air calculated to intimidate them, and to pretend, in order tofurther his own ends, that he was bent upon despatching lady Feng.
But lady Feng, upon seeing her relatives appear, got into a mood lessperverse than the one she had been in previous to their arrival; and,leaving the whole company of them, she scampered, all in tears, over tothe off side, into dowager lady Chia's quarters.
By this time, the play was over. Lady Feng rushed consequently into theold lady's presence and fell into her lap. "Venerable ancestor! helpme!" she exclaimed. "Mr. Chia Lien wishes to kill me."
"What's up?" precipitately inquired dowager lady Chia, Mesdames Hsingand Wang and the rest.
"I was just going to my rooms to change my dress," lady Feng wept, "whenI unexpectedly found Mr. Chia Lien at home, talking with some one.Fancying that visitors had come, I was quite taken aback, and notpresuming to enter, I remained outside the window and listened. Itturned out, in fact, to be Pao Erh's wife holding council with him. Shesaid that I was dreadful, and that she meant to poison me so as to getme out of the way and enable P'ing Erh to be promoted to be first wife.At this, I lost my temper. But not venturing, none the less, to have arow with him, I simply gave P'ing Erh two slaps; and then I asked himwhy he wished to do me harm. But so stricken did he get with shame thathe tried there and then to despatch me."
Dowager lady Chia treated every word that fell on her ear as truth."Dreadful!" she ejaculated. "Bring here at once that low-bredoffspring!"
Barely was, however, this exclamation out of her lips, than theyperceived Chia Lien, a sword in hand, enter in pursuit of his wife,followed closely by a bevy of inmates. Chia Lien evidently placed suchthorough reliance upon the love, which old lady Chia had all alonglavished upon them, that he entertained little regard even for hismother or his aunt, so he came, with perfect effrontery, to stir up adisturbance in their presence. When Mesdames Hsing and Wang saw him,they got into a passion, and, with all despatch, they endeavoured todeter him from his purpose. "You mean thing!" they shouted, abusing him."Your crime is more heinous, for our venerable senior is in here!"
"It's all because our worthy ancestor spoils her," cried Chia Lien, witheyes awry, "that she behaved as she did and took upon herself to rateeven me!"
Madame Hsing was full of resentment. Snatching the sword from his grasp,she kept on telling him to quit the room at once. But Chia Liencontinued to prattle foolish nonsense in a drivelling and maudlin way.His manner exasperated dowager lady Chia. "I'm well aware," sheobserved, "that you haven't the least consideration for any one of us.Tell some one to go and call his father here and we'll see whether hedoesn't clear out."
When Chia Lien caught these words, he eventually tottered out of theapartment. But in such a state of frenzy was he that he did not returnto his quarters, but betook himself into the outer study.
During this while, Mesdames Hsing and Wang also called lady Feng totask.
"Why, what serious matter could it ever have been?" old lady Chiaremarked. "But children of tender years are like greedy kittens, and howcan one say for certain that they won't do such things? Human beingshave, from their very infancy, to go through experiences of this kind!It's all my fault, however, for pressing you to have a little more winethan was good for you. But you've also gone and drunk the vinegar ofjealousy!"
This insinuation made every one laugh.
"Compose your mind!" proceeded dowager lady Chia. "To-morrow I'll sendfor him to apologise to you; but, you'd better to-day not go over, asyou might put him to shame!" Continuing, she also went on to abuse P'ingErh. "I've always thought highly of that wench," she said, "and how isit that she's turned out to be secretly so bad?"
"P'ing Erh isn't to blame!" Mrs. Yu and the others smiled. "It's ladyFeng who makes people her tools to give vent to her spite! Husband andwife could not very well come to blows face to face, so they combined inusing P'ing Erh as their scapegoat! What injuries haven't fallen toP'ing Erh's lot! And do you, venerable senior, still go on blowing herup?"
"Is it really so!" exclaimed old lady Chia. "I always said that thatgirl wasn't anything like that artful shrew! Well, in that case, she isto be pitied, for she has had to bear the brunt of her anger, and allthrough no fault of hers!" Calling Hu Po to her, "Go," she added, "andtell P'ing Erh all I enjoin you; 'that I know that she has been insultedand that to-morrow I'll send for her mistress to make amends, but thatbeing her mistress' birthday to-day, I won't have her give rise to anyreckless fuss'!"
P'ing Erh had, we may explain, from an early hour, been dragged by LiWan into the garden of Broad Vista. Here P'ing Erh gave way to bittertears. So much so, that her throat choked with sobs, and could not giveutterance to speech.
"You are an intelligent person," exhorted her Pao-ch'ai, "and howconsiderately has your lady treated you all along! It was simply becauseshe has had a little too much wine that she behaved as she did to-day!But had she not made you the means of giving vent to her spite, is itlikely that she could very well have aired her grievances upon any oneelse? Besides, any one else would have laughed at her for acting in asham way!"
While she reasoned with her, she saw Hu Po approach, and deliver dowagerlady Chia's message. P'ing Erh then felt in herself that she had comeout of the whole affair with some credit, and she, little by little,resumed her equilibrium. She did not, nevertheless, put her footanywhere near the front part of the compound.
After a little rest, Pao Ch'ai and her companions came and paid a visitto old lady Chia and lady Feng, while Pao-yue pressed P'ing Erh to cometo the I Hung court. Hsi Jen received her with alacrity. "I meant," shesaid, "to be the first to ask you, but as our senior lady, Chia Chu, andthe young ladies invited you, I couldn't very well do so myself."
P'ing Erh returned her smile. "Many thanks!" she rejoined. "How wordsever commenced between us;" she then went on, "when there was noprovocation, I can't tell! But without rhyme or reason, I came in for aspell of resentment."
"Our lady Secunda has always been very good to you," laughingly remarkedHsi Jen, "so she must have done this in a sudden fit of exasperation!"
"Our lady Secunda did not, after all, say anything to me," P'ing Erhexplained. "It was that wench that blew me up. And she deliberately madea laughing-stock of me. But that fool also of a master of ours struckme!"
While recounting her experiences, she felt a keener sense of injusticethan before, and she found it hard to restrain her tears from tricklingdown her cheeks.
"My dear sister," Pao-yue hastily advised her, "don't wound your heart!I'm quite ready to express my apologies on behalf of that pair!"
"What business is that of yours?" P'ing Erh smiled.
"We cousins, whether male or female, are all alike." Pao-yue smilinglyargued. "So when they hurt any one's feelings, I apologise for them;it's only right that I should do so. What a pity;" he continued, "thesenew clothes too have been stained! But you'll find your sister Hua'scostumes in here, and why don't you put one on, and take some hot wineand spurt it over yours and iron them out? You might also remake yourcoiffure."
Speaking, he directed the young maids to draw some water for washing theface and to heat an iron and bring it.
P'ing Erh had ever heard people maintain that all that Pao-yue excelledin was in knitting friendships with girls. But Pao-yue had so far beenloth, seeing that P'ing Erh was Chia Lien's beloved secondary wife, andlady Feng's confidante, to indulge in any familiarities with her. Andbeing precluded from accomplishing the desire upon which his heart wasset, he time and again gave way to vexation. When P'ing Erh, however,remarked his conduct towards her on this occasion, she secretly resolvedwithin herself that what was said of him was indeed no idle rumour. Butas he had anticipated every one of her wants, and she saw moreover thatHsi Jen had, for her special benefit, opened a box and produced twoarticles of clothing, not much worn by her, she speedily drew near andwashed her face.
Pao-yue stood by her side. "You must, dear girl, also apply a littlecosmetic and powder," she smiled; "otherwise you'll look as if you wereangry with lady Feng. It's her birthday, besides; and our old ancestorhas sent some one again to come and cheer you up."
Hearing how reasonable his suggestions were, P'ing Erh readily went insearch of powder; but she failed to notice any about, so Pao-yuehurriedly drew up to the toilet-table, and, removing the lid of aporcelain box made at the "Hsuean" kiln, which contained a set of tensmall ladles, tuberose-like in shape, (for helping one's self to powderwith), he drew out one of them and handed it to P'ing Erh. "This isn'tlead powder," he smiled. "This is made of the seeds of red jasmine, welltriturated, and compounded with suitable first class ingredients."
P'ing Erh emptied some on the palm of her hand. On examination, shereally found that it was light, clear, red and scented; perfect in allfour properties; that it was easy to apply evenly to the face, that itkept moist, and that it differed from other kinds of powder, ordinarilyso rough. She subsequently noticed that the cosmetic too was not spreadon a sheet, but that it was contained in a tiny box of white jade, thecontents of which bore the semblance of rose-paste.
"The cosmetic one buys in the market isn't clean;" Pao-yue remarkedsmilingly. "Its colour is faint as well. But this is cosmetic ofsuperior quality. The juice was squeezed out, strained clear, mixed withperfume of flowers and decocted. All you need do is to take some withthat hair-pin and rub it on your lips, that will be enough; and if youdissolve some in a little water, and rub it on the palm of your hand, itwill be ample for you to cover your whole face with."
P'ing Erh followed his directions and performed her toilette. She lookedexceptionally fresh and beautiful. A sweet fragrance pervaded hercheeks. Pao-yue then cut, with a pair of bamboo scissors, a stalk, withtwo autumn orchids, which had blossomed in a flower pot, and he pinnedit in her side-hair. But a maid was unexpectedly seen to enter the room,sent by Li Wan to come and call her, so she quitted his quarters withall possible despatch.
Pao-yue had not so far been able to have his wishes to revel in P'ingErh's society gratified. P'ing Erh was furthermore a girl of a highgrade, most intelligent, most winsome, and unlike that sort of vulgarand dull-minded beings, so that he cherished intense disgust against hisfate.
The present occasion had been the anniversary of Chin Ch'uan-erh'sbirth, and he had remained, in consequence, plunged in a disconsolateframe of mind throughout the whole day. But, contrary to hisexpectations, the incident eventually occurred, which afforded him,after all, an opportunity to dangle in P'ing Erh's society and togratify to some small degree a particle of his wish. This had been apiece of good fortune he so little expected would fall to his shareduring the course of his present existence, that as he reclined on hisbed, his heart swelled with happiness and contentment. Suddenly, hereflected that Chia Lien's sole thought was to make licentious pleasuresthe means of gratifying his passions, and that he had no idea how toshow the least regard to the fair sex; and he mused that P'ing Erh waswithout father or mother, brothers or sisters, a solitary being destinedto dance attendance upon a couple such as Chia Lien and his wife; thatChia Lien was vulgar, and lady Feng haughty, but that she was giftednevertheless with the knack of splendidly managing things; and that(P'ing Erh) had again to-day come across bitter sorrow, and that herdestiny was extremely unfortunate.
At this stage of his reverie, he began to feel wounded and distressed.When he rose once more to his feet, he noticed that the wine, which shehad spurted on the clothes, she had a few minutes back divested herselfof, had already half dried, and, taking up the iron, he smoothed themand folded them nicely for her. He then discovered that she had left herhandkerchief behind, and that it still bore traces of tears, so throwingit into the basin, he rinsed it and hung it up to dry, with feelingsbordering on joy as well as sadness. But after a short time spent in abrown study, he too betook himself to the Tao Hsiang village for a chat;and it was only when the lamps had been lit that he got up to take hisleave.
P'ing Erh put up in Li Wan's quarters for the night. Lady Feng sleptwith dowager lady Chia, while Chia Lien returned at a late hour to hishome. He found it however very lonely. Yet unable to go and call hiswife over, he had no alternative but to sleep as best he could for thatnight. On the morrow, he remembered, as soon as he opened his eyes, theoccurrence of the previous day, and he fell a prey to such extremeunhappiness that he could not be conscience-stricken enough.
Madame Hsing pondered with solicitude on Chia Lien's drunken fit the daybefore. The moment therefore it was light, she hastily crossed over, andsent for Chia Lien to repair to dowager lady Chia's apartments. ChiaLien was thus compelled to suppress all timidity and to repair to thefront part of the mansion and fall on his knees at the feet of his oldsenior.
"What was the matter?" inquired old lady Chia.
"I really had too much wine yesterday," Chia Lien promptly answered witha forced smile. "I must have given you a fright, worthy ancestor, so Icome to-day to receive condign punishment."
"You mean fellow!" shouted dowager lady Chia, spitting at himdisdainfully. "You go and glut yourself with spirits, and, not to speakof your not going to stretch yourself like a corpse and sleep it off,you contrariwise start beating your wife! But that vixen Feng brags awaythe whole day long, as if she were a human being as valiant as anytyrant, and yet yesterday she got into such a funk that she presented awoeful sight! Had it not been for me, you would have done her bodilyharm; and what would you feel like now?"
Chia Lien was at heart full of a sense of injury, but he could notmaster sufficient courage to say anything in his own defence. The onlycourse open to him was therefore to make a confession of fault.
"Don't lady Feng and P'ing Erh possess the charms of handsome women?"dowager lady Chia resumed. "And aren't you yet satisfied with them thatyou must, of a day, go slyly prowling and gallavanting about, draggingindiscriminately into your rooms frowsy and filthy people? Is it for thesake of this sort of wenches that you beat your wife and belabour theinmates of your quarters? You've nevertheless had the good fortune ofstarting in life as the scion of a great family; and do you, with eyeswide open, bring disgrace upon your own head? If you have any regard forme, well, then get up and I'll spare you! And if you make your apologiesin a proper manner to your wife and take her home, I'll be satisfied.But if you don't, just you clear out of this, for I won't even presumeto have any of your genuflexions!"
Chia Lien took to heart the injunctions that fell on his ear. Espyingbesides lady Feng standing opposite to him in undress, her eyes swollenfrom crying, and her face quite sallow, without cosmetic or powder, hethought her more lovable and charming than ever. "Wouldn't it be well,"he therefore mused, "that I should make amends, so that she and I may beon friendly terms again and that I should win the good pleasure of myold ancestor?"
At the conclusion of his reflections, he forthwith put on a smile."After your advice, venerable senior," he said, "I couldn't be so boldas not to accede to your wishes! But this is shewing her more indulgencethan ever!"
"What nonsense!" exclaimed dowager lady Chia laughingly. "I am wellaware that with her extreme decorum she couldn't hurt any one'ssusceptibilities. But should she, in the future, wrong you in any way, Ishall, of course, take the law into my own hands and bid you make hersubmit to your authority and finish."
Chia Lien, at this assurance, crawled up and made a bow to lady Feng."It was really my fault, so don't be angry, lady Secunda," he said.
Every one in the room laughed.
"Now, my girl Feng," lady Chia laughingly observed, "you are not to loseyour temper; for if you do, I'll lose mine too!"
Continuing, she directed a servant to go and call P'ing Erh; and, on herarrival, she advised lady Feng and Chia Lien to do all they could toreconcile her. At the sight of P'ing Erh, Chia Lien showed less regardthan ever for the saying that 'a primary wife differs from a secondarywife,' and the instant he heard old lady Chia's exhortation he drew nearher. "The injuries," he remarked, "to which you were subjectedyesterday, Miss, were entirely due to my shortcoming. If your lady hurtyour feelings, it was likewise all through me that the thing began. So Iexpress my regret; but, besides this, I tender my apologies as well onbehalf of your mistress."
Saying this, he made another bow. This evoked a smile from dowager ladyChia. Lady Feng, however, also laughed. Their old ancestor then desiredlady Feng to come and console P'ing Erh, but P'ing Erh hastily advancedand knocked her head before lady Feng. "I do deserve death," she urged,"for provoking your ladyship to wrath on the day of your birthday!"
Lady Feng was at the moment pricked by shame and remorse for having sofreely indulged in wine the previous day as to completely have lostsight of longstanding friendships, and for allowing her temper to sothoroughly flare up as to lend a patient ear to the gossip of outsiders,and unjustly put P'ing Erh out of countenance, so when she contrariwisenow saw her make advances, she felt both abashed and grieved, and,promptly extending her arms, she dragged her up and gave way to tears.
"I've waited upon your ladyship for all these years," P'ing Erh pleaded,"and you've never so much as given me a single fillip; and yet, you beatme yesterday. But I don't bear you any grudge, my lady, for it was thatwench, who was at the bottom of it all. Nor do I wonder that yourladyship lost control over your temper."
As she spoke, tears trickled down her cheeks too.
"Escort those three home!" dowager lady Chia shouted to the servants."If any one of them makes the least allusion to the subject, come atonce and tell me of it; for without any regard as to who it may be, Ishall take my staff and give him or her a sound flogging."
The trio then prostrated themselves before dowager lady Chia and the twoladies, Mesdames Hsing and Wang. And assenting to her old mistress'injunctions, an old nurse accompanied the three inmates to theirquarters.
When they got home, lady Feng assured herself that there was no oneabout. "How is it," she next asked, "that I'm like a queen of hell, orlike a 'Yakcha' demon? That courtesan swore at me and wished me dead;and did you too help her to curse me? If I'm not nice a thousand days,why, I must be nice on some one day! But if, poor me, I'm so bad as noteven to compare with a disorderly woman, how can I have the face to comeand spend my life with you here?"
So speaking, she melted into tears.
"Aren't you yet gratified?" cried Chia Lien. "Just reflect carefully whowas most to blame yesterday! And yet, in the presence of so many people,it was I who, after all, fell to-day on my knees and made apologies aswell. You came in for plenty of credit, and do you now go on jabber,jabber? Can it be that you'd like to make me kneel at your feet beforeyou let matters rest? If you try and play the bully beyond bounds, itwon't be a good thing for you!"
To these arguments, lady Feng could find no suitable response.
P'ing Erh then blurted out laughing.
"She's all right again!" Chia Lien smiled. "But I'm really quite at aloss what to do with this one."
These words were still on his lips, when they saw a married woman walkin. "Pao Erh's wife has committed suicide by hanging herself," she said.
This announcement plunged both Chia Lien and lady Feng into greatconsternation. Lady Feng, however, lost no time in putting away everysign of excitement. "Dead, eh? What a riddance!" she shouted instead."What's the use of making such a fuss about a mere trifle?"
But not long elapsed before she perceived Lin Chih-hsiao's wife make herappearance in the room. "Pao Erh's wife has hung herself," she whisperedto lady Feng in a low tone of voice, "and her mother's relatives want totake legal proceedings."
Lady Feng gave a sardonic smile. "That's all right!" she observed. "Imyself was just thinking about lodging a complaint!"
"I and the others tried to dissuade them," Lin Chih-hsiao's wifecontinued. "And by having recourse to intimidation as well as topromises of money, they, at last, agreed to our terms."
"I haven't got a cash," lady Feng replied. "Had I even any money, Iwouldn't let them have it; so just let them go and lodge any charge theyfancy. You needn't either dissuade them or intimidate them. Let them goand complain as much as they like. But if they fail to establish a caseagainst me, they'll, after all, be punished for trying to make thecorpse the means of extorting money out of me!"
Lin Chih-hsiao's wife was in a dilemma, when she espied Chia Lien winkat her. Comprehending his purpose, she readily quitted the apartment andwaited for him outside.
"I'll go out and see what they're up to!" Chia Lien remarked.
"Mind, I won't have you give them any money!" shouted lady Feng.
Chia Lien straightway made his exit. He came and held consultation withLin Chih-hsiao, and then directed the servants to go and use some fairmeans, others harsh. The matter was, however, not brought to anysatisfactory arrangement until he engaged to pay two hundred taels forburial expenses. But so apprehensive was Chia Lien lest something mightoccur to make the relatives change their ideas, that he also despatcheda messenger to lay the affair before Wang Tzu-t'eng, who bade a fewconstables, coroners and other official servants come and help him toeffect the necessary preparations for the funeral. The parties concerneddid not venture, when they saw the precautions he had adopted, to raiseany objections, disposed though they may have been to try and bringforward other arguments. Their sole alternative therefore was tosuppress their resentment, to refrain from further importunities and letthe matter drop into oblivion.
Chia Lien then impressed upon Lin Chih-hsiao to insert the two hundredtaels in the accounts for the current year, by making such additions tovarious items here and there as would suffice to clear them off, andpresented Pao Erh with money out of his own pocket as a crumb ofcomfort, adding, "By and bye, I'll choose a nice wife for you." When PaoErh, therefore, came in for a share of credit as well as of hard cash,he could not possibly do otherwise than practise contentment; andforthwith, needless to dilate on this topic, he began to pay court toChia Lien as much as ever.
In the inner rooms, lady Feng was, it is true, much cut up at heart; butshe strained every nerve to preserve an exterior of total indifference.Noticing that there was no one present in the apartment, she drew P'ingErh to her. "I drank yesterday," she smiled, "a little more wine thanwas good for me, so don't bear me a grudge. Where did I strike you, letme see?"
"You didn't really strike me hard!" P'ing Erh said by way of reply.
But at this stage they heard some one remark that the ladies and youngladies had come in.
If you desire, reader, to know any of the subsequent circumstances,peruse the account given in the following chapter.

CHAPTER XLV.
  Friends interchange words of friendship.  Tai-yue feels dull on a windy and rainy evening, and indites verses on      wind and rain.
Lady Feng, we will now go on to explain, was engaged in comforting P'ingErh, when upon unawares perceiving the young ladies enter the room, shehastened to make them sit down while P'ing Erh poured the tea.
"So many of you come to-day," lady Feng smiled, "that it looks as ifyou'd been asked to come by invitation."
T'an Ch'un was the first to speak. "We have," she smilingly rejoined,"two objects in view, the one concerns me; the other cousin Quarta; butamong these are, besides, certain things said by our venerable senior."
"What's up?" inquired lady Feng with a laugh. "Is it so urgent?"
"Some time ago," T'an Ch'un proceeded laughingly, "we started a rhymingclub; but the first meeting was not quite a success. Every one of usproved so soft-hearted! The rules therefore were set at naught. So Ican't help thinking that we must enlist your services as president ofthe society and superintendent; for what is needed to make the thingturn out well is firmness and no favour. The next matter is: cousinQuarta explained to our worthy ancestor that the requisites for paintingthe picture of the garden were short of one thing and another, and shesaid: 'that there must still be,' she fancied, 'in the lower story ofthe back loft some articles, remaining over from previous years, andthat we should go and look for them. That if there be any, they shouldbe taken out, but that in the event of their being none, some one shouldbe commissioned to go and purchase a supply of them.'"
"I'm not up to doing anything wet or dry, (play on word 'shih,'verses)," lady Feng laughed, "and would you have me, pray, come andgorge?"
"You may, it's possible, not be up to any of these things," T'an Ch'unreplied, "but we don't expect you to do anything! All we want you for isto see whether there be among us any remiss or lazy, and to decide howthey should be punished, that's all."
"You shouldn't try and play your tricks upon me!" lady Feng smiled, "Ican see through your little game! Is it that you wish me to act aspresident and superintendent? No! it's as clear as day that your objectis that I should play the part of that copper merchant, who put incontributions in hard cash. You have, at every meeting you hold, to eachtake turn and pay the piper; but, as your funds are not sufficient,you've invented this plan to come and inveigle me into your club, inorder to wheedle money out of me! This must be your little conspiracy!"
These words evoked general laughter. "You've guessed right!" theyexclaimed.
"In very truth," Li Wan smiled, "you're a creature with an intellect astransparent as crystal, and with wits as clear as glass!"
"You've got the good fortune of being their elder sister-in-law," ladyFeng smilingly remarked, "so the young ladies asked you to take them inhand, and teach them how to read, and make them learn good manners andneedlework; and it's for you to guide and direct them in everything! Buthere they start a rhyming society, for which not much can be needed, anddon't you concern yourself about them? We'll leave our worthy ancestorand our Madame Wang aside; they are old people, but you receive eachmoon an allowance of ten taels, which is twice as much as what any oneof us gets. More, our worthy ancestor and Madame Wang maintain thatbeing a widow, and having lost your home, you haven't, poor thing,enough to live upon, and that you have a young child as well to bringup; so they added with extreme liberality another ten taels to youroriginal share. Your allowance therefore is on a par with that of ourdear senior. But they likewise gave you a piece of land in the garden,and you also come in for the lion's share of rents, collected fromvarious quarters, and of the annual allowances, apportioned at the closeof each year. Yet, you and your son don't muster, masters and servants,ten persons in all. What you eat and what your wear comes, just as ever,out of the general public fund, so that, computing everything together,you get as much as four to five hundred taels. Were you then tocontribute each year a hundred or two hundred taels, to help them tohave some fun, how many years could this outlay continue? They'll verysoon be getting married, and, are they likely then to still expect youto make any contributions? So loth are you, however, at present to forkout any cash that you've egged them on to come and worry me! I'm quiteprepared to spend away until we've drained our chest dry! Don't I knowthat the money isn't mine?"
"Just you listen to her," Li Wan laughed. "I simply made one singleremark, and out she came with two cartloads of nonsensical trash! You'reas rough a diamond as a leg made of clay! All you're good for is to workthe small abacus, to divide a catty and to fraction an ounce, sofinicking are you! A nice thing you are, and yet, you've been luckyenough to come to life as the child of a family of learned and highofficials. You've also made such a splendid match; and do you stillbehave in the way you do? Had you been a son or daughter born in somepoverty-stricken, humble and low household, there's no saying what amean thing you wouldn't have been! Every one in this world has beengulled by you; and yesterday you went so far as to strike P'ing Erh! Butit wasn't the proper thing for you to stretch out your hand on her! Wasall that liquor, forsooth, poured down a cur's stomach? My monkey wasup, and I meant to have taken upon myself to avenge P'ing Erh'sgrievance; but, after mature consideration, I thought to myself, 'herbirthday is as slow to come round as a dog's tail grows to a point.' Ialso feared lest our venerable senior might be made to feel unhappy; soI did not come forward. Anyhow, my resentment isn't yet spent; and doyou come to-day to try and irritate me? You aren't fit to even pick upshoes for P'ing Erh! You two should therefore change your respectiveplaces!"
These taunts created merriment among the whole party.
"Oh!" hastily exclaimed lady Feng, laughingly, "I know everything! Youdon't at all come to look me up on account of verses or paintings, butsimply to take revenge on P'ing Erh's behalf! I never had any idea thatP'ing Erh had such a backer as yourself to bolster her up! Had I knownit, I wouldn't have ventured to strike her, even though a spirit hadbeen tugging my arm! Miss P'ing come over and let me tender my apologiesto you, in the presence of your senior lady and the young ladies. Dobear with me for having proved so utterly wanting in virtue, after I hadhad a few drinks!"
Every one felt amused by her insinuations.
"What do you say?" Li Wan asked P'ing Erh smiling. "As for me, I thinkit my bounden duty to vindicate your wrongs, before we let the matterdrop!"
"Your remarks, ladies, may be spoken in jest," P'ing Erh smiled, "but Iam not worthy of such a fuss!"
"What about worthy and unworthy?" Li Wan observed. "I'm here for you!Quick, get the key, and let your mistress go and open the doors and huntup the things!"
"Dear sister-in-law," lady Feng said with a smile, "you'd better goalong with them into the garden. I'm about to take the rice accounts inhand and square them up with them. Our senior lady, Madame Hsing, hasalso sent some one to call me; what she wants to tell me again, I can'tmake out; but I must need go over for a turn. There are, besides, allthose extra clothes for you people to wear at the end of the year, and Imust get them ready and give them to be made!"
"These matters are none of my business!" Li Wan laughingly answered."First settle my concerns so as to enable me to retire to rest, andescape the bother of having all these girls at me!"
"Dear sister-in-law," vehemently smiled lady Feng, "be good enough togive me a little time! You've ever been the one to love me best, and howis it that you have, on P'ing Erh's account, ceased to care for me? Timeand again have you impressed on my mind that I should, despite mymanifold duties, take good care of my health, and manage things in sucha way as to find a little leisure for rest, and do you now contrariwisecome to press the very life out of me? There's another thing besides.Should such clothes as will be required at the end of the year by anyother persons be delayed, it won't matter; but, should those of theyoung ladies be behind time, let the responsibility rest upon yourshoulders! And won't our old lady bear you a grudge, if you don't mindthese small things? But as for me, I won't utter a single word againstyou, for, as I had rather bear the blame myself, I won't venture, toinvolve you!"
"Listen to her!" Li Wan smiled. "Hasn't she got the gift of the gab? Butlet me ask you. Will you, after all, assume the control of this rhymingsociety or not?"
"What's this nonsense you're talking?" lady Feng laughed. "Were I not toenter the society, and spend a little money, won't I be treated as arebel in this garden of Broad Vista? And will I then still think oftarrying here to eat my head off? So soon as the day dawns to-morrow,I'll arrive at my post, dismount from my horse, and, after kneelingbefore the seals, my first act will be to give fifty taels for you toquietly cover the expenses of your meetings. Yet after a few days, Ishall neither indite any verses, nor write any compositions, as I amsimply a rustic boor, nothing more! But it will be just the same whetherI assume the direction or not; for after you pocket my money, there's nofear of your not driving me out of the place!"
As these words dropped from her lips, one and all laughed again.
"I'll now open the loft," proceeded lady Feng. "Should there be any ofthe articles you want, you can tell the servants to bring them out foryou to look at them! If any will serve your purpose, keep them and usethem. If any be short, I'll bid a servant go and purchase them accordingto your list. I'll go at once and cut the satin for the painting. As forthe plan, it isn't with Madame Wang; it's still over there, at Mr. ChiaChen's. I tell you all this so that you should avoid going over toMadame Wang's and getting into trouble! But I'll go and depute some oneto fetch it. I'll direct also a servant to take the satin and give it tothe gentlemen to size with alum; will this be all right?"
Li Wan nodded her head by way of assent and smiled. "This will beputting you to much trouble and inconvenience," she said. "But we mustreally act as you suggest. Well in that case, go home all of you, and,if after a time, she doesn't send the thing round, you can come againand bully her."
So saying, she there and then led off the young ladies, and was makingher way out, when lady Feng exclaimed: "It's Pao-yue and he alone, whohas given rise to all this fuss."
Li Wan overheard her remark and hastily turned herself round. "We did,in fact, come over," she smiled, "on account of Pao-yue, and we forgot,instead all about him! The first meeting was deferred through him; butwe are too soft-hearted, so tell us what penalty to inflict on him!"
Lady Feng gave herself to reflection. "There's only one thing to do,"she then remarked. "Just punish him by making him sweep the floor ofeach of your rooms. This will do!"
"Your verdict is faultless!" they laughed with one accord.
While they conversed they were on the point of starting on their wayback, when they caught sight of a young maid walk in, supporting nurseLai. Lady Feng and her companions immediately rose to their feet, theirfaces beaming with smiles. "Venerable mother!" they said, "do take aseat!" They then in a body presented their congratulations to her.
Nurse Lai seated herself on the edge of the stovecouch and returnedtheir smiles. "I'm to be congratulated," she rejoined, "but you,mistresses, are to be congratulated as well; for had it had not been forthe bountiful grace displaced by you, mistresses, whence would this joyof mine have come? Your ladyship sent Ts'ai Ko again yesterday to bringme presents, but my grandson _kotowed_ at the door, with his faceturned towards the upper quarters."
"When is he going to his post?" Li Wan inquired, with a smile.
Nurse Lai heaved a sigh. "How can I interfere with them?" she answered."Why, I let them have their own way and start when they like! The otherday, they were at my house, and they prostrated themselves before me;but I could find no complimentary remark to make to him, so, 'Sir!' Isaid, 'putting aside that you're an official, you've lived in a recklessand dissolute way, for now thirty years. You should, it's true, havebeen people's bond-servant, but from the moment you came out of yourmother's womb, your master graciously accorded you your liberty. Thanks,above, to the boundless blessings showered upon you by your lord, and,below, to the favour of your father and mother, you're like a noblescion and a gentleman, able to read and to write; and you have beencarried about by maids, old matrons, and nurses, just as if you had beena very phoenix! But now that you've grown up and reached this age, doyou have the faintest notion of what the two words 'bond-servant' imply?All you think of is to enjoy your benefits. But what hardships yourgrandfather and father had to bear, in slaving away for two or threegenerations, before they succeeded, after ever so many ups and downs, inraising up a thing like you, you don't at all know! From your veryinfancy, you ever ailed from this, or sickened for that, so that themoney that was expended on your behalf, would suffice to fuse into alifelike silver image of you! At the age of twenty, you again receivedthe bounty of your master in the shape of a promise to purchase officialstatus for you. But just mark, how many inmates of the principal branchand main offspring have to endure privation, and suffer the pangs ofhunger! So beware you, who are the offshoot of a bond-servant, lest yousnap your happiness! After enjoying so many good things for a decade, bythe help of what spirits, and the agency of what devils have you, Iwonder, managed to so successfully entreat your master as to induce himto bring you to the fore again and select you for office? Magistratesmay be minor officials, but their functions are none the less onerous.In whatever district they obtain a post, they become the father andmother of that particular locality. If you therefore don't mind yourbusiness, and look after your duties in such a way as to acquit yourselfof your loyal obligations, to prove your gratitude to the state and toshow obedience and reverence to your lord, heaven, I fear, will not evenbear with you!'"
Li Wan and lady Feng laughed. "You're too full of misgivings!" theyobserved. "From what we can see of him, he's all right! Some years back,he paid us a visit or two; but it's many years now that he hasn't puthis foot here. At the close of each year, and on birthdays, we've simplyseen his name brought in, that's all. The other day, that he came toknock his head before our venerable senior and Madame Wang, we caughtsight of him in her courtyard yonder; and, got up in the uniform of hisnew office, he looked so dignified, and stouter too than before. Nowthat he has got this post, you should be quite happy; instead of thatyou worry and fret about this and that! If he does get bad, why, he hashis father and mother yet to take care of him, so all you need do is tobe cheerful and content! When you've got time to spare, do get into achair and come in and have a game of cards and a chat with our worthysenior; and who ever will have the face to hurt your feelings? Why, wereyou go to your home, you'd also have there houses and halls, and who isthere who would not hold you in high respect? You're certainly, what onewould call, a venerable old dame!"
P'ing Erh poured a cup of tea and brought it to her. Nurse Lai speedilystood up. "You could have asked any girl to do this for me; it wouldn'thave mattered! But here I'm troubling you again!"
Apologising, she resumed, sipping her tea the while: "My lady you're notaware that young girls of this age must be in everything kept strictlyin hand. In the event of any license, they're sure to find time to kickup trouble, and annoy their elders. Those, who know (how well they aresupervised), will then say that children are always up to mischief. Butthose, who don't, will maintain that they take advantage of theirwealthy position to despise people; to the detriment as well of theirmistresses' reputation. How I regret that there's nothing that I can dowith him. Time after time, have I had to send for his father; and he hasbeen the better, after a scolding from him." Pointing at Pao-yue, "Idon't mind whether you feel angry with me for what I'm going to say,"she proceeded, "but if your father were to attempt now to exercise everso little control over you, your venerable grandmother is sure to tryand screen you. Yet, when in days gone by your worthy father was young,he used to be beaten by your grandfather. Who hasn't seen him do it? Butdid your father, in his youth resemble you, who have neither fear forGod or man? There was also our senior master, on the other side, Mr.Chia She. He was, I admit, wild; but never such a crossgrained fellow asyourself; and yet he too had his daily dose of the whip. There wasbesides the father of your elder cousin Chen, of the eastern mansion. Hehad a disposition that flared up like a fire over which oil is poured.If anything was said, and he flew into a rage, why, talk about a son, itwas really as if he tortured a robber. From all I can now see and hear,Mr. Chen keeps his son in check just as much as was the custom in olddays among his ancestors; the only thing is that he abides by it in somerespects, but not in others. Besides, he doesn't exercise the leastrestraint over his own self, so is it to be wondered at if all hiscousins and nieces don't respect him? If you've got any sense about you,you'll only be too glad that I speak to you in this wise; but if youhaven't, you mayn't be very well able to say anything openly to me, butyou'll inwardly abuse me, who knows to what extent!"
As she reproved him, they saw Lai Ta's wife arrive. In close successioncame Chou Jui's wife along with Chang Ts'ai's wife to report variousmatters.
"A wife," laughed lady Feng, "has come to fetch her mother-in-law!"
"I haven't come to fetch our old dame," Lai Ta's wife smilinglyrejoined, "but to inquire whether you, my lady and the young ladies,will confer upon us the honour of your company?"
When nurse Lai caught this remark, she smiled. "I've really grown quiteidiotic!" "What," she exclaimed, "was right and proper for me to say, Ididn't say, but I went on talking instead a lot of rot and rubbish! Asour relatives and friends are presenting their congratulations to ourgrandson for having been selected to fill up that office of his, we findourselves under the necessity of giving a banquet at home. But I wasthinking that it wouldn't do, if we kept a feast going the whole day,and we invited this one, and not that one. Reflecting also that it wasthanks to our master's vast bounty that we've come in for thisunforeseen glory and splendour, I felt quite agreeable to do anything,even though it may entail the collapse of our household. I thereforeadvised his father to give banquets on three consecutive days. That heshould, on the first, put up several tables, and a stage in our meangarden, and invite your venerable dowager lady, the senior ladies,junior ladies, and young ladies to come and have some distraction duringthe day, and that he should have several tables laid on the stage in themain pavilion outside, and request the senior and junior gentlemen toconfer upon us the lustre of their presence. That for the second day, weshould ask our relatives and friends; and that for the third, we shouldinvite our companions from the two mansions. In this way, we'll havethree days' excitement, and, by the boundless favour of our master,we'll have the benefit of enjoying the honour of your society."
"When is it to be?" Li Wan and lady Feng inquired, smilingly. "As far aswe are concerned, we'll feel it our duty to come. And we hope that ourworthy senior may feel in the humour to go. But there's no saying forcertain!"
"The day chosen is the fourteenth," Lai Ta's wife eagerly replied. "Justcome for the sake of our old mother-in-law!"
"I can't tell about the others," lady Feng explained with a laugh, "butas for me I shall positively come. I must however tell you beforehandthat I've no congratulatory presents to give you. Nor do I know anythingabout tips to players or others. As soon as I shall have done eating, Ishall bolt, so don't laugh at me."
"Fiddlesticks!" Lai Ta's wife laughed. "Were your ladyship disposed, youcould well afford to give us twenty and thirty thousand taels."
"I'm off now to invite our venerable mistress," nurse Lai smilinglyremarked. "And if her ladyship also agrees to come, I shall deem it agreater honour than ever conferred upon me."
Having said this, she went on to issue some injunctions; after which,she got up to go, when the sight of Chou Jui's wife reminded her ofsomething.
"Of course!" she consequently observed. "I've got one more question toask you, my lady. What did sister-in-law Chou's son do to incur blame,that he was packed off, and his services dispensed with?"
"I was just about to tell your daughter-in-law," lady Feng answeredsmilingly, after listening to her question, "but with so many things topreoccupy me, it slipped from my memory! When you get home,sister-in-law Lai, explain to that old husband of yours that we won'thave his, (Chou Jui's), son kept in either of the mansions; and that hecan tell him to go about his own business!"
Lai Ta's wife had no option but to express her acquiescence. Chou Jui'swife however speedily fell on her knees and gave way to urgententreaties.
"What is it all about?" nurse Lai shouted. "Tell me and let me determinethe right and wrong of the question."
"The other day," lady Feng observed, "that my birthday was celebrated,that young fellow of his got drunk, before the wine ever went round; andwhen the old dame, over there, sent presents, he didn't go outside togive a helping hand, but squatted down, instead, and upbraided people.Even the presents he wouldn't carry inside. And it was only after thetwo girls had come indoors that he eventually got the servant-lads andbrought them in. Those lads were however careful enough in what theydid, but as for him, he let the box, he held, slip from his hands, andbestrewed the whole courtyard with cakes. When every one had left, Ideputed Ts'ai Ming to go and talk to him; but he then turned round andgave Ts'ai Ming a regular scolding. So what's the use of not bundlingoff a disorderly rascal like him, who neither shows any regard fordiscipline or heaven?"
"I was wondering what it could be!" nurse Lai ventured. "Was it reallyabout this? My lady, listen to me! If he has done anything wrong, thrashhim and scold him, until you make him mend his ways, and finish with it!But to drive him out of the place, will never, by any manner of means,do. He isn't, besides, to be treated like a child born in our household.He is at present employed as Madame Wang's attendant, so if you carryout your purpose of expelling him, her ladyship's face will be put tothe blush. My idea is that you should, my lady, give him a lesson byletting him have several whacks with a cane so as to induce him toabstain from wine in the future. If you then retain him in your serviceas hitherto he'll be all right! If you don't do it for his mother'ssake; do it at least for that of Madame Wang!"
After lending an ear to her arguments, lady Feng addressed herself toLai Ta's wife. "Well, in that case," she said, "call him over to-morrowand give him forty blows; and don't let him after this touch any morewine!"
Lai Ta's wife promised to execute her directions. Chou Jui's wife thenkotowed and rose to her feet. But she also persisted upon prostratingherself before nurse Lai; and only desisted when Lai Ta's wife pulledher up. But presently the trio took their departure, and Li Wan and hercompanions sped back into the garden.
When evening came, lady Feng actually bade the servants go and look(into the loft), and when they discovered a lot of painting materials,which had been put away long ago, they brought them into the garden.Pao-ch'ai and her friends then selected such as they deemed suitable.But as they only had as yet half the necessaries they required, theydrew out a list of the other half and sent it to lady Feng, who,needless for us to particularise, had the different articles purchased,according to the specimens supplied.
By a certain day, the silk had been sized outside, a rough sketch drawn,and both returned into the garden. Pao-yue therefore was day after day tobe found over at Hsi Ch'un's, doing his best to help her in her hardwork. But T'an Ch'un, Li Wan, Ying Ch'un, Pao-ch'ai and the other girlslikewise congregated in her quarters, and sat with her when they were atleisure, as they could, in the first place, watch the progress of thepainting, and as secondly they were able to conveniently see somethingof each other.
When Pao-ch'ai perceived how cool and pleasant the weather was getting,and how the nights were beginning again to gradually draw out, she cameand found her mother, and consulted with her, until they got someneedlework ready. Of a day, she would cross over to the quarters ofdowager lady Chia and Madame Wang, and twice pay her salutations, but,she could not help as well amusing them and sitting with them to keepthem company. When free, she would come and see her cousins in thegarden, and have, at odd times, a chat with them, so having, duringdaylight no leisure to speak of, she was wont, of a night, to ply herneedle by lamplight, and only retire to sleep after the third watch hadcome and gone.
As for Tai-yue, she had, as a matter of course, a relapse of hercomplaint regularly every year, soon after the spring equinox and autumnsolstice. But she had, during the last autumn, also found hergrandmother Chia in such buoyant spirits, that she had walked a littletoo much on two distinct occasions, and naturally fatigued herself morethan was good for her. Recently, too, she had begun to cough and to feelheavier than she had done at ordinary times, so she never by any chanceput her foot out of doors, but remained at home and looked after herhealth. When at times, dullness crept over her, she longed for hercousins to come and chat with her and dispel her despondent feelings.But whenever Pao-ch'ai or any of her cousins paid her a visit, shebarely uttered half a dozen, words, before she felt quite averse to anysociety. Yet one and all made every allowance for her illness. And asshe had ever been in poor health and not strong enough to resist anyannoyance, they did not find the least fault with her, despite even anylack of propriety she showed in playing the hostess with them, or anyremissness on her part in observing the prescribed rules of etiquette.
Pao-ch'ai came, on this occasion to call on her. The conversationstarted on the symptoms of her ailment. "The various doctors, who visitthis place," Pao-ch'ai consequently remarked, "may, it's true, be allvery able practitioners; but you take their medicines and don't reap theleast benefit! Wouldn't it be as well therefore to ask some other personof note to come and see you? And could he succeed in getting you allright, wouldn't it be nice? Here you year by year ail away throughoutthe whole length of spring and summer; but you're neither so old nor soyoung, so what will be the end of it? Besides, it can't go on for ever."
"It's no use," Tai-yue rejoined. "I know well enough that there's no curefor this complaint of mine! Not to speak of when I'm unwell, why evenwhen I'm not, my state is such that one can see very well that there'sno hope!"
Pao-ch'ai shook her head. "Quite so!" she ventured. "An old writer says:'Those who eat, live.' But what you've all along eaten hasn't beenenough to strengthen your energies and physique. This isn't a goodthing!"
Tai-yue heaved a sigh. "Whether I'm to live or die is all destiny!" shesaid. "Riches and honours are in the hands of heaven; and human strengthcannot suffice to forcibly get even them! But my complaint this yearseems to be far worse than in past years, instead of any better."
While deploring her lot, she coughed two or three times. "It struck me,"Pao-ch'ai said, "that in that prescription of yours I saw yesterdaythere was far too much ginseng and cinnamon. They are splendid tonics,of course, but too many heating things are not good. I think that thefirst urgent thing to do is to ease the liver and give tone to thestomach. When once the fire in the liver is reduced, it will not be ableto overcome the stomach; and, when once the digestive organs are free ofailment, drink and food will be able to give nutriment to the humanframe. As soon as you get out of bed, every morning, take one ounce ofbirds' nests, of superior quality, and five mace of sugar candy andprepare congee with them in a silver kettle. When once you get into theway of taking this decoction, you'll find it far more efficacious thanmedicines; for it possesses the highest virtue for invigorating thevagina and bracing up the physique."
"You've certainly always treated people with extreme consideration,"sighed Tai-yue, "but such a supremely suspicious person am I that Iimagined that you inwardly concealed some evil design! Yet ever sincethe day on which you represented to me how unwholesome it was to readobscene books, and you gave me all that good advice, I've felt mostgrateful to you! I've hitherto, in fact, been mistaken in my opinion;and the truth of the matter is that I remained under this misconceptionup to the very present. But you must carefully consider that when mymother died, I hadn't even any sisters or brothers; and that up to thismy fifteenth year there has never been a single person to admonish me asyou did the other day. Little wonder is it if that girl Yuen speaks wellof you! Whenever, in former days, I heard her heap praise upon you, Ifelt uneasy in my mind, but, after my experiences of yesterday, I seehow right she was. When you, for instance, began to tell me all thosethings, I didn't forgive you at the time, but, without worrying yourselfin the least about it you went on, contrariwise, to tender me the adviceyou did. This makes it evident that I have laboured under a mistakenidea! Had I not made this discovery the other day, I wouldn't bespeaking like this to your very face to-day. You told me a few minutesback to take bird's nest congee; but birds' nests are, I admit, easilyprocured; yet all on account of my sickly constitution and of therelapses I have every year of this complaint of mine, which amounts tonothing, doctors have had to be sent for, medicines, with ginseng andcinnamon, have had to be concocted, and I've given already such troubleas to turn heaven and earth topsy-turvey; so were I now to start again anew fad, by having some birds' nests congee or other prepared, ourworthy senior, Madame Wang, and lady Feng, will, all three of them, haveno objection to raise; but that posse of matrons and maids below willunavoidably despise me for my excessive fussiness! Just notice how everyone in here ogles wildly like tigers their prey; and stealthily says onething and another, simply because they see how fond our worthy ancestoris of both Pao-yue and lady Feng, and how much more won't they do thesethings with me? What's more, I'm not a pucker mistress. I've really comehere as a mere refugee, for I had no one to sustain me and no one todepend upon. They already bear me considerable dislike; so much so, thatI'm still quite at a loss whether I should stay or go; and why should Imake them heap execrations upon me?"
"Well, in that case," Pao-ch'ai observed, "I'm too in the same plight asyourself!"
"How can you compare yourself with me?" Tai-yue exclaimed. "You have amother; and a brother as well! You've also got some business and land inhere, and, at home, you can call houses' and fields your own. It's onlytherefore the ties of relationship, which make you stay here at all.Neither are you in anything whether large or small, in their debt forone single cash or even half a one; and when you want to go, you're atliberty to go. But I, have nothing whatever that I can call my own. Yet,in what I eat, wear, and use, I am, in every trifle, entirely on thesame footing as the young ladies in their household, so how ever canthat mean lot not despise me out and out?"
"The only extra expense they'll have to go to by and bye," Pao-ch'ailaughed, "will be to get one more trousseau, that's all. And for thepresent, it's too soon yet to worry yourself about that!"
At this insinuation, Tai-yue unconsciously blushed scarlet. "One treatsyou," she smiled, "as a decent sort of person, and confides in you thewoes of one's heart, and, instead of sympathising with me, you make methe means of raising a laugh!"
"Albeit I raise a laugh at your expense," Pao-ch'ai rejoined, a smilecurling her lips, "what I say is none the less true! But compose yourmind! I'll try every day that I'm here to cheer you up; so come to mewith every grievance or trouble, for I shall, needless to say, dispelthose that are within my power. Notwithstanding that I have a brother,you yourself know well enough what he's like! All I have is a mother, soI'm just a trifle better off than you! We can therefore well look uponourselves as being in the same boat, and sympathise with each other. Youhave, besides, plenty of wits about you, so why need you give way togroans, as did Ssu Ma-niu? What you said just now is quite right; but,you should worry and fret about as little and not as much as you can. Onmy return home, to-morrow, I'll tell my mother; and, as I think theremust be still some birds' nests in our house, we'll send you severalounces of them. You can then tell the servant-maids to prepare some foryou at whatever time you want every day; and you'll thus be suiting yourown convenience and be giving no trouble or annoyance to any one."
"The things are, of themselves, of little account," eagerly respondedTai-yue laughingly. "What's difficult to find is one with as much feelingas yourself."
"What's there in this worth speaking about?" Pao-ch'ai said. "Whatgrieves me is that I fail to be as nice as I should be with those I comeacross. But, I presume, you feel quite done up now, so I'll be off!"
"Come in the evening again," Tai-yue pressed her, "and have a chat withme."
While assuring her that she would come, Pao-ch'ai walked out, so let usleave her alone for the present.
Tai-yue, meanwhile, drank a few sips of thin congee, and then once morelay herself down on her bed. But before the sun set, the weatherunexpectedly changed, and a fine drizzling rain set in. So gently comethe autumn showers that dull and fine are subject to uncertainalternations. The shades of twilight gradually fell on this occasion.The heavens too got so overcast as to look deep black. Besides theeffect of this change on her mind, the patter of the rain on the bambootops intensified her despondency, and, concluding that Pao-ch'ai wouldbe deterred from coming, she took up, in the lamp light, the first bookwithin her reach, which turned out to be the 'Treasury of MiscellaneousLyrics.' Finding among these 'the Pinings of a maiden in autumn,' 'theAnguish of Separation,' and other similar poems, Tai-yue felt unawaresmuch affected; and, unable to restrain herself from giving vent to herfeelings in writing, she, there and then, improvised the followingstanza, in the same strain as the one on separation; complying with therules observed in the 'Spring River-Flower' and 'Moonlight Night.' Theseverses, she then entitled 'the Poem on the Autumn evening, when wind andrain raged outside the window.' Their burden was:
  In autumn, flowers decay; herbage, when autumn comes, doth yellow      turn.  On long autumnal nights, the autumn lanterns with bright radiance      burn.  As from my window autumn scenes I scan, autumn endless doth seem.  This mood how can I bear, when wind and rain despondency enhance?  How sudden break forth wind and rain, and help to make the autumntide!  Fright snaps my autumn dreams, those dreams which under my lattice I      dreamt.  A sad autumnal gloom enclasps my heart, and drives all sleep away!  In person I approach the autumn screen to snuff the weeping wick.  The tearful candles with a flickering flame consume on their short      stands.  They stir up grief, dazzle my eyes, and a sense of parting arouse.  In what family's courts do not the blasts of autumn winds intrude?  And where in autumn does not rain patter against the window-frames?  The silken quilt cannot ward off the nipping force of autumn winds.  The drip of the half drained water-clock impels the autumn rains.  A lull for few nights reigned, but the wind has again risen in      strength.  By the lantern I weep, as if I sat with some one who must go.  The small courtyard, full of bleak mist, is now become quite desolate.  With quick drip drops the rain on the distant bamboos and vacant      sills.  What time, I wonder, will the wind and rain their howl and patter      cease?  The tears already I have shed have soaked through the window gauze.
After scanning her verses, she flung the pen aside, and was just on thepoint of retiring to rest, when a waiting-maid announced that 'masterSecundus, Mr. Pao-yue, had come.' Barely was the announcement out of herlips, than Pao-yue appeared on the scene with a large bamboo hat on hishead, and a wrapper thrown over his shoulders. Of a sudden, a smilebetrayed itself on Tai-yue's lips. "Where does this fisherman come from?"she exclaimed.
"Are you better to-day?" Pao-yue inquired with alacrity. "Have you hadany medicines? How much rice have you had to eat to-day?"
While plying her with questions, he took off the hat and divestedhimself of the wrapper; and, promptly raising the lamp with one hand, hescreened it with the other and threw its rays upon Tai-yue's face. Thenstraining his eyes, he scrutinised her for a while. "You look betterto-day," he smiled.
As soon as he threw off his wrapper, Tai-yue noticed that he was clad ina short red silk jacket, the worse for wear; that he was girded with agreen sash, and that, about his knees, his nether garments were visible,made of green thin silk, brocaded with flowers. Below these, he woreembroidered gauze socks, worked all over with twisted gold thread, and apair of shoes ornamented with butterflies and clusters of fallenflowers.
"Above, you fight shy of the rain," Tai-yue remarked, "but aren't theseshoes and socks below afraid of rain? Yet they're quite clean!"
"This suit is complete!" Pao-yue smiled. "I've got a pair of crab-woodclogs, I put on to come over; but I took them off under the eaves of theverandah."
Tai-yue's attention was then attracted by the extreme fineness andlightness of the texture of his wrapper and hat, which were unlike thosesold in the market places. "With what grass are they plaited?" sheconsequently asked. "It would be strange if you didn't, with this sortof things on, look like a very hedgehog!"
"These three articles are a gift from the Prince of Pei Ching," Pao-yueanswered. "Ordinarily, when it rains, he too wears this kind of outfitat home. But if it has taken your fancy, I'll have a suit made for you.There's nothing peculiar about the other things, but this hat is funny!The crown at the top is movable; so if you want to wear a hat, duringsnowy weather in wintertime, you pull off the bamboo pegs, and removethe crown, and there you only have the circular brim. This is worn, whenit snows, by men and women alike. I'll give you one therefore to wear inthe wintry snowy months."
"I don't want it!" laughed Tai-yue. "Were I to wear this sort of thing,I'd look like one of those fisherwomen, one sees depicted in pictures orrepresented on the stage!"
Upon reaching this point, she remembered that there was some connectionbetween her present remarks and the comparison she had some time backmade with regard to Pao-yue, and, before she had time to indulge inregrets, a sense of shame so intense overpowered her that the colourrushed to her face, and, leaning her head on the table, she coughed andcoughed till she could not stop. Pao-yue, however, did not detect herembarrassment; but catching sight of some verses lying on the table, heeagerly snatched them up and conned them from beginning to end."Splendid!" he could not help crying. But the moment Tai-yue heard hisexclamation, she speedily jumped to her feet, and clutched the versesand burnt them over the lamp.
"I've already committed them sufficiently to memory!" Pao-yue laughed.
"I want to have a little rest," Tai-yue said, "so please get away; comeback again to-morrow."
At these words, Pao-yue drew back his hand, and producing from his breasta gold watch about the size of a walnut, he looked at the time. The handpointed between eight and nine p.m.; so hastily putting it away, "Youshould certainly retire to rest!" he replied. "My visit has upset you.I've quite tired you out this long while." With these apologies, hethrew the wrapper over him, put on the rain-hat and quitted the room.But turning round, he retraced his steps inside. "Is there anything youfancy to eat?" he asked. "If there be, tell me, and I'll let ourvenerable ancestor know of it to-morrow as soon as it's day. Won't Iexplain things clearer than any of the old matrons could?"
"Let me," rejoined Tai-yue smiling, "think in the night. I'll let youknow early to-morrow. But harken, it's raining harder than it did; so beoff at once! Have you got any attendants, or no?"
"Yes!" interposed the two matrons. "There are servants to wait on him.They're outside holding his umbrella and lighting the lanterns."
"Are they lighting lanterns with this weather?" laughed Tai-yue.
"It won't hurt them!" Pao-yue answered. "They're made of sheep's horn, sothey don't mind the rain."
Hearing this, Tai-yue put back her hand, and, taking down an ornamentedglass lantern in the shape of a ball from the book case, she asked theservants to light a small candle and bring it to her; after which, shehanded the lantern to Pao-yue. "This," she said, "gives out more lightthan the others; and is just the thing for rainy weather."
"I've also got one like it." Pao-yue replied. "But fearing lest theymight slip, fall down and break it, I did not have it lighted andbrought round."
"What's of more account," Tai-yue inquired, "harm to a lantern or to ahuman being? You're not besides accustomed to wearing clogs, so tellthem to walk ahead with those lanterns. This one is as light and handyas it is light-giving; and is really adapted for rainy weather, sowouldn't it be well if you carried it yourself? You can send it over tome to-morrow! But, were it even to slip from your hand, it wouldn'tmatter much. How is it that you've also suddenly developed thismoney-grabbing sort of temperament? It's as bad as if you ripped yourintestines to secrete pearls in."
After these words, Pao-yue approached her and took the lantern from her.Ahead then advanced two matrons, with umbrellas and sheep horn lanterns,and behind followed a couple of waiting-maids also with umbrellas.Pao-yue handed the glass lantern to a young maid to carry, and,supporting himself on her shoulder, he straightway wended his steps onhis way back.
But presently arrived an old servant from the Heng Wu court, provided aswell with an umbrella and a lantern, to bring over a large bundle ofbirds' nests, and a packet of foreign sugar, pure as powder, and whiteas petals of plum-blossom and flakes of snow. "These," she said, "aremuch better than what you can buy. Our young lady sends you word, miss,to first go on with these. When you've done with them, she'll let youhave some more."
"Many thanks for the trouble you've taken!" Tai-yue returned for answer;and then asked her to go and sit outside and have a cup of tea.
"I won't have any tea," the old servant smiled. "I've got something elseto attend to."
"I'm well aware that you've all got plenty in hand," Tai-yue resumed witha smiling countenance. "But the weather being cool now and the nightslong, it's more expedient than ever to establish two things: a nightclub and a gambling place."
"I won't disguise the fact from you, miss," the old servant laughinglyobserved, "that I've managed this year to win plenty of money. Severalservants have, under any circumstances, to do night duty; and, as anyneglect in keeping watch wouldn't be the right thing, isn't it as wellto have a night club, as one can sit on the look-out and dispel dullnessas well? But it's again my turn to play the croupier to-day, so I mustbe getting along to the place, as the garden gate, will, by this time,be nearly closing!"
This rejoinder evoked a laugh from Tai-yue. "I've given you all thisbother," she remarked, "and made you lose your chances of getting money,just to bring these things in the rain." And calling a servant she badeher present her with several hundreds of cash to buy some wine with, todrive the damp away.
"I've uselessly put you again, miss, to the expense of giving me a tipfor wine," the old servant smiled. But saying this she knocked herforehead before her; and issuing outside, she received the money, afterwhich, she opened her umbrella, and trudged back.
Tzu Chuean meanwhile put the birds' nests away; and removing afterwardsthe lamps, she lowered the portieres and waited upon Tai-yue until shelay herself down to sleep.
While she reclined all alone on her pillow, Tai-yue thought gratefully ofPao-ch'ai. At one moment, she envied her for having a mother and abrother; and at another, she mused that with the friendliness Pao-yue hadever shown her they were bound to be the victims of suspicion. But thepitter-patter of the rain, dripping on the bamboo tops and bananaleaves, fell on her ear; and, as a fresh coolness penetrated thecurtain, tears once more unconsciously trickled down her cheeks. In thisframe of mind, she continued straight up to the fourth watch, when sheat last gradually dropped into a sound sleep.
For the time, however, there is nothing that we can add. So should you,reader, desire to know any subsequent details, peruse what is written inthe next chapter.

CHAPTER XLVI.
  An improper man with difficulty keeps from improprieties.  The maid, Yuean Yang, vows to break off the marriage match.
Lin Tai-yue, to resume our story, dropped off gradually to sleep aboutthe close of the fourth watch. As there is therefore nothing more thatwe can for the present say about her, let us take up the thread of ournarrative with lady Feng.
Upon hearing that Madame Hsing wanted to see her, she could not make outwhat it could be about, so hurriedly putting on some extra things on herperson and head, she got into a carriage and crossed over.
Madame Hsing at once dismissed every attendant from her suite ofapartments. "I sent for you," she began, addressing herself to ladyFeng, in a confidential tone, "not for anything else, but on account ofsomething which places me on the horns of a dilemma. My husband hasentrusted me with a job; and being quite at my wits' ends how to act,I'd like first to consult with you. My husband has taken quite a fancyto Yuean Yang, who is in our worthy senior's rooms; so much so, that he'sdesirous to get her into his quarters as a secondary wife. He hasdeputed me therefore to ask her of our venerable ancestor. I know thatthis is quite an ordinary matter. Yet I can't help fearing that ourworthy senior may refuse to give her. But do you perchance see your wayto bring this concern about?"
Lady Feng listened to her. "You shouldn't, I say, go and bang your headagainst a nail!" she then vehemently exclaimed. "Were our old ancestorseparated from Yuean Yang, she wouldn't even touch her rice! How evercould she reconcile herself to part from her? Besides, our worthy seniorhas time and again said, in the course of a chat, 'that she can't seethe earthly use of a man well up in years, as your lord and master is,having here one concubine, and there another? That cooping them up inhis rooms, is a mere waste of human beings. That he neglects hisconstitution and doesn't husband it; and that he doesn't either attenddiligently to his official duties, but spends his whole days in boozingwith his young concubines. When your ladyship hears these nice doings ofhis, don't you feel enamoured with that fine gentleman of ours? Were heeven to try, at this juncture, to beat a retreat, he couldn't, I fear,effectively do so. Yet, instead of (making an effort to turn tail), hewants to go and dig the tiger's nostrils with a blade of straw. Don't,my lady, be angry with me; but I daren't undertake the errand. It'sclear as day that it will be a wild goose chase. What's more, it will dohim no good; but will, contrariwise, heap disgrace upon his own head!Our Mr. Chia She is now so stricken in years, that in all his actions heunavoidably behaves somewhat as a dotard. It would be well therefore foryour ladyship to advise him what to do. It isn't as if he were in theprime of life to be able to do all these things with impunity! He's gotat present a whole array of brothers, nieces, sons, and grandsons; andshould he still go on in this wild sort of way, how will he be able toface any of them?"
Madame Hsing gave a sardonic smile. "There are endless wealthy familieswith three and four concubines," she said, "and is it in ours that sucha thing won't do? But were I even to tender him as much advice as I can,it isn't at all likely that he'll abide by it! Even though that maid beone beloved by our venerable senior, it doesn't follow that she'll verywell be able to give a rebuff to a hoary-bearded elderly son, and,erewhile, an official, were he to express a wish to have her as aninmate of his household! I sent for you for no other purpose than todeliberate with you, and here you take the initiative and enumerate awhole array of shortcomings. But is there any reason why I shouldcommission you to go? Of course I'll go and speak to her! You make abold statement that I don't give him any good counsel; but don't you yetknow that with a disposition, such as his, he rushes, before I can verywell open my lips to advise him, into a tantrum with me?"
Lady Feng was well alive to the fact that Madame Hsing was, by nature,simple and weak-minded, and that all she knew was to adulate Chia She soas to ensure her own safety. That she was, in the next place, everready, so greedy was she, to grasp as much hard cash and as manyeffects, as she could lay hold of, for her own private gain. That sheleft all family matters, irrespective of important or unimportant, underthe sole control of Chia She; but that, whenever anything turned up,involving any receipts or payments, she extorted an unusual percentage,the moment the money passed through her clutches, giving out as apretence: 'Well Chia She is so extravagant that I have to interfere andeffect sufficient economies to enable us to make up our deficits.' Andthat she would not trust any one, whether son, daughter or servant, norlend an ear to a single word of remonstrance. When she therefore nowheard Madame Hsing speak as she did, she concluded that she must be inanother of her perverse moods, and that any admonitions would be of noavail. So hastily forcing a smile: "My lady," she observed, "you'reperfectly right in your remarks! But how long can I have lived, and whatdiscrimination can I boast of? It seems to me that if a father andmother do not bestow, not a mere servant-girl like she is, but a livingjewel of the size of her, on one like Mr. Chia She, to whom are theylikely to give her? How can one give faith to words spoken behind one'sback? So what a fool I was (in cramming what I heard down my throat)!Just take our Mr. Secundus, (my husband), as an instance. If ever hedoes anything to incur blame, Mr. Chia She and you, my lady, feel sowrath with him as to only wish you could lay hands upon him there andthen and give him such a blow as would kill him downright, but themoment you set eyes on his face, your whole resentment vanishes, and lo,you again let him have, as of old, everything, and anything, much thoughboth of you might relish it in your hearts! Our worthy ancestor willcertainly therefore behave in the present instance, with equalliberality, towards Mr. Chia She! So if her ladyship feels in the humourto-day, she'll let him have her, I fancy, at once this very day, if hemakes the proper advances. But I'll go ahead and coax our venerablesenior; and, when your ladyship comes over, I'll find some pretence toget out of the way, and take along with me those too who may be presentin her rooms, so as to make it convenient for you to broach the subject.If she gives her, so much the better. But if even she doesn't, it won'tmatter; for none of the inmates will have any idea what the object ofyour mission could have been."
After listening to her suggestion, Madame Hsing began again to feel in ahappier frame of mind. "My idea is," she observed, "that I shouldn'tstart by mentioning anything to our venerable senior, for were she tosay that she wouldn't give her, the matter would be simply quashed onthe head. I can't help thinking that I should first and foremost quietlyapproach Yuean Yang on the subject. She will, of course, feel extremelyashamed, but when I explain everything minutely to her, she'll certainlyhave nothing to say against the proposal, and everything will be allright. I can then speak to our old senior; and, despite any desire onher part not to accede to our wishes, she won't be able to put the girloff, provided she herself be willing; for as the adage says: 'If aperson wishes to go, it's no use trying to keep him.' Thus needless tosay, the whole thing will be satisfactorily settled!"
"You're really shrewd in your devices, my lady!" lady Feng smilinglyejaculated. "This is perfect in every respect! For without taking YueanYang into account, what girl does not long to rise high, or hope toexalt herself, or think of pushing herself forward above the rest as tocast away the chances of becoming half a mistress, and prefer insteadbeing a maid, and merely becoming by and bye the mate of someservant-lad?"
"Quite so!" Madame Hsing smiled. "But let's put Yuean Yang aside. Who isthere, even among the various elderly waiting-maids, who look after thehouse, who wouldn't be only too willing to step into these shoes? You'dbetter then go ahead. But, mind, don't let the cat out of the bag! I'lljoin you as soon as I can finish my evening meal."
"Yuean Yang," thereupon secretly reflected lady Feng, "has always been anextremely shrewd-minded girl; to such a degree, that there isnotwithstanding all our arguments, no saying positively whether she'llaccept or refuse. So were I to go ahead, and Madame Hsing to follow meby and bye, there won't be any occasion for her to grumble or complain,so long as she assents; but, if she doesn't, why, Madame Hsing, who isso suspicious a creature, will possibly imagine that I've been gassingwith her, and been the means of making her put on side and assume highairs. When Madame Hsing finds then that my conjectures have turned outtrue again, her shame will be converted into anger, and she'll so venther spite upon me that I shall, after all, be put in a false position.Would it not be better then that she and I should go together; for, ifshe says 'yes,' I'll be all right; and, if she replies 'no,' I'll be onthe safe side; and no suspicion, of any kind, will fall upon me!"
At the close of her reflections, "As I was about to cross over here,"she remarked laughingly, "our aunt yonder sent us two baskets of quails,and I gave orders that they should be fried, with the idea that theyshould be brought to your ladyship, in time for you to have some at yourevening repast. Just as I was stepping inside the main entrance, I sawthe servant-boys carrying your curricle; they said that it was yourladyship's vehicle, that it had cracked, and that they were taking it tobe repaired. Wouldn't it be as well then that you should now come in mycarriage, for it will be better for you and me to get there together?"
At this suggestion, Madame Hsing directed her servants to come andchange her costume. Lady Feng quickly waited upon her, and in a whilethe two ladies got into one and the same curricle and drove over.
"My lady," lady Feng went on to say, "it would be well for you to lookup our worthy senior, for were I to accompany you, and her ladyship toask me what was the object of my visit, it would be rather awkward. Thebest way is for your ladyship to go first, and I'll join you, as soon asI divest myself of my fine clothes."
Madame Hsing noticed how reasonable her proposal was, and she readilybetook herself to old lady Chia's quarters. But after a chat with hersenior, she quitted the apartment, under the pretence that she was goingto Madame Wang's rooms. Then making her exit by the back door, shepassed in front of Yuean Yang's bedroom. Here she saw Yuean Yang sitting,hard at work at some needlework. The moment she caught sight of MadameHsing, she rose to her feet.
"What are you up to?" Madame Hsing laughingly inquired. "Let me see! Howmuch nicer you embroider artificial flowers now!"
So speaking, she entered, and, taking the needlework from her hands, shescrutinised it, while extolling its beauty. Then laying down the work,and scanning her again from head to foot, she observed that her costumeconsisted of a half-new, grey thin silk jacket, and a bluish satinwaistcoat with scollops; that below this came a water-green jupe; thather waist was slim as that of a wasp; that her shoulders sloped as ifpared; that her face resembled a duck's egg; that her hair was black andshiny; that her nose was very high, and that on both her cheeks wereslightly visible several small flat moles.
Yuean Yang realised how intently she was being passed under scrutiny, andbegan to feel inwardly uneasy; while utter astonishment prevailed in hermind. "Madame," she felt impelled to ask, "what do you come for at thisimpossible hour?"
At a wink from Madame Hsing, her attendants withdrew from the room.Madame Hsing forthwith seated herself, and grasped Yuean Yang's hand inhers. "I've come," she smiled, "with the special purpose of presentingyou my congratulations."
This reply enabled Yuean Yang at once to form within herself some surmisemore or less correct of the object of her errand, and suddenly blushingcrimson, she lowered her head, and uttered not a word.
"You know well enough," she next heard Madame Hsing resume, "thatthere's not a single reliable person with my husband; but much thoughwe'd like to purchase some other girl we fear that such as might comeout of a broker's household wouldn't be quite spotless and taintless.Nor would one be able to get any idea what her failings are, until aftershe has been purchased and brought home; when she too will be sure, intwo or three days, to behave like an imp and play some monkey tricks!That's why we thought of choosing some home-born girl out of those whichthrong in our mansion, but then again we could find none decent enough;for if her looks were not at fault, her disposition was not proper; andif she possessed this quality, she lacked that one. Hence it is thatafter repeatedly choosing with dispassionate eye, during half a year,(he finds) that there's only you among that whole bevy of girls, who'sworth anything; that in looks, behaviour and deportment, you're gentle,trustworthy, and perfection itself in every respect. His intentiontherefore is to ask your hand of our old lady and take you over andattach you to his quarters. You won't be treated as one newly-purchased,or newly-sought for outside; for the moment you put your foot into ourhouse, you'll at once have your face shaved and be promoted to asecondary wife; so you'll thus attain as much dignity as honour. More,you're one who is anxious to excel; and, as the proverb says, 'gold willstill be exchanged for gold.' My husband has, who'd have thought it,taken a fancy to you, so when you now enter our threshold, you'll fulfilthe wish you've cherished all along with such high purpose and loftyaim, and stop the mouths of those persons, who are envious of your lot.Follow me therefore and let's go and lay the matter before our venerableancestor."
Arguing the while, she dragged her by the hand with the idea of hurryingher off there and then. Yuean Yang, however, blushed to her very ears,and, snatching her hand out of her grip she refused to budge.
Madame Hsing was conscious that she was under the spell of intenseshame. "What's there in this to be ashamed?" she continued, "You needn'tbesides breathe a word! All you have to do is to follow me, that's all."
Yuean Yang continued to droop her head and to decline to go with her.Madame Hsing, perceiving her behaviour, went on to exhort her. "Is itlikely, pray," she said, "that you still hesitate? If you actually don'tfeel inclined to accept the offer, you're, in real truth, a foolishgirl; for here you let go the chances of becoming the secondary consortof a master, and choose instead to continue a servant-girl. You'll beunited, in two or three years, to no one higher than some youngdomestic, and remain as much a bond-servant as ever! If you come alongwith us, you know that my disposition too is gentle; that I'm not one ofthose persons, who don't show any regard for any one; that my husbandwill also treat you as well as he does every one else, and that when, inthe course of a year or so, you give birth to a son or daughter, you'llbe placed on the same footing as myself. And of all the servants athome, will any you may wish to employ not deign to move to execute yourorders? If now that you have a chance of becoming a mistress, you don'tchoose to, why, you'll miss the opportunity, and then you may repent it,but it will be too late!"
Yuean Yang still kept her head bent against her chest and spake not asyllable by way of reply.
"How is it," added Madame Hsing, "that you, who've ever been so quickhave now too begun to be so infirm of purpose? What is there thatdoesn't fall in with your wishes? Just tell me; and I can safely assureyou that you'll have everything done to satisfy you."
Yuean Yang observed, as hitherto, perfect silence.
"I suppose," laughed Madame Hsing, "that having a father and mother, youyourself don't wish to speak, for fear of being put to the blush, andthat you want to wait until such time as they consult you about it, eh?This is quite right! But you'd better let me go and make the proposal tothem and tell them to come and ascertain your wishes; and whatever youranswer then may be just entrust it to them."
This said, she sped into lady Feng's suite of rooms.
Lady Feng had long ago changed her attire, and availed herself of theabsence of any bystander in her apartments to confide the whole matterto P'ing Erh.
P'ing Erh nodded her head and smiled. "According to my views, success isnot so certain," she observed. "She and I have often secretly talkedthis matter over, and the arguments I heard her propound don't make itthe least probable that she'll consent. But all we can say now is:'We'll see!'"
"Madame Hsing," lady Feng remarked, "is sure to come over here toconsult with me. If she has assented, well and good; but, if she hasn't,she'll bring displeasure upon her own self, and won't she feel out ofcountenance, if all of you are present? So tell the others to fryseveral quails, and get anything nice, that goes well with them, andprepare it for our repast, while you can go and stroll about in someother spot, and return when you fancy she has gone."
Hearing this, P'ing Erh transmitted her wishes word for word to thematrons; after which, she sauntered leisurely all alone, into thegarden.
When Yuean Yang saw Madame Hsing depart, she concluded that she was boundto go into lady Feng's rooms to consult with her, and that some one wassure to come and ask her about the proposal, so thinking it advisable tocross over to this side of the mansion to get out of the way, sheconsequently repaired in quest of Hu Po.
"Should our old mistress," she said to her, "ask for me, just say that Iwas so unwell that I couldn't even have any breakfast; that I've goneinto the garden for a stroll, but that I will be back at once."
Hu Po undertook to tell her so, and Yuean Yang then betook herself toointo the garden. While lolling all over the place, she, contrary to herexpectations, encountered P'ing Erh. P'ing Erh looked round to see thatthere was no one about. "Here comes the new secondary wife!" shesmilingly exclaimed.
Yuean Yang caught this greeting, and promptly the colour rose to herface. "How strange it is," she rejoined, "that you've all colludedtogether to come, with one accord, and scheme against me! But wait untilI've had it out with your mistress, and then I'll set things all right."
When P'ing Erh observed the angry look on Yuean Yang's countenance, herconscience was so stricken with remorse, on account of the inconsiderateremark she had passed, that drawing her under the maple tree, she madeher sit on the same boulder as herself, and then went so far as torecount to her, from beginning to end, all that transpired, andeverything that was said on lady Feng's return, a short while back, fromthe off mansion.
Blushes flew to Yuean Yang's cheeks. Facing P'ing Erh, she gave asardonic smile. "We've all ever been friends," she said, "that is: HsiJen, Hu Po, Su Yuen, Tzu Chuean, Ts'ai Hsia, Yue Ch'uan, She Yueeh, Ts'uiMo, Ts'ui Lue, who was in Miss Shih's service and is now gone, K'o Jenand Chin Ch'uan, now deceased, Hsi Hsueeh, who left, and you and I. Eversince our youth up, how many chats have the ten or dozen of us not had,and what have we not been up to together? But now that we've grown up,each of us has gone her own way! Yet, my heart is just what it was indays gone by. Whenever there's anything for me to say or do, I don't tryto impose upon any of you; so just first treasure in your heart thesecret I'm going to tell you, and don't mention it to our lady Secunda!Not to speak of our senior master wishing to make me his concubine, wereeven our lady to die this very moment, and he to send endlessgo-betweens, and countless betrothal presents, with the idea of weddingme and taking me over as his lawful primary wife, I wouldn't also go."
P'ing Erh was at this point desirous to put in some observation, whenfrom behind the boulder became audible the loud tones of laughter. "Youmost barefaced girl!" a voice cried. "It's well you're not afraid ofyour teeth falling when you utter such things!"
These words reached the ears of both girls, and, so unawares were theytaken, that they got a regular start, and jumping up with all haste theywent to see behind the boulder. They found no one else than Hsi Jen, whopresented herself before them, with a smiling countenance, and asked:"What's up? Do tell me!"
As she spoke, the trio seated themselves on a rock. P'ing Erh thenimparted to Hsi Jen as well the drift of their recent conversation.
"Properly speaking, we shouldn't pass such judgments," Hsi Jen remarked,after listening to her confidences, "but this senior master of ours isreally a most licentious libertine. So much so, that whenever he comesacross a girl with any good looks about her, he won't let her out of hisgrasp."
"Since you don't like to entertain his offer," P'ing Erh suggested,"I'll put you up to a plan."
"What plan is it?" Yuean Yang inquired.
"Just simply tell our old mistress," P'ing Erh laughed, "this answer:that you've already been promised to our master Secundus, Mr. Lien. Oursenior master then won't very well be able to be importunate.'"
"Ts'ui!" ejaculated Yuean Yang. "What a thing you are! Do you still makesuch suggestions? Didn't your mistress the other day utter this sillynonsense! Who'd have thought it, her words have now come true!"
"If you won't have either of them," Hsi Jen smiled, "my idea is that youshould tell our old lady point blank and ask her to give out that shepromised you long ago to our master, number two, Pao-yue. Our seniormaster will then banish this fad from his mind."
Yuean Yang was overcome with anger, shame and exasperation. "Whatdreadful vixens both of you are!" she shouted. "You don't deserve anatural death! I find myself in a fix, and treat you as decent sort ofpersons and confide in you so that you should arrange matters for me;and not to say that you don't bother yourselves a rap about me, you taketurn and turn about to poke fun at me! You're under the impression, inyour own minds, that your fates are sealed, and that both of you arebound by and bye to become secondary wives; but I can't help thinkingthat affairs under the heavens don't so certainly fall in always withone's wishes and expectations! So you'd better now pull up a bit, andnot be cheeky to such an excessive degree!"
Both her companions then realised in what state of despair she was, andpromptly forcing a smile, "Dear sister," they said, "don't be so touchy!We've been, ever since we were little mites, like very sisters! Allwe've done is to spontaneously indulge in a little fun in a spot wherethere's no one present. But tell us what you've decided to do, so thatwe too should know, and set our minds at ease."
"Decided what?" Yuean Yang cried. "All I know is that I won't go; that'sfinished."
P'ing Erh shook her head. "You mightn't go," she interposed, "but itisn't likely that the matter will drop. You're well aware what sort oftemperament that of our senior master's is. It's true that you'reattached to our old mistress' rooms, and that he can't, just at present,presume to do the least thing to you; but can it be, forsooth, thatyou'll be with the old dame for your whole lifetime? You'll also have toleave to get married, and if you then fall into his hands, it won't gowell with you."
Yuean Yang smiled ironically. "I won't leave this place so long as my oldlady lives!" Yuean Yang protested. "In the event of her ladyshipdeparting this life, he'll have, under any circumstances, to also gointo mourning for three years; for there's no such thing as starting bymarrying a concubine, soon after a mother's death! And while he waitsfor three years to expire, can one say what may not happen? It will betime enough to talk about it when that date comes. But should I bedriven to despair from being hard pressed, I'll cut my hair off andbecome a nun. If not, there's yet another thing: death! And as for awhole life time I shall not join myself to a man, what joy will not thenbe mine, for having managed to preserve my purity?"
"In very truth," P'ing Erh and Hsi Jen laughed, "this vixen has no senseof shame! She has now more than ever spoken whatever came foremost toher lips!"
"What matters a moment's shame," Yuean Yang rejoined, "when things havereached this juncture? But if you don't believe my words, well, you'llbe able to see by and bye; then you'll feel convinced. Madame Hsing saida short while back that she was going to look up my father and mother,but I'd like to see whether she'll proceed to Nanking to find them."
"Your parents are in Nanking looking after the houses," P'ing Erh said,"and they can't come up; yet, in the long run, they can be found out.Your elder brother and your sister-in-law are besides in here atpresent. You, poor thing, are a child born in this establishment. You'renot like us two, who are solitary creatures here."
"What does it matter whether I be born here or not?" Yuean Yangexclaimed. "'You can lead a horse to a fountain, but you can't make himdrink!' So if I don't listen to any proposals, is it likely, may I ask,that they'll kill my father and mother?" While the words were still onher lips, they caught sight of her sister-in-law, advancing from theopposite side. "As they couldn't at once get at your parents," Hsi Jenremarked, "they've, for a certainty, told your sister-in-law."
"All this wench is good for," Yuean Yang shouted, "is 'to rush about asif selling camels in the six states!' If she heard what I said, shewon't feel flattered."
But while she spoke, her sister-in-law approached them. "Where didn't Ilook for you?" her sister-in-law smilingly observed. "Have you, miss,run over here? Come along with me; I've got something to tell you!"
P'ing Erh and Hsi Jen speedily motioned to her to sit down, but (YueanYang's) sister-in-law demurred. "Young ladies, pray be seated; I've comein search of our girl to tell her something."
Hsi Jen and P'ing Erh feigned perfect ignorance. "What can it be thatit's so pressing?" they said with a smile. "We were engaged in guessingpuns here, so let's find out this, before you go."
"What do you want to tell me?" Yuan Yang inquired. "Speak out!"
"Follow me!" her sister-in-law laughed. "When we get over there, I'lltell you. It's really some good tidings!"
"Is it perchance what Madame Hsing has told you?" Yuean Yang asked.
"Since you, miss, know what it's all about," her sister-in-law addedsmilingly, "what else remains for me to do? Be quick and come with meand I'll explain everything. Verily, it's a piece of happiness as largeas the heavens!"
Yuean Yang, at these words, rose to her feet and spat contemptuously withall her might in her sister-in-law's face. Pointing at her: "Be quick,"she cried abusively, "and stop that filthy tongue of yours! It would beever so much better, were you to bundle yourself away from this! Whatgood tidings and what piece of happiness! Little wonder is it that youlong and crave the whole day long to see other people's daughter turnedinto a secondary wife as one and all of your family would rely upon herto act contrary to reason and right! A whole household has beenconverted into secondary wives! But the sight fills you with such keenjealousy that you would like to also lay hold of me and throw me intothe pit-fire! If any honours fall to my share, all of you outside willdo everything disorderly and improper, and raise yourselves, in your ownestimations, to the status of uncles (and aunts). But if I don't getany, and come to grief, you'll draw in your foul necks, and let me liveor die as I please!"
While indulging in this raillery, she gave vent to tears. P'ing Erh andHsi Jen did all they could to reason with her so as to prevent her fromcrying.
Her sister-in-law felt quite out of countenance. "Whether you mean toaccept the proposal, or not," she consequently said, "you can anyhowspeak nicely. It isn't worth the while dragging this one in andinvolving that one! The proverb adequately says: 'In the presence of adwarf one mustn't speak of dwarfish things!' Here you've been heapinginsult upon me, but I didn't presume to retaliate. These two youngladies have however given you no provocation whatever; and yet byreferring, as you've done, in this way and that way to secondary wiveshow can people stand it peacefully?"
"You shouldn't speak so!" Hsi Jen and P'ing Erh quickly remonstrated."She didn't allude to us; so don't be implicating others! Have you heardof any ladies or gentlemen who'd like to raise us to the rank ofsecondary wives? What's more, we two have neither father nor mother, norbrothers, within these doors, to avail themselves of our positions toact in a way contrary to right and reason! If she abuses people, let herdo so; it isn't worth our while to be touchy!"
"Seeing," Yuean Yang resumed, "that the abuse I've heaped upon her headhas put her to such shame that she doesn't know where to go and screenher face, she tries to egg you two on! But you two have, fortunately,your wits about you! Though quite impatient, I never started arguing thequestion; she it was who chose to speak just now."
Her sister-in-law felt inwardly much disconcerted, and beat a retreat inhigh dudgeon. But Yuean Yang so lost her temper that she still went on toabuse her; and it was only after P'ing Erh and Hsi Jen had admonishedher for ever so long that she let the matter drop.
"What were you hiding there for?" P'ing Erh then asked Hsi Jen. "Wecouldn't see anything of you."
"I went," Hsi Jen explained, "into Miss Quarta's rooms to see our Mr.Pao-yue, but, who'd have thought it, I got there a little too late, andthey told me that he had gone home. But my suspicions were, however,aroused as I couldn't make out how it was that I hadn't come across him,and I was about to go and hunt him up in Miss Lin's apartments, when Imet one of her servants who said that he hadn't been there either. Thenjust as I was surmising that he must have gone out of the garden,behold, you came, as luck would have it, from the opposite direction.But I dodged you, so you didn't see anything of me. Subsequently, shetoo appeared on the scene; but I got behind the boulder, from the backof these trees. I, however, saw that you two had come to have a chat.Strange to say, though you have four eyes between you, you never caughta glimpse of me."
Scarcely had she concluded this remark, than they heard some one elsefrom behind, laughingly exclaim, "Four eyes never saw you, but your sixeyes haven't as yet found me out!"
The three girls received quite a shock from fright; but turning round,they perceived that it was no other person than Pao-yue.
Hsi Jen smiled, and was the first to speak. "You've made me have a goodsearch," she said. "Where do you hail from?"
"I was just leaving cousin Quarta's," Pao-yue laughed, "when I noticedyou coming along, just in front of me; and knowing well enough that youwere bent upon finding me, I concealed myself to have a lark with you. Isaw you then go by, with uplifted head, enter the court, walk out again,and ask every one you met on your way; but there I stood convulsed withlaughter. I was only waiting to rush up to you and frighten you, when Iafterwards realised that you too were prowling stealthily about, so Ireadily inferred that you also were playing a trick upon some one. Thenwhen I put out my head and looked before me, I saw that it was these twogirls, so I came behind you, by a circuitous way; and as soon as youleft, I forthwith sneaked into your hiding place."
"Let's go and look behind there," P'ing Erh suggested laughingly; "wemay possibly discover another couple; there's no saying."
"There's no one else!" Pao-yue laughed.
Yuean Yang had long ago concluded that every word of their conversationhad been overheard by Pao-yue; but leaning against the rock, shepretended to be fast asleep.
Pao-yue gave her a push. "This stone is cold!" he smiled. "Let's go andsleep in our rooms. Won't it be better there?"
Saying this, he made an attempt to pull Yuean Yang to her feet. Thenhastily pressing P'ing Erh to repair to his quarters and have some tea,he united his efforts with those of Hsi Jen, and tried to induce YueanYang to come away. Yuean Yang, at length, got up, and the quartet betookthemselves, after all, into the I Hung court.
Pao-yue had caught every word that had fallen from their lips a fewminutes back, and felt, indeed, at heart so much distressed on YueanYang's behalf, that throwing himself silently on his bed, he left thethree girls in the outer rooms to prosecute their chat and laugh.
On the other side of the compound, Madame Hsing about this time inquiredof lady Feng who Yuean Yang's father was.
"Her father," lady Feng replied, "is called Chin Ts'ai. He and his wifeare in Nanking; they have to look after our houses there, so they can'tpay frequent visits to the capital. Her brother is the Wen-hsiang, whoacts at present as our senior's accountant; but her sister-in-law too isemployed in our worthy ancestor's yonder as head washerwoman."
Madame Hsing thereupon despatched a servant to go and call Yuean Yang'ssister-in-law. On Mrs. Chin Wen-hsiang's arrival, she told her all. Mrs.Chin was naturally pleased and left in capital spirits to find YueanYang, in the hope that the moment she communicated the offer to her, thewhole thing would be satisfactorily arranged. But contrary to all heranticipations, she had to bear a good blowing up from Yuean Yang, and tobe told several unpleasant things by Hsi Jen and P'ing Erh, so that shewas filled with as much shame as indignation. She then came and reportedthe result to Madame Hsing. "It's no use," she said, "she gave me ascolding." But as lady Feng was standing by, she could not summon upcourage enough to allude to P'ing Erh, so she added: "Hsi Jen too helpedher to rate me, and they told me a whole lot of improper words, whichcould not be breathed in a mistress' ears. It would thus be better toarrange with our master to purchase a girl and have done; for from all Isee, neither can that mean vixen enjoy such great good fortune, nor wesuch vast propitious luck!"
"What's that again to do with Hsi Jen? How came they to know anythingabout it?" Madame Hsing exclaimed upon learning the issue. "Who else waspresent?" she proceeded to inquire.
"There was Miss P'ing!" was Chin's wife's reply.
"Shouldn't you have given her a slap on the mouth?" lady Fengprecipitately shouted. "As soon as I ever put my foot outside the door,she starts gadding about; and I never see so much as her shadow, when Iget home. She too is bound to have had a hand in telling you somethingor other!"
"Miss P'ing wasn't present," Chin's wife protested. "Looking from adistance it seemed to me like her; but I couldn't see distinctly. It wasa mere surmise on my part that it was she at all."
"Go and fetch her at once!" lady Feng shouted to a servant. "Tell herthat I've come home, and that Madame Hsing is also here and wants her tohelp her in her hurry."
Feng Erh quickly came up to her. "Miss Lin," she observed, "despatched amessenger for her, and asked her in writing three and four times beforeshe at last went. I advised her to get back so soon as your ladyshipstepped inside the gate, but 'tell your mistress,' Miss Lin said, 'thatI've put her to the inconvenience of coming round, as I've got somethingfor her to do for me.'"
This explanation satisfied lady Feng and she let the matter drop. "Whathas she got to do," she purposely went on to ask, "that she will troubleher day after day?"
Madame Hsing was driven to her wits' ends. As soon as the meal was over,she returned home; and, in the evening, she communicated to Chia She theresult of her errand. After some reflection, Chia She promptly summonedChia Lien.
"There are other people in Nanking to look after our property," he toldhim on his arrival; "there's not only one family, so be quick and deputesome one to go and summon Chin Ts'ai to come up to the capital."
"Last night a letter arrived from Nanking," Chia Lien rejoined, "to theeffect that Chin Ts'ai had been suffering from some phlegm-obstructionin the channels of the heart. So a coffin and money were allowed fromthe other mansion. Whether he be dead or alive now, I don't know. Buteven if alive, he must have lost all consciousness. It would thereforebe a fruitless errand to send for him. His wife, on the other hand, isquite deaf."
Hearing this, Chia She gave vent to an exclamation of reproof, and nextlaunched into abuse. "You stupid and unreasonable rascal!" he shouted."Is it you of all people, who are up to those things? Don't you yetbundle yourself off from my presence?"
Chia Lien withdrew out of the room in a state of trepidation. But in ashort while, (Chia She) gave orders to call Chin Wen-hsiang. Chia Lien(meanwhile) remained in the outer study, for as he neither ventured togo home, nor presumed to face his father, his only alternative was totarry behind. Presently, Chin Wen-hsiang arrived. The servant-lads ledhim straightway past the second gate; and he only came out again andtook his departure after sufficient time had elapsed to enable one tohave four or five meals in.
Chia Lien could not for long summon up courage enough to ask what wasup, but when he found out, after a time, that Chia She had gone tosleep, he eventually crossed over to his quarters. In the course of theevening lady Feng told him the whole story. Then, at last, he understoodthe meaning of the excitement.
But to revert to Yuean Yang. She did not get, the whole night, a wink ofsleep. On the morrow, her brother reported to dowager lady Chia that hewould like to take her home on a visit. Dowager lady Chia accorded herconsent and told her she could go and see her people. Yuean Yang,however, would have rather preferred to stay where she was, but the fearlest her old mistress should give way to suspicion, placed her under thenecessity of going, much against her own inclinations though it was. Herbrother then had no course but to lay before her Chia She's proposal,and all his promises that she would occupy an honourable position, andthat she would be a secondary wife, with control in the house; but YueanYang was so persistent in her refusal that her brother was quitenonplussed and he was compelled to return, and inform Chia She.
Chia She flew into a dreadful passion. "I'll tell you what," he shouted;"bid your wife go and tell her that I say: 'that she must, like thegoddess Ch'ang O herself who has from olden times shown a predilectionfor young people, only despise me for being advanced in years; that, asfar as I can see, she must be hankering after some young men; that itmust, most likely, be Pao-yue; but probably Lien Erh too! If she fostersthese affections, warn her to at once set them at rest; for should shenot come, when I'm ready to have her, who will by and bye venture totake her? This is the first thing. Should she imagine, in the nextplace, that because our venerable senior is fond of her, she may, in thefuture, be engaged to be married in the orthodox way, tell her toconsider carefully that she won't very well be able to escape my grip,no matter in what family she may marry. That it's only in case of herdying or of her not wedding any one throughout her life that I shallsubmit to her decision. Under other circumstances, urge her to seize thefirst opportunity and change her mind, as she'll come in for manybenefits.'"
To every remark that Chia She uttered, Chin Wen-hsiang acquiesced."Yes!" he said.
"Mind you don't humbug me!" Chia She observed. "I shall to-morrow sendagain your mistress round to ask Yuean Yang. If you two have spoken toher, and she hasn't given a favorable answer, well, then, no blame willfall on you. But if she does assent, when she broaches the subject withher, look out for your heads!"
Chin Wen-hsiang eagerly expressed his obedience over and over again, andwithdrawing out of the room, he retraced his footsteps homeward. Nor didhe have the patience to wait until he could commission his womankind tospeak to her. Indeed he went in person and told her face to face theinjunctions entrusted to him. Yuean Yang was incensed to such a degreethat she was at a loss what reply to make. "I'm quite ready to go," sherejoined, after some cogitation, "but you people must take me before myold mistress first and let me tell her something about it."
Her brother and sister-in-law flattered themselves that reflection hadinduced her to alter her previous decision, and they were bothimmeasurably delighted. Her sister-in-law there and then led her intothe upper quarters and ushered her into the presence of old lady Chia.As luck would have it, Madame Wang, Mrs. Hsueeh, Li Wan, lady Feng,Pao-ch'ai and the other girls were, together with several respectableoutside married women who acted as housekeepers, having some fun withold lady Chia. Yuean Yang observed where her mistress was seated, andhastily dragging her sister-in-law before her, she fell on her knees,and explained to her, with tears in her eyes, what proposal Madame Hsinghad made to her, what her sister-in-law, who lived in the garden, hadtold her, and what message her brother had recently conveyed to her. "AsI would not accept his advances," (she continued), "our senior masterhas just now gone so far as to insinuate 'that I was violently attachedto Pao-yue; or if that wasn't the case, my object was to gain time so asto espouse some one outside. That were I even to go up to the veryheavens, I couldn't, during my lifetime, escape his clutches, and thathe would, in the long run, wreak his vengeance on me.' I haveobstinately made up my mind, so I may state in the presence of all ofyou here, that I'll, under no circumstances, marry, as long as I live,any man whatsoever, not to speak of his being a Pao-yue, (precious jade);but even a Pao Chin, (precious gold), a Pao Yin, (precious silver); aPao T'ien Wang, (precious lord of heaven); or a Pao Huang Ti, (preciousEmperor); and have done! Were even your venerable ladyship to press meto take such a step, I couldn't comply with your commands, though youmay threaten to cut my throat with a sword. I'm quite prepared to waitupon your ladyship, till you depart this life; but go with my father,mother, or brother, I won't! I'll either commit suicide, or cut my hairoff, and go and become a nun. If you fancy that I'm not in earnest, andthat I'm temporarily using this language to put you off, may, as surelyas heaven, earth, the spirits, the sun and moon look upon me, my throatbe covered with boils!"
Yuean Yang had, in fact, upon entering the room, brought along a pair ofscissors, concealed in her sleeve, and, while she spoke, she drew herhand back, and, dishevelling her tresses, she began to clip them. Whenthe matrons and waiting-maids saw what she was up to, they hurriedly dideverything they could to induce her to desist from her purpose; butalready half of her locks had gone. And when they found on closeinspection, that with the thick crop of hair she happily had, she hadnot succeeded in cutting it all, they immediately dressed it up for her.
Upon hearing of Chia She's designs, dowager lady Chia was provoked todispleasure. Her whole body trembled and shook. "Of all the attendantsI've had," she cried, "there only remains this single one, upon whom Ican depend, and now they want to conspire and carry her off!" Noticingthen Madame Wang standing close to her, she turned herself towards her."All you people really know is to impose upon me!" she resumed."Outwardly, you display filial devotion; but, secretly, you plot andscheme against me. If I have aught that's worth having, you come and dunme for it. If I have any one who's nice, you come and ask for her.What's left to me is this low waiting-maid, but as you see that sheserves me faithfully, you naturally can't stand it, and you're doingyour utmost to estrange her from me so as to be the better able to playyour tricks upon me."
Madame Wang quickly rose to her feet. She did not, however, dare toreturn a single syllable in self-defence.
Mrs. Hsueeh noticed that Madame Wang herself came in for her share ofblame, and she did not feel as if she could any longer make an attemptto tender words of advice. Li Wan, the moment she heard Yuean Yang speakin the strain she did, seized an early opportunity to lead the youngladies out of the room. T'an Ch'un was a girl with plenty of commonsense, so reflecting within herself that Madame Wang could not, in spiteof the insult heaped upon her, very well presume to say any thing toexculpate herself, that Mrs. Hsueeh could not, of course, in her positionof sister, bring forward any arguments, that Pao-ch'ai was unable toexplain things on behalf of her maternal aunt, and that Li Wan, ladyFeng or Pao-yue could, still less, take upon themselves the right ofcensorship, she thought the opportunity rendered necessary the servicesof a daughter; but, as Ying Ch'un was so quiet, and Hsi Ch'un so young,she consequently walked in, no sooner did she overhear from outside thewindow what was said inside, and forcing a smile, she addressed herselfto her grandmother. "How does this matter concern Madame Wang, mymother?" she interposed. "Venerable senior, just consider! This is amatter affecting her husband's eldest brother; and how could she, ajunior sister-in-law, know anything about it?..."
But before she had exhausted all her arguments, dowager lady Chia'scountenance thawed into a smile. "I've really grown stupid from oldage!" she exclaimed. "Mrs. Hsueeh, don't make fun of me! This eldestsister of yours is most reverent to me; and so unlike that senior ladyof mine, who only knows how to regard her lord and master and to simplydo things for the mere sake of appearances when she deals with hermother-in-law. I've therefore done her a wrong!"
Mrs. Hsueeh confined her reply to a 'yes.' "Dear senior, you're so fullof prejudices," she afterwards observed, "that you love your youngestson's wife more than any one of the others; but it's quite natural."
"I have no prejudices," old lady Chia protested. "Pao-yue," she thenproceeded, "I unjustly found fault with your mother; but, how was itthat even you didn't tell me anything, but that you looked on, while shewas having her feelings trampled upon?"
"Could I," smiled Pao-yue, "have taken my mother's part, and run down mysenior uncle and aunt? If my mother did not bear the whole blame, uponwhom could she throw it? And had I admitted that it was I who wasentirely at fault, you, venerable ancestor, wouldn't have believed me."
"What you say is quite reasonable," his grandmother laughed. "So bequick and fall on your knees before your mother and tell her: 'mother,don't feel aggrieved! Our old lady is so advanced in years. Do it forPao-yue's sake!'"
At this suggestion, Pao-yue hastily crossed over, and dropping on hisknees, he was about to open his lips, when Madame Wang laughingly pulledhim up. "Get up," she cried, "at once! This won't do at all! Is itlikely, pray, that you would tender apologies to me on behalf of ourvenerable ancestor?"
Hearing this, Pao-yue promptly stood up.
"Even that girl Feng didn't call me to my senses," dowager lady Chiasmiled again.
"I don't lay a word to your charge, worthy senior," lady Feng remarkedsmilingly, "and yet you brand me with reproach!"
This rejoinder amused dowager lady Chia. "This is indeed strange!" shesaid to all around. "But I'd like to listen to these charges."
"Who told you, dear senior," lady Feng resumed, "to look after yourattendants so well, and lavish such care on them as to make them plumpand fine as water onions? How ever can you therefore bear people agrudge, if they ask for her hand? I'm, lucky for you, your grandson'swife; for were I your grandson, I would long ere this have proposed toher. Would I have ever waited up to the present?"
"Is this any fault of mine?" dowager lady Chia laughed.
"Of course, it's your fault, venerable senior!" lady Feng retorted witha smile.
"Well, in that case, I too don't want her," old lady Chia proceededlaughing. "Take her away, and have done!"
"Wait until I go through this existence," lady Feng responded, "and, inthe life to come, I'll assume the form of a man and apply for her hand."
"Take her along," dowager lady Chia laughed, "and give her to Lien-Erhto attach to his apartments; and we'll see whether that barefacedfather-in-law of yours will still wish to have her or not."
"Lien-Erh is not a match for her!" lady Feng added. "He's only a fitmate for such as myself and P'ing Erh. A pair of loutish bumpkins likeus to have anything to do with such a one as herself!"
At this rejoinder, they all exploded into a hearty fit of laughter. Buta waiting-maid thereupon announced: "Our senior lady has come." SoMadame Wang immediately quitted the room to go and meet her.
But any further particulars, which you, reader may like to know, will begiven in the following chapter; so listen to it.

CHAPTER XLVII.
  An idiotic bully tries to be lewd and comes in for a sound thrashing.  A cold-hearted fellow is prompted by a dread of trouble to betake      himself to a strange place.
As soon as Madame Wang, so runs our narrative, heard of Madame Hsing'sarrival, she quickly went out to welcome her. Madame Hsing was not yetaware that dowager lady Chia had learnt everything connected with YueanYang's affair, and she was coming again to see which way the wind blew.The moment, however, she stepped inside the courtyard-entrance, severalmatrons promptly explained to her, quite confidentially, that their oldmistress had been told all only a few minutes back, and she meant toretrace her steps, (but she saw that) every inmate in the suite of roomswas already conscious of her presence. When she caught sight, besides,of Madame Wang walking out to meet her she had no option but to enter.First and foremost, she paid her respects to dowager lady Chia, but oldlady Chia did not address her a single remark, so she felt withinherself smitten with shame and remorse.
Lady Feng soon gave something or other as an excuse and withdrew. YueanYang then returned also quite alone to her chamber to give vent to herresentment; and Mrs. Hsueeh, Madame Wang and the other inmates, one byone, retired in like manner, for fear of putting Madame Hsing out ofcountenance. Madame Hsing, however, could not muster courage to beat aretreat. Dowager lady Chia noticed that there was no one but themselvesin her apartments. "I hear," she remarked, "that you had come to playthe part of a go-between for your lord and master! You can very wellobserve the three obediences and four virtues, but this softness ofyours is a work of supererogation! You people have also got now a wholelot of grandchildren and sons. Do you still live in fear and tremblinglest he should put his monkey up? Rumour has it that you yet let thatdisposition of your husband's run riot!"
Madame Hsing's whole face got suffused with blushes. "I advised him timeand again," she explained, "but he wouldn't listen to me. How is it,venerable senior, that you don't yet know that he turns a deaf ear tome? That's why I had no choice in the matter!"
"Would you go and kill any one," dowager lady Chia asked, "that he mightinstigate you to? But consider now. Your brother's wife is naturally aquiet sort of person, and is born with many ailments; but is thereanything, whether large or small, that she doesn't go to the trouble oflooking after? And notwithstanding that that daughter-in-law of yourslends her a helping hand, she is daily so busy that she 'no sooner putsdown the pick than she has to take up the broom.' So busy, that I havemyself now curtailed a hundred and one things. But whenever there'sanything those two can't manage, there's Yuean Yang to come to theirassistance. She is, it's true, a mere child, but nevertheless verycareful; and knows how to concern herself about my affairs a bit;indenting for anything that need be indented, and availing herself of anopportunity to tell them to supply every requisite. Were Yuean Yang notthe kind of girl she is, how could those two ladies not neglect a wholeor part of those matters, both important as well as unimportant,connected with the inner and outer quarters? Would I not at present haveto worry my own mind, instead of leaving things to others? Why, I'ddaily have to rack my brain and go and ask them to give me whatever Imight need! Of those girls, who've come to my quarters and those who'vegone, there only remains this single one. She's, besides other respects,somewhat older in years, and has as well a slight conception of my waysof doing things, and of my tastes. In the second place, she has managedto win her mistresses' hearts, for she never tries to extort aught fromme, or to dun this lady for clothes or that one for money. Hence it isthat beginning from your sister-in-law and daughter-in-law down to theservants in the house, irrespective of old or young, there isn't a soul,who doesn't readily believe every single word she says in anything, nomatter what it is! Not only do I thus have some one upon whom I canrely, but your young sister-in-law and your daughter-in-law are both aswell spared much trouble. With a person such as this by me, should evenmy daughter-in-law and granddaughter-in-law not have the time to thinkof anything, I am not left without it; nor am I given occasion to get mytemper ruffled. But were she now to go, what kind of creature would theyhunt up again to press into my service? Were you even to bring me aperson made of real pearls, she'd be of no use; if she doesn't know howto speak! I was just about to send some one to go and explain to yourhusband that 'I've got money in here enough to buy any girl he fancies,'and to tell him that 'he's at liberty to give for her purchase fromeight to ten thousand taels; that, if he has set his heart upon thisgirl, he can't however have her; and that by leaving her behind toattend to me, during the few years to come, it will be just the same asif he tried to acquit himself of his filial duties by waiting upon meday and night,' so you come at a very opportune moment. Were youtherefore to go yourself at once and deliver him my message, it willanswer the purpose far better!"
These words over, she called the servants. "Go," she said, "and ask Mrs.Hsueeh, and your young mistresses to come! We were in the middle of achat full of zest, and how is it they've all dispersed?"
The waiting-maids immediately assented and left to go in search of theirmistresses, one and all of whom promptly re-entered her apartments, withthe sole exception of Mrs. Hsueeh.
"I've only now returned," she observed to the waiting-maid, "and whatshall I go again for? Just tell her that I'm fast asleep!"
"Dearest Mrs. Hsueeh!" the waiting-maid pleaded, "my worthy senior! ourold mistress will get angry. If you, venerable lady, don't appearnothing will appease her; so do it for the love of us! Should you objectto walking, why I'm quite ready to carry you on my back."
"You little imp!" Mrs. Hsueeh laughed. "What are you afraid of? Allshe'll do will be to scold you a little; and it will all be over soon!"
While replying, she felt that she had no course but to retrace herfootsteps, in company with the waiting-maid.
Dowager lady Chia at once motioned her into a seat. "Let's have a gameof cards!" she then smilingly proposed. "You, Mrs. Hsueeh, are not a goodhand at them; so let's sit together, and see that lady Feng doesn'tcheat us!"
"Quite so," laughed Mrs. Hsueeh. "But it will be well if your venerableladyship would look over my hand a bit! Are we four ladies to play, orare we to add one or two more persons to our number?"
"Naturally only four!" Madame Wang smiled.
"Were one more player let in," lady Feng interposed, "it would bemerrier!"
"Call Yuean Yang here," old lady Chia suggested, "and make her take thislower seat; for as Mrs. Hsueeh's eyesight is rather dim, we'll charge herto look over our two hands a bit."
"You girls know how to read and write," lady Feng remarked with a smile,addressing herself to T'an Ch'un, "and why don't you learnfortune-telling?"
"This is again strange!" T'an Ch'un exclaimed. "Instead of bracing upyour energies now to rook some money out of our venerable senior, youturn your thoughts to fortune-telling!"
"I was just wishing to consult the fates," lady Feng proceeded, "as tohow much I shall lose to-day. Can I ever dream of winning? Why, lookhere. We haven't commenced playing, and they have placed themselves inambush on the left and right."
This remark amused dowager lady Chia and Mrs. Hsueeh. But presently YueanYang arrived, and seated herself below her old mistress. After Yuean Yangsat lady Feng. The red cloth was then spread; the cards were shuffled;the dealer was decided upon and the quintet began to play. After thegame had gone on for a time, Yuean Yang noticed that dowager lady Chiahad a full hand and was only waiting for one two-spotted card, and shemade a secret sign to lady Feng. Lady Feng was about to lead, butpurposely lingered for a few moments. "This card will, for a certainty,be snatched by Mrs. Hsueeh," she smiled, "yet if I don't play this one, Iwon't be able later to come out with what I want."
"I haven't got any cards you want in my hand," Mrs. Hsueeh remarked.
"I mean to see by and bye," lady Feng resumed.
"You're at liberty to see," Mrs. Hsueeh said. "But go on, play now! Letme look what card it is."
Lady Feng threw the card in front of Mrs. Hsueeh. At a glance, Mrs. Hsueehperceived that it was the two spot. "I don't fancy this card," shesmiled. "What I fear is that our dear senior will get a full hand."
"I've played wrong!" lady Feng laughingly exclaimed at these words.
Dowager lady Chia laughed, and throwing down her cards, "If you dare,"she shouted, "take it back! Who told you to play the wrong card?"
"Didn't I want to have my fortune told?" lady Feng observed. "I playedthis card of my own accord, so there's no one with whom I can findfault."
"You should then beat your own lips and punish your own self; it's onlyfair;" old lady Chia remarked. Then facing Mrs. Hsueeh, "I'm not aniggard, fond of winning money," she went on to say, "but it was my goodluck!"
"Don't we too think as much?" Mrs. Hsueeh smiled. "Who's there stupidenough to say that your venerable ladyship's heart is set upon money?"
Lady Feng was busy counting the cash, but catching what was said, sherestrung them without delay. "I've got my share," she said, laughinglyto the company. "It isn't at all that you wish to win. It's your goodluck that made you come out a winner! But as for me, I am really a meancreature; and, as I managed to lose, I count the money and put it awayat once."
Dowager lady Chia usually made Yuean Yang shuffle the cards for her, butbeing engaged in chatting and joking with Mrs. Hsueeh, she did not noticeYuean Yang take them in hand. "Why is it you're so huffed," old lady Chiaasked, "that you don't even shuffle for me?"
"Lady Feng won't let me have the money!" Yuean Yang replied, picking upthe cards.
"If she doesn't give the money," dowager lady Chia observed, "it will bea turning-point in her luck. Take that string of a thousand cash ofhers," she accordingly directed a servant, "and bring it bodily overhere!"
A young waiting-maid actually fetched the string of cash and depositedit by the side of her old mistress.
"Let me have them," lady Feng eagerly cried smiling, "and I'll squareall that's due, and finish."
"In very truth, lady Feng, you're a miserly creature!" Mrs. Hsueehlaughed. "It's simply for mere fun, nothing more!"
Lady Feng, at this insinuation, speedily stood up, and, laying her handon Mrs. Hsueeh, she turned her head round, and pointed at a large woodenbox, in which old lady Chia usually deposited her money. "Aunt," shesaid, a smile curling her lips, "look here! I couldn't tell you how muchthere is in that box that was won from me! This tiao will be wheedled bythe cash in it, before we've played for half an hour! All we've got todo is to give them sufficient time to lure this string in as well; weneedn't trouble to touch the cards. Your temper, worthy ancestor, willthus calm down. If you've also got any legitimate thing for me to do,you might bid me go and attend to it!"
This joke had scarcely been concluded than it evoked incessant laughterfrom dowager lady Chia and every one else. But while she was bandyingwords, P'ing Erh happened to bring her another string of cash promptedby the apprehension that her capital might not suffice to meet herwants.
"It's useless putting them in front of me!" lady Feng cried. "Placethese too over there by our old lady and let them be wheedled in alongwith the others! It will thus save trouble, as there won't be any needto make two jobs of them, to the inconvenience of the cash already inthe box."
Dowager lady Chia had a hearty laugh, so much so, that the cards, sheheld in her hand, flew all over the table; but pushing Yuean Yang. "Bequick," she shouted, "and wrench that mouth of hers!"
P'ing Erh placed the cash according to her mistress' directions. Butafter indulging too in laughter for a time, she retraced her footsteps.On reaching the entrance into the court, she met Chia Lien. "Where'syour Madame Hsing?" he inquired. "Mr. Chia She told me to ask her to goround."
"She's been standing in there with our old mistress," P'ing Erh hastilylaughed, "for ever so long, and yet she isn't inclined to budge! Seizethe earliest opportunity you can get to wash your hands clean of thisbusiness! Our old lady has had a good long fit of fuming and raging.Luckily, our lady Secunda cracked an endless stock of jokes, so she, atlength, got a bit calmer!"
"I'll go over," Chia Lien said. "All I have to do is to find out ourvenerable senior's wishes, as to whether she means to go to Lai Ta'shouse on the fourteenth, so that I might have time to get the chairsready. As I'll be able to tell Madame Hsing to return, and have a shareof the fun, won't it be well for me to go?"
"My idea is," P'ing Erh suggested laughingly, "that you shouldn't putyour foot in there! Every one, even up to Madame Wang, and Pao-yue, havealike received a rap on the knuckles, and are you also going now to fillup the gap?"
"Everything is over long ago," Chia Lien observed, "and can it be thatshe'll cap the whole thing by blowing me up too? What's more, it's noconcern of mine. In the next place, Mr. Chia She enjoined me that I wasto go in person, and ask his wife round, so, if I at present depute someone else, and he comes to know about it, he really won't feel in apleasant mood, and he'll take advantage of this pretext to give vent tohis spite on me."
These words over, he quickly marched off. And P'ing Erh was so impressedwith the reasonableness of his arguments, that she followed in histrack.
As soon as Chia Lien reached the reception hall, he trod with a lightstep. Then peeping in he saw Madame Hsing standing inside. Lady Feng,with her eagle eye, was the first to espy him. But she winked at him anddissuaded him from coming in, and next gave a wink to Madame Hsing.Madame Hsing could not conveniently get away at once, and she had topour a cup of tea, and place it in front of dowager lady Chia. But oldlady Chia jerked suddenly round, and took Chia Lien at such adisadvantage that he found it difficult to beat a retreat. "Who isoutside?" exclaimed old lady Chia. "It seemed to me as if someservant-boy had poked his head in."
Lady Feng sprung to her feet without delay. "I also," she interposed,"indistinctly noticed the shadow of some one."
Saying this, she walked away and quitted the room. Chia Lien enteredwith hasty step. Forcing a smile, "I wanted to ask," he remarked,"whether you, venerable senior, are going out on the fourteenth, so thatthe chairs may be got ready."
"In that case," dowager lady Chia rejoined, "why didn't you comestraight in; but behaved again in that mysterious way?"
"I saw that you were playing at cards, dear ancestor," Chia Lienexplained with a strained laugh, "and I didn't venture to come anddisturb you. I therefore simply meant to call my wife out to find outfrom her."
"Is it anything so very urgent that you had to say it this very moment?"old lady Chia continued. "Had you waited until she had gone home,couldn't you have asked her any amount of questions you may have liked?When have you been so full of zeal before? I'm puzzled to know whetherit isn't as an eavesdropping spirit that you appear on the scene; norcan I say whether you don't come as a spy. But that impish way of yoursgave me quite a start! What a low-bred fellow you are! Your wife willplay at cards with me for a good long while more, so you'd better bundleyourself home, and conspire again with Chao Erh's wife how to do awaywith your better half."
Her remarks evoked general merriment.
"It's Pao Erh's wife," Yuean Yang put in laughingly, "and you, worthysenior, have dragged in again Chao Erh's wife."
"Yes!" assented old lady Chia, likewise with a laugh. "How could Iremember whether he wasn't (pao) embracing her, or (pei) carrying her onhis back. The bare mention of these things makes me lose allself-control and provokes me to anger! Ever since I crossed these doorsas a great grandson's wife, I have never, during the whole of thesefifty-four years, seen anything like these affairs, albeit it has beenmy share to go through great frights, great dangers, thousands ofstrange things and hundred and one remarkable occurrences! Don't you yetpack yourself off from my presence?"
Chia Lien could not muster courage to utter a single word to vindicatehimself, but retired out of the room with all promptitude. P'ing Erh wasstanding outside the window. "I gave you due warning in a gentle tone,but you wouldn't hear; you've, after all, rushed into the very meshes ofthe net!"
These reproaches were still being heaped on him when he caught sight ofMadame Hsing, as she likewise made her appearance outside. "My father,"Chia Lien ventured, "is at the bottom of all this trouble; and the wholeblame now is shoved upon your shoulders as well as mine, mother."
"I'll take you, you unfilial thing and..." Madame Hsing shouted. "Peoplelay down their lives for their fathers; and you are prompted by a fewharmless remarks to murmur against heaven and grumble against earth!Won't you behave in a proper manner? He's in high dudgeon these last fewdays, so mind he doesn't give you a pounding!"
"Mother, cross over at once," Chia Lien urged; "for he told me to comeand ask you to go a long time ago."
Pressing his mother, he escorted her outside as far as the other part ofthe mansion. Madame Hsing gave (her husband) nothing beyond a generaloutline of all that had been recently said; but Chia She found himselfdeprived of the means of furthering his ends. Indeed, so stricken was hewith shame that from that date he pleaded illness. And so little ablewas he to rally sufficient pluck to face old lady Chia, that he merelycommissioned Madame Hsing and Chia Lien to go daily and pay theirrespects to her on his behalf. He had no help too but to despatchservants all over the place to make every possible search and inquiryfor a suitable concubine for him. After a long time they succeeded inpurchasing, for the sum of eighty taels, a girl of seventeen years ofage, Yen Hung by name, whom he introduced as secondary wife into hishousehold.
But enough of this subject. In the rooms on the near side, theyprotracted for a long time their noisy game of cards, and only broke upafter they had something to eat. Nothing worthy of note, however,occurred during the course of the following day or two. In a twinkle,the fourteenth drew near. At an early hour before daybreak, Lai Ta'swife came again into the mansion to invite her guests. Dowager lady Chiawas in buoyant spirits, so taking along Madame Wang, Mrs. Hsueeh, Pao-yueand the various young ladies, she betook herself into Lai Ta's garden,where she sat for a considerable time.
This garden was not, it is true, to be compared with the garden of BroadVista; but it also was most beautifully laid out, and consisted ofspacious grounds. In the way of springs, rockeries, arbours and woods,towers and terraces, pavilions and halls, it likewise contained a goodmany sufficient to excite admiration. In the main hall outside, wereassembled Hsueeh P'an, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Jung and several closerelatives. But Lai Ta had invited as well a number of officials, stillin active service, and numerous young men of wealthy families, to keepthem company. Among that party figured one Liu Hsiang-lien, whom HsueehP'an had met on a previous occasion and kept ever since in constantremembrance. Having besides discovered that he had a passionate likingfor theatricals, and that the parts he generally filled were those of ayoung man or lady, in fast plays, he had unavoidably misunderstood theobject with which he indulged in these amusements, to such a degree asto misjudge him for a young rake. About this time, he had beenentertaining a wish to cultivate intimate relations with him, but hehad, much to his disgust, found no one to introduce him, so when he, bya strange coincidence, came to be thrown in his way, on the presentoccasion, he revelled in intense delight. But Chia Chen and the otherguests had heard of his reputation, so as soon as wine had blinded theirsense of shame, they entreated him to sing two short plays; and whensubsequently they got up from the banquet, they ensconced themselvesnear him, and, pressing him with questions, they carried on aconversation on one thing and then another.
This Liu Hsiang-lien was, in fact, a young man of an old family; but hehad been unsuccessful in his studies, and had lost his father andmother. He was naturally light-hearted and magnanimous; not particularin minor matters; immoderately fond of spear-exercise and fencing, ofgambling and boozing; even going to such excesses as spending his nightsin houses of easy virtue; playing the fife, thrumming the harp, andgoing in for everything and anything. Being besides young in years, andof handsome appearance, those who did not know what his standing was,invariably mistook him for an actor. But Lai Ta's son had all along beenon such friendly terms with him, that he consequently invited him forthe nonce to help him do the honours.
Of a sudden, while every one was, after the wines had gone round, stillon his good behaviour, Hsueeh P'an alone got another fit of his oldmania. From an early stage, his spirits sunk within him and he wouldfain have seized the first convenient moment to withdraw and consummatehis designs but for Lai Shang-jung, who then said: "Our Mr. Pao-yue toldme again just now that although he saw you, as he walked in, he couldn'tspeak to you with so many people present, so he bade me ask you not togo, when the party breaks up, as he has something more to tell you. Butas you insist upon taking your leave, you'd better wait until I call himout, and when you've seen each other, you can get away; I'll havenothing to say then."
While delivering the message, "Go inside," he directed the servant-boys,"and get hold of some old matron and tell her quietly to invite Mr.Pao-yue to come out."
A servant-lad went on the errand, and scarcely had time enough elapsedto enable one to have a cup of tea in, than Pao-yue, actually, made hisappearance outside.
"My dear sir," Lai Shang-jung smilingly observed to Pao-yue, "I hand himover to you. I'm going to entertain the guests!"
With these words, he was off.
Pao-yue pulled Lia Hsiang-lien into a side study in the hall, where theysat down.
"Have you been recently to Ch'in Ch'ung's grave?" he inquired of him.
"How could I not go?" Hsiang-lien answered. "The other day a few of uswent out to give our falcons a fly; and we were yet at a distance of twoli from his tomb, when remembering the heavy rains, we've had thissummer, I gave way to fears lest his grave may not have been proofagainst them; so evading the notice of the party I went over and had alook. I found it again slightly damaged; but when I got back home, Ispeedily raised a few hundreds of cash, and issued early on the thirdday, and hired two men, who put it right."
"It isn't strange then!" exclaimed Pao-yue, "When the lotus blossomedlast month in the pond of our garden of Broad Vista, I plucked ten ofthem and bade T'sai Ming go out of town and lay them as my offering onhis grave. On his return, I also inquired of him: whether it had beendamaged by the water or not; and he explained that not only had it notsustained any harm, but that it looked better than when last he'd seenit. Several of his friends, I argued, must have had it put in properrepair; and I felt it irksome that I should, day after day, be so cagedat home as to be unable to be my own master in the least thing, and thatif even I move, and any one comes to know of it, this one is sure toexhort me, if that one does not restrain me. I can thus afford to brag,but can't manage to act! And though I've got plenty of money, I'm not atliberty to spend any of it!"
"There's no use your worrying in a matter like this!" Liu Hsiang-liensaid. "I am outside, so all you need do is to inwardly foster the wish;that's all. But as the first of the tenth moon will shortly be upon us,I've already prepared the money necessary for going to the graves. Youknow well enough that I'm as poor as a rat; I've no hoardings at home;and when a few cash find their way into my pocket, I soon remain againquite empty-handed. But I'd better make the best of this opportunity,and keep the amount I have, in order that, when the time comes, I mayn'tfind myself without a cash."
"It's exactly about this that I meant to send Pei Ming to see you,"Pao-yue added. "But it isn't often that one can manage to find you athome. I'm well aware how uncertain your movements are; one day you arehere, and another there; you've got no fixed resort."
"There's no need sending any one to hunt me up!" Liu Hsiang-lienreplied. "All that each of us need do in this matter is to acquitourselves of what's right. But in a little while, I again purpose goingaway on a tour abroad, to return in three to five years' time."
When Pao-yue heard his intention, "Why is this?" he at once inquired.
Liu Hsiang-lien gave a sardonic smile. "When my wish is on a fair way tobe accomplished," he said, "you'll certainly hear everything. I must nowleave you."
"After all the difficulty we've had in meeting," Pao-yue remarked,"wouldn't it be better were you and I to go away together in theevening?"
"That worthy cousin of yours," Hsiang-lien rejoined, "is as bad as ever,and were I to stay any longer, trouble would inevitably arise. So it'sas well that I should clear out of his way."
Pao-yue communed with himself for a time. "In that case," he thenobserved, "it's only right, that you should retire. But if you really bebent upon going on a distant tour, you must absolutely tell me somethingbeforehand. Don't, on any account, sneak away quietly!".
As he spoke, the tears trickled down his cheeks.
"I shall, of course, say good-bye to you," Liu Hsiang-lien rejoined."But you must not let any one know anything about it!"
While uttering these words, he stood up to get away. "Go in at once," heurged, "there's no need to see me off!"
Saying this, he quitted the study. As soon as he reached the mainentrance, he came across Hsueeh P'an, bawling out boisterously, "Who letyoung Liu-erh go?"
The moment these shouts fell on Liu Hsiang-lien's ear, his anger flaredup as if it had been sparks spurting wildly about, and he only wished hecould strike him dead with one blow. But on second consideration, hepondered that a fight after the present festive occasion would be aninsult to Lai Shang-jung, and he perforce felt bound to stifle hisindignation.
When Hsueeh P'an suddenly espied him walking out, he looked as delightedas if he had come in for some precious gem. With staggering step he drewnear him. Clutching him with one grip, "My dear brother," he smirked."where are you off to?"
"I'm going somewhere, but will be back soon," Hsiang-lien said by way ofresponse.
"As soon as you left," Hsueeh P'an smiled, "all the fun went. But praysit a while! If you do so, it will be a proof of your regard for me!Don't flurry yourself. With such a senior brother as myself to stand byyou, it will be as easy a job for you to become an official as to reap afortune."
The sight of his repulsive manner filled the heart of Hsiang-lien withdisgust and shame. But speedily devising a plan, he drew him to asecluded spot. "Is your friendship real," he smiled, "or is it only asham?"
This question sent Hsueeh P'an into such raptures that he found itdifficult to check himself from gratifying his longings. But glancing athim with the corner of his eye, "My dear brother," he smiled, "whatmakes you ask me such a thing? If my friendship for you is a sham, may Idie this moment, before your very eyes."
"Well, if that be so," Hsiang-lien proceeded, "it isn't convenient inhere, so sit down and wait a bit. I'll go ahead, but come out of thisyourself by and bye, and follow me to my place, where we can drink thewhole night long. I've also got there two first-rate young fellows whonever go out of doors. But don't bring so much as a single follower withyou, as you'll find, when you get there, plenty of people ready at handto wait on you."
So high did this assignation raise Hsueeh P'an's spirits that herecovered, to a certain extent, from the effects of wine. "Is it reallyso?" he asked.
"How is it," Hsiang-lien laughed, "that when people treat you with asincere heart, you don't, after all, believe them?"
"I'm no fool," eagerly exclaimed Hsueeh P'an, "and how could I notbelieve you? But since this be the case, how am I, who don't even knowthe way, to find your whereabouts if you are to go ahead of me?"
"My place is outside the northern gate." Hsiang-lien explained. "But canyou tear yourself away from your home to spend the night outside thecity walls?"
"As long as you're there," Hsueeh P'an said, "what will I want my homefor?"
"If that be so," Hsiang-lien resumed, "I'll wait for you on the bridgeoutside the northern gate. But let us meanwhile rejoin the banquet andhave some wine. Come along, after you've seen me go; they won't noticeus then."
"Yes!" shouted Hsueeh P'an with alacrity as he acquiesced to theproposal.
The two young fellows thereupon returned to the feast, and drank for atime. Hsueeh Pan, however, could with difficulty endure the suspense. Hekept his gaze intent upon Hsiang-lien; and the more he pondered withinhimself upon what was coming, the more exuberance swelled in his heart.Now he emptied one wine-kettle; now another; and, without waiting forany one to press him, he, of his own accord, gulped down one drink afteranother, with the result that he unconsciously made himself nearly quitetipsy. Hsiang-lien then got up and quitted the room, and perceivingevery one off his guard, he egressed out of the main entrance. "Go homeahead," he directed his page Hsing Nu. "I'm going out of town, but I'llbe back at once."
By the time he had finished giving him these directions, he had alreadymounted his horse, and straightway he proceeded to the bridge beyond thenorthern gate, and waited for Hsueeh P'an. A long while elapsed, however,before he espied Hsueeh P'an in the distance, hurrying along astride of ahigh steed, with gaping mouth, staring eyes, and his head, banging fromside to side like a pedlar's drum. Without intermission, he glancedconfusedly about, sometimes to the left, and sometimes to the right;but, as soon as he got where he had to pass in front of Hsiang-lien'shorse, he kept his gaze fixed far away, and never troubled his mind withthe immediate vicinity.
Hsiang-lien felt amused and angry with him, but forthwith giving hishorse also the rein, he followed in his track, while Hsueeh P'ancontinued to stare ahead.
Little by little the habitations got scantier and scantier, so pullinghis horse round, (Hsueeh P'an) retraced his steps. The moment he turnedback, he unawares caught sight of Hsiang-lien, and his spirits rosewithin him, as if he had got hold of some precious thing of anextraordinary value. "I knew well enough," he eagerly smiled, "that youweren't one to break faith."
"Quick, let's go ahead!" Hsiang-lien smilingly urged. "Mind people mightnotice us and follow us. It won't then be nice!"
While instigating him, he took the lead, and letting his horse have therein, he wended his way onwards, followed closely by Hsueeh P'an. Butwhen Hsiang-lien perceived that the country ahead of them was alreadythinly settled and saw besides a stretch of water covered with a growthof weeds, he speedily dismounted, and tied his horse to a tree. Turningthen round; "Get down!" he said, laughingly, to Hsueeh P'an. "You mustfirst take an oath, so that in the event of your changing your mind inthe future, and telling anything to anyone, the oath might beaccomplished."
"You're quite right!" Hsueeh P'an smiled; and jumping down with alldespatch, he too made his horse fast to a tree, and then crouched on hisknees.
"If I ever in days to come," he exclaimed, "know any change in myfeelings and breathe a word to any living soul, may heaven blast me andearth annihilate me!"
Scarcely had he ended this oath, when a crash fell on his ear, and lo,he felt as if an iron hammer had been brought down to bear upon him frombehind. A black mist shrouded his eyes, golden stars flew wildly aboutbefore his gaze; and losing all control over himself, he sprawled on theground.
Hsiang-lien approached and had a look at him; and, knowing how little hewas accustomed to thrashings, he only exerted but little of hisstrength, and struck him a few blows on the face. But about this time afruit shop happened to open, and Hsueeh P'an strained at first everynerve to rise to his feet, when another slight kick from Hsiang-lientumbled him over again.
"Both parties should really be agreeable," he shouted. "But if you werenot disposed to accept my advances, you should have simply told me in aproper way. And why did you beguile me here to give me a beating?"
So speaking, he went on boisterously to heap invective upon his head.
"I'll take you, you blind fellow, and show you who Mr. Liu is,"Hsiang-lien cried. "You don't appeal to me with solicitous entreaties,but go on abusing me! To kill you would be of no use, so I'll merelygive you a good lesson!"
With these words, he fetched his whip, and administered him, thirty orforty blows from his back down to his shins.
Hsueeh P'an had sobered down considerably from the effects of wine, andfound the stings of pain so intolerable, that little able to restrainhimself, he gave way to groans.
"Do you go on in this way?" Hsiang-lien said, with an ironical smile."Why, I thought you were not afraid of beatings."
While uttering this taunt, he seized Hsueeh P'an by the left leg, anddragging him several steps into a miry spot among the reeds, he rolledhim about till he was covered with one mass of mud. "Do you now knowwhat stuff I'm made of?" he proceeded to ask.
Hsueeh P'an made no reply. But simply lay prostrate, and moaned. Thenthrowing away his whip Hsiang-lien gave him with his fist several thumpsall over the body.
Hsueeh P'an began to wriggle violently and vociferate wildly. "Oh, myribs are broken!" he shouted. "I know you're a proper sort of person!It's all because I made the mistake of listening to other people'sgossip!"
"There's no need for you to drag in other people!" Hsiang-lien went on."Just confine yourself to those present!"
"There's nothing up at present!" Hsueeh P'an cried. "From what you say,you're a person full of propriety. So it's I who am at fault."
"You'll have to speak a little milder," Hsiang-lien added, "before I letyou off."
"My dear younger brother," Hsueeh P'an pleaded, with a groan.
Hsiang-lien at this struck him another blow with his fist.
"Ai!" ejaculated Hsueeh P'an. "My dear senior brother!" he exclaimed.
Hsiang-lien then gave him two more whacks, one after the other.
"Ai Yo!" Hsueeh P'an precipitately screamed. "My dear Sir, do spare me,an eyeless beggar; and henceforth I'll look up to you with veneration;I'll fear you!"
"Drink two mouthfuls of that water!" shouted Hsiang-lien.
"That water is really too foul," Hsueeh P'an argued, in reply to thissuggestion, wrinkling his eyebrows the while; "and how could I put anyof it in my mouth?"
Hsiang-lien raised his fist and struck him.
"I'll drink it, I'll drink it!" quickly bawled Hsueeh P'an.
So saying, he felt obliged to lower his head to the very roots of thereeds and drink a mouthful. Before he had had time to swallow it, asound of 'ai' became audible, and up came all the stuff he had put intohis mouth only a few seconds back.
"You filthy thing!" exclaimed Hsiang-lien. "Be quick and finishdrinking; and I'll let you off."
Upon hearing this, Hsueeh P'an bumped his head repeatedly on the ground."Do please," he cried, "lay up a store of meritorious acts for yourselfand let me off! I couldn't take that were I even on the verge of death!"
"This kind of stench will suffocate me!" Hsiang-lien observed, and, withthis remark, he abandoned Hsueeh Pan to his own devices; and, pulling hishorse, he put his foot to the stirrup, and rode away.
Hsueeh Pan, meanwhile, became aware of his departure, and felt at lastrelieved in his mind. Yet his conscience pricked him for he saw that heshould not misjudge people. He then made an effort to raise himself, butthe racking torture he experienced all over his limbs was so sharp thathe could with difficulty bear it.
Chia Chen and the other guests present at the banquet became, as ithappened, suddenly alive to the fact that the two young fellows haddisappeared; but though they extended their search everywhere, they sawnothing of them. Some one insinuated, in an uncertain way, that they hadgone outside the northern gate; but as Hsueeh P'an's pages had ever livedin dread of him, who of them had the audacity to go and hunt him upafter the injunctions, he had given them, that they were not to followhim? But waxing solicitous on his account, Chia Chen subsequently badeChia Jung take a few servant-boys and go and discover some clue of him,or institute inquiries as to his whereabouts. Straightway therefore theyprosecuted their search beyond the northern gate, to a distance of twoli below the bridge, and it was quite by accident that they discernedHsueeh P'an's horse made fast by the side of a pit full of reeds.
"That's a good sign!" they with one voice exclaimed; "for if the horseis there, the master must be there too!"
In a body, they thronged round the horse, when, from among the reeds,they caught the sound of human groans, so hurriedly rushing forward toascertain for themselves, they, at a glance, perceived Hsueeh P'an, hiscostume all in tatters, his countenance and eyes so swollen and bruisedthat it was hard to make out the head and face, and his whole person,inside as well as outside his clothes, rolled like a sow in a heap ofmud.
Chia Jung surmised pretty nearly the truth. Speedily dismounting, hetold the servants to prop him up. "Uncle Hsueeh," he laughed, "you dailygo in for lewd dalliance; but have you to-day come to dissipate in areed-covered pit? The King of the dragons in this pit must have alsofallen in love with your charms, and enticed you to become hisson-in-law that you've come and gored yourself on his horns like this!"
Hsueeh P'an was such a prey to intense shame that he would fain havegrovelled into some fissure in the earth had he been able to detect any.But so little able was he to get on his horse that Chia Jung directed aservant to run to the suburbs and fetch a chair. Ensconced in this,Hsueeh P'an entered town along with the search party.
Chia Jung still insisted upon carrying him to Lai Ta's house to join thefeast, so Hsueeh P'an had to make a hundred and one urgent appeals to himto tell no one, before Chia Jung eventually yielded to his solicitationsand allowed him to have his own way and return home.
Chia Jung betook himself again to Lai Ta's house, and narrated to ChiaChen their recent experiences. When Chia Chen also learnt of theflogging (Hsueeh P'an) had received from Hsiang-lien, he laughed. "It'sonly through scrapes," he cried, "that he'll get all right!"
In the evening, after the party broke up, he came to inquire after him.But Hsueeh P'an, who was lying all alone in his bedroom, nursing himself,refused to see him, on the plea of indisposition.
When dowager lady Chia and the other inmates had returned home, andevery one had retired into their respective apartments, Mrs. Hsueeh andPao-ch'ai observed that Hsiang Ling's eyes were quite swollen fromcrying, and they questioned her as to the reason of her distress. (Onbeing told), they hastily rushed to look up Hsueeh P'an; but, though theysaw his body covered with scars, they could discover no ribs broken, orbones dislocated.
Mrs. Hsueeh fell a prey to anguish and displeasure. At one time, shescolded Hsueeh P'an; at another, she abused Liu Hsiang-lien. Her wish wasto lay the matter before Madame Wang in order that some one should bedespatched to trace Liu Hsiang-lien and bring him back, but Pao-ch'aispeedily dissuaded her. "It's nothing to make a fuss about," sherepresented. "They were simply drinking together; and quarrels after awine bout are ordinary things. And for one who's drunk to get a fewwhacks more or less is nothing uncommon! Besides, there's in our homeneither regard for God nor discipline. Every one knows it. If it'spurely out of love, mother, that you desire to give vent to your spite,it's an easy matter enough. Have a little patience for three or fivedays, until brother is all right and can go out. Mr. Chia Chen and Mr.Chia Lien over there are not people likely to let the affair dropwithout doing anything! They'll, for a certainty, stand a treat, and askthat fellow, and make him apologise and admit his wrong in the presenceof the whole company, so that everything will be properly settled. Butwere you now, ma, to begin making much of this occurrence, and tellingevery one, it would, on the contrary, look as if you had, in yourmotherly partiality and fond love for him, indulged him to stir up a rowand provoke people! He has, on this occasion, had unawares to eat humblepie, but will you, ma, put people to all this trouble and inconvenienceand make use of the prestige enjoyed by your relatives to oppress anordinary person?"
"My dear child," Mrs. Hsueeh rejoined, "after listening to the adviceproffered by her, you've, after all, been able to foresee all thesethings! As for me, that sudden fit of anger quite dazed me!"
"All will thus be square," Pao-ch'ai smiled, "for, as he's neitherafraid of you, mother, nor gives an ear to people's exhortations, butgets wilder and wilder every day that goes by, he may, if he gets two orthree lessons, turn over a new leaf."
While Hsueeh P'an lay on the stovecouch, he reviled Hsiang-lien with allhis might. Next, he instigated the servant-boys to go and demolish hishouse, kill him and bring a charge against him. But Mrs. Hsueeh hinderedthe lads from carrying out his purpose, and explained to her son: "thatLiu Hsiang-lien had casually, after drinking, behaved in a disorderlyway, that now that he was over the effects of wine, he was exceedinglyfilled with remorse, and that, prompted by the fear of punishment, hehad effected his escape."
But, reader, if you feel any interest to know what happened when HsueehP'an heard the version his mother gave him, listen to what you will findin the next chapter.

CHAPTER XLVIII.
  A sensual-minded man gets into such trouble through his sensuality      that he entertains the idea of going abroad.  An estimable and refined girl manages, after great exertion, to      compose verses at a refined meeting.
But to resume our story. After hearing his mother's arguments, HsueehP'an's indignation gradually abated. But notwithstanding that his painsand aches completely disappeared, in three or five days' time, the scarsof his wounds were not yet healed and shamming illness, he remained athome; so ashamed was he to meet any of his relations or friends.
In a twinkle, the tenth moon drew near; and as several among thepartners in the various shops, with which he was connected, wanted to gohome, after the settlement of the annual accounts, he had to give them afarewell spread at home. In their number was one Chang Te-hui, who fromhis early years filled the post of manager in Hsueeh P'an's pawnshop; andwho enjoyed in his home a living of two or three thousand taels. Hispurpose too was to visit his native place this year, and to return thefollowing spring.
"Stationery and perfumery have been so scarce this year," heconsequently represented, "that prices will next year inevitably behigh; so when next year comes, what I'll do will be to send up my elderand younger sons ahead of me to look after the pawnshop, and when Istart on my way back, before the dragon festival, I'll purchase a stockof paper, scents and fans and bring them for sale. And though we'll haveto reduce the duties, payable at the barriers, and other expenses, therewill still remain for us a considerable percentage of profit."
This proposal set Hsueeh P'an musing, "With the dressing I've recentlyhad," he pondered, "I cannot very well, at present, appear before anyone. Were the fancy to take me to get out of the way for half a year oreven a year, there isn't a place where I can safely retire. And to shamillness, day after day, isn't again quite the right thing! In additionto this, here I've reached this grown-up age, and yet I'm neither acivilian nor a soldier. It's true I call myself a merchant; but I'venever in point of fact handled the scales or the abacus. Nor do I knowanything about our territories, customs and manners, distances androutes. So wouldn't it be advisable that I should also get ready some ofmy capital, and go on a tour with Chang Te-hui for a year or so? WhetherI earn any money or not, will be equally immaterial to me. More, I shallescape from all disgrace. It will, secondly, be a good thing for me tosee a bit of country."
This resolution once arrived at in his mind, he waited until they rosefrom the banquet, when he, with calmness and equanimity, brought hisplans to Chang Te-hui's cognizance, and asked him to postpone hisdeparture for a day or two so that they should proceed on the journeytogether.
In the evening, he imparted the tidings to his mother. Mrs. Hsueeh, uponhearing his intention, was albeit delighted, tormented with freshmisgivings lest he should stir up trouble abroad,--for as far as theexpense was concerned she deemed it a mere bagatelle,--and sheconsequently would not permit him to go. "You have," she reasoned withhim, "to take proper care of me, so that I may be able to live in peace.Another thing is, that you can well dispense with all this buying andselling, for you are in no need of the few hundreds of taels, you maymake."
Hsueeh P'an had long ago thoroughly resolved in his mind what to do andhe did not therefore feel disposed to listen to her remonstrances. "Youdaily tax me," he pleaded, "with being ignorant of the world, with notknowing this, and not learning that, and now that I stir up my goodresolution, with the idea of putting an end to all trifling, and that Iwish to become a man, to do something for myself, and learn how to carryon business, you won't let me! But what would you have me do? BesidesI'm not a girl that you should coop me up at home! And when is thislikely to come to an end? Chang Te-hui is, moreover, a man well up inyears; and he is an old friend of our family, so if I go with him, however will I be able to do anything that's wrong? Should I at any time beguilty of any impropriety, he will be sure to speak to me, and to exhortme. He even knows the prices of things and customs of trade; and as Ishall, as a matter of course, consult him in everything, what advantagewon't I enjoy? But if you refuse to let me go, I'll wait for a couple ofdays, and, without breathing a word to any one at home, I'll furtivelymake my preparations and start, and, when by next year I shall have mademy fortune and come back, you'll at length know what stuff I'm madeoff!"
When he had done speaking, he flew into a huff and went off to sleep.
Mrs. Hsueeh felt impelled, after the arguments she heard him propound, todeliberate with Pao-ch'ai.
"If brother," Pao-ch'ai smilingly rejoined, "were in real earnest aboutgaining experience in some legitimate concerns, it would be well andgood. But though he speaks, now that he is at home, in a plausiblemanner, the moment he gets abroad, his old mania will break out again,and it will be hard to exercise any check over him. Yet, it isn't worththe while distressing yourself too much about him! If he does actuallymend his ways, it will be the happiness of our whole lives. But if hedoesn't change, you won't, mother, be able to do anything more; forthough, in part, it depends on human exertion, it, in part, depends uponthe will of heaven! If you keep on giving way to fears that, with hislack of worldly experience, he can't be fit to go abroad and can't be upto any business, and you lock him up at home this year, why next yearhe'll be just the same! Such being the case, you'd better, ma,--sincehis arguments are right and specious enough,--make up your mind tosacrifice from eight hundred to a thousand taels and let him have themfor a try. He'll, at all events, have one of his partners to lend him ahelping hand, one who won't either think it a nice thing to play any ofhis tricks upon him. In the second place, there will be, when he's gone,no one to the left of him or to the right of him, to stand by him, andno one upon whom to rely, for when one goes abroad, who cares for anyone else? Those who have, eat; and those who haven't starve. When hetherefore casts his eyes about him and realises that there's no one todepend upon, he may, upon seeing this, be up to less mischief than werehe to stay at home; but of course, there's no saying."
Mrs. Hsueeh listened to her, and communed within herself for a moment."What you say is, indeed, right and proper!" she remarked. "And couldone, by spending a small sum, make him learn something profitable, itwill be well worth!"
They then matured their plans; and nothing further of any notetranspired during the rest of the night.
The next day, Mrs. Hsueeh sent a messenger to invite Chang Te-hui to comeround. On his arrival, she charged Hsueeh P'an to regale him in thelibrary. Then appearing, in person, outside the window of the coveredback passage, she made thousand of appeals to Chang Te-hui to look afterher son and take good care of him.
Chang Te-hui assented to her solicitations with profuse assurances, andtook his leave after the collation.
"The fourteenth," he went on to explain to Hsueeh P'an. "is a propitiousday to start. So, worthy friend, you'd better be quick and pack up yourbaggage, and hire a mule, for us to begin our long journey as soon asthe day dawns on the fourteenth."
Hsueeh P'an was intensely gratified, and he communicated their plans toMrs. Hsueeh. Mrs. Hsueeh then set to, and worked away, with the assistanceof Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang Ling and two old nurses, for several consecutivedays, before she got his luggage ready. She fixed upon the husband ofHsueeh P'an's nurse an old man with hoary head, two old servants withample experience and long services, and two young pages, who acted asHsueeh P'an's constant attendants, to go with him as his companions, sothe party mustered, inclusive of master and followers, six persons inall. Three large carts were hired for the sole purpose of carrying thebaggage and requisites; and four mules, suitable for long journeys, werelikewise engaged. A tall, dark brown, home-bred mule was selected forHsueeh P'an's use; but a saddle horse, as well, was provided for him.
After the various preparations had been effected, Mrs. Hsueeh, Pao-ch'aiand the other inmates tendered him, night after night, words of advice.But we can well dispense with dilating on this topic. On the arrival ofthe thirteenth, Hsueeh P'an went and bade good-bye to his maternaluncles. After which, he came and paid his farewell visit to the membersof the Chia household. Chia Chen and the other male relativesunavoidably prepared an entertainment to speed him off. But to thesefestivities, there is likewise little need to allude with anyminuteness.
On the fourteenth, at break of day, Mrs. Hsueeh, Pao-ch'ai and the othermembers of the family accompanied Hsueeh P'an beyond the ceremonial gate.Here his mother and her daughter stood and watched him, their four eyesfixed intently on him, until he got out of sight, when they, at length,retraced their footsteps into the house.
Mrs. Hsueeh had, in coming up to the capital, only brought four or fivefamily domestics and two or three old matrons and waiting-maids withher, so, after the departure on the recent occasion, of those, whofollowed Hsueeh P'an, no more than one or two men-servants remained inthe outer quarters. Mrs. Hsueeh repaired therefore on the very same dayinto the study, and had the various ornaments, bric-a-brac, curtains andother articles removed into the inner compound and put away. Thenbidding the wives of the two male attendants, who had gone with HsueehP'an, likewise move their quarters inside, along with the other women,she went on to impress upon Hsiang Ling to put everything carefully awayin her own room as well, and to lock the doors; "for," (she said), "youmust come at night and sleep with me."
"Since you've got all these people to keep you company, ma," Pao-ch'airemarked, "wouldn't it be as well to tell sister Ling to come and be mycompanion? Our garden is besides quite empty and the nights are so long!And as I work away every night, won't it be better for me to have anextra person with me?"
"Quite so!" smiled Mrs. Hsueeh, "I forgot that! I should have told her togo with you; it's but right. It was only the other day that I mentionedto your brother that: 'Wen Hsing too was young, and not fit to attend toeverything that turns up, that Ying Erh could not alone do all thewaiting, and that it was necessary to purchase another girl for yourservice.'"
"If we buy one, we won't know what she's really like!" Pao-ch'aidemurred. "If she gives us the slip, the money we may have spent on herwill be a mere trifle, so long as she hasn't been up to any pranks! Solet's quietly make inquiries, and, when we find one with well-knownantecedents, we can purchase her, and, we'll be on the safe side then!"
While speaking, she told Hsiang Ling to collect her bedding and clothes;and desiring an old matron and Ch'in Erh to take them over to the HengWu Yuean, Pao-ch'ai returned at last into the garden in company withHsiang Ling.
"I meant to have proposed to my lady," Hsiang Ling said to Pao-ch'ai,"that, when master left, I should be your companion, miss; but I fearedlest her ladyship should, with that suspicious mind of hers, havemaintained that I was longing to come into the garden to romp. But who'dhave thought it, it was you, after all, who spoke to her about it!"
"I am well aware," Pao-ch'ai smiled, "that you've been inwardly yearningfor this garden, and that not for a day or two, but with the little timeyou can call your own, you would find it no fun, were you even able torun over once in a day, so long as you have to do it in a hurry-scurry!Seize therefore this opportunity of staying, better still, for a year;as I, on my side, will then have an extra companion; and you, on yours,will be able to accomplish your wishes."
"My dear miss!" laughingly observed Hsiang Ling, "do let's make the bestof this time, and teach me how to write verses!"
"I say," Pao-ch'ai laughed, "'you no sooner, get the Lung state than youlong for the Shu'! I advise you to wait a bit. This is the first daythat you spend in here, and you should, first and foremost, go out ofthe garden by the eastern side gate and look up and salute every one inher respective quarters commencing from our old lady. But you needn'tmake it a point of telling them that you've moved into the garden. Ifanyone does allude to the reason why you've shifted your quarters, youcan simply explain cursorily that I've brought you in as a companion,and then drop the subject. On your return by and bye into the garden,you can pay a visit to the apartments of each of the young ladies."
Hsiang Ling signified her acquiescence, and was about to start when shesaw P'ing Erh rush in with hurried step. Hsiang Ling hastened to askafter her health, and P'ing Erh felt compelled to return her smile, andreciprocate her inquiry.
"I've brought her in to-day," Pao-ch'ai thereupon smilingly said toP'ing Erh, "to make a companion of her. She was just on the point ofgoing to tell your lady about it!"
"What is this that you're saying, Miss?" P'ing Erh rejoined, with asmile. "I really am at a loss what reply to make to you!"
"It's the right thing!" Pao-ch'ai answered. "' In a house, there's themaster, and in a temple there's the chief priest.' It's true, it's noimportant concern, but something must, in fact, be mentioned, so thatthose, who sit up on night duty in the garden, may be aware that thesetwo have been added to my rooms, and know when to close the gates andwhen to wait. When you get back therefore do mention it, so that Imayn't have to send some one to tell them."
P'ing Erh promised to carry out her wishes. "As you're moved in here,"she said to Hsiang Ling, "won't you go and pay your respects to yourneighbours?"
"I had just this very moment," Pao-ch'ai smiled, "told her to go and doso."
"You needn't however go to our house," P'ing Erh remarked, "our Mr.Secundus is laid up at home."
Hsiang Ling assented and went off, passing first and foremost by dowagerlady Chia's apartments. But without devoting any of our attention toher, we will revert to P'ing Erh.
Seeing Hsiang Ling walk out of the room, she drew Pao-ch'ai near her."Miss! have you heard our news?" she inquired in a low tone of voice.
"I haven't heard any news," Pao-ch'ai responded. "We've been daily sobusy in getting my brother's things ready for his voyage abroad, that weknow nothing whatever of any of your affairs in here. I haven't evenseen anything of my female cousins these last two days."
"Our master, Mr. Chia She, has beaten our Mr. Secundus to such a degreethat he can't budge," P'ing Erh smiled. "But is it likely, miss, thatyou've heard nothing about it?"
"This morning," Pao-ch'ai said by way of reply, "I heard a vague reporton the subject, but I didn't believe it could be true. I was just aboutto go and look up your mistress, when you unexpectedly arrived. But whydid he beat him again?"
P'ing Erh set her teeth to and gave way to abuse. "It's all on accountof some Chia Yue-ts'un or other; a starved and half-dead boorish bastard,who went yonder quite unexpectedly. It isn't yet ten years, since we'veknown him, and he has been the cause of ever so much trouble! In thespring of this year, Mr. Chia She saw somewhere or other, I can't tellwhere, a lot of antique fans; so, when on his return home, he noticedthat the fine fans stored away in the house, were all of no use, he atonce directed servants to go everywhere and hunt up some like those hehad seen. Who'd have anticipated it, they came across a recklesscreature of retribution, dubbed by common consent the 'stone fool,' whothough so poor as to not even have any rice to put to his mouth,happened to have at home twenty antique fans. But these he utterlyrefused to take out of his main door. Our Mr. Secundus had thus aprecious lot of bother to ask ever so many favours of people. But whenhe got to see the man, he made endless appeals to him before he couldget him to invite him to go and sit in his house; when producing thefans, he allowed him to have a short inspection of them. From what ourMr. Secundus says, it would be really difficult to get any the like ofthem. They're made entirely of spotted black bamboo, and the stags andjadelike clusters of bamboo on them are the genuine pictures, drawn bymen of olden times. When he got back, he explained these things to Mr.Chia She, who readily asked him to buy them, and give the man his ownprice for them. The 'stone fool,' however, refused. 'Were I even to bedying from hunger,' he said, 'or perishing from frostbites, and so muchas a thousand taels were offered me for each single fan, I wouldn't partwith them.' Mr. Chia She could do nothing, but day after day he abusedour Mr. Secundus as a good-for-nothing. Yet he had long ago promised theman five hundred taels, payable cash down in advance, before delivery ofthe fans, but he would not sell them. 'If you want the fans,' he hadanswered, 'you must first of all take my life.' Now, miss, do considerwhat was to be done? But, Yue-ts'un is, as it happens, a man with noregard for divine justice. Well, when he came to hear of it, he at oncedevised a plan to lay hold of these fans, so fabricating the chargeagainst him of letting a government debt drag on without payment, he hadhim arrested and brought before him in the Yamen; when he adjudicatedthat his family property should be converted into money to make up theamount due to the public chest; and, confiscating the fans in question,he set an official value on them and sent them over here. And as forthat 'stone fool,' no one now has the faintest idea whether he be deador alive. Mr. Chia She, however, taunted Mr. Secundus. 'How is it,' hesaid, 'that other people can manage to get them?' Our master simplyrejoined 'that to bring ruin upon a person in such a trivial mattercould not be accounted ability.' But, at these words, his fathersuddenly rushed into a fury, and averred that Mr. Secundus had saidthings to gag his mouth. This was the main cause. But several minormatters, which I can't even recollect, also occurred during these lastfew days. So, when all these things accumulated, he set to work and gavehim a sound thrashing. He didn't, however, drag him down and strike himwith a rattan or cane, but recklessly assaulted him, while he stoodbefore him, with something or other, which he laid hold of, and brokehis face open in two places. We understand that Mrs. Hsueeh has in heresome medicine or other for applying on wounds, so do try, miss, and finda ball of it and let me have it!"
Hearing this, Pao-ch'ai speedily directed Ying Erh to go and look forsome, and, on discovering two balls of it, she brought them over andhanded them to P'ing Erh.
"Such being the case," Pao-ch'ai said, "do make, on your return, theusual inquiries for me, and I won't then need to go."
P'ing Erh turned towards Pao-ch'ai, and expressed her readiness toexecute her commission, after which she betook herself home, where wewill leave her without further notice.
After Hsiang Ling, for we will take up the thread of our narrative withher, completed her visits to the various inmates, she had her eveningmeal. Then when Pao-ch'ai and every one else went to dowager lady Chia'squarters, she came into the Hsiao Hsiang lodge. By this time Tai-yue hadgot considerably better. Upon hearing that Hsiang Ling had also movedinto the garden, she, needless to say, was filled with delight.
"Now, that I've come in here," Hsiang Ling then smiled and said, "doplease teach me, at your leisure, how to write verses. It will be a bitof good luck for me if you do."
"Since you're anxious to learn how to versify," Tai-yue answered with asmile, "you'd better acknowledge me as your tutor; for though I'm not agood hand at poetry, yet I know, after all, enough to be able to teachyou."
"Of course you do!" Hsiang Ling laughingly remarked. "I'll readily treatyou as my tutor. But you mustn't put yourself to any trouble!"
"Is there anything so difficult about this," Tai-yue pursued, "as to makeit necessary to go in for any study? Why, it's purely and simply amatter of openings, elucidations, embellishments and conclusions. Theelucidations and embellishments, which come in the centre, should formtwo antithetical sentences, the even tones must pair with the uneven.Empty words must correspond with full words; and full words with emptywords. In the event of any out-of-the-way lines, it won't matter if theeven and uneven tones, and the empty and full words do not pair."
"Strange though it may appear," smiled Hsiang Ling, "I often handlebooks with old poems, and read one or two stanzas, whenever I can stealthe time; and some among these I find pair most skilfully, while othersdon't. I have also heard that the first, third and fifth lines are of noconsequence; and that the second, fourth and sixth must be clearlydistinguished. But I notice that there are in the poetical works ofancient writers both those which accord with the rules, as well as thosewhose second, fourth and sixth lines are not in compliance with anyrule. Hence it is that my mind has daily been full of doubts. But afterthe hints you've given me, I really see that all these formulas are ofno account, and that the main requirement is originality of diction."
"Yes, that's just the principle that holds good," Tai-yue answered. "Butdiction is, after all, a last consideration. The first and foremostthing is the choice of proper sentiments; for when the sentiments arecorrect, there'll even be no need to polish the diction; it's certain tobe elegant. This is called versifying without letting the diction affectthe sentiments."
"What I admire," Hsiang Ling proceeded with a smile; "are the lines byold Lu Fang;
 "The double portiere, when not raised, retains the fragrance long.  An old inkslab, with a slight hole, collects plenty of ink.
"Their language is so clear that it's charming."
"You must on no account," Tai-yue observed, "read poetry of the kind.It's because you people don't know what verses mean that you, no soonerread any shallow lines like these, than they take your fancy. But whenonce you get into this sort of style, it's impossible to get out of it.Mark my words! If you are in earnest about learning, I've got here WangMo-chieh's complete collection; so you'd better take his one hundredstanzas, written in the pentameter rule of versification, and carefullystudy them, until you apprehend them thoroughly. Afterwards, look overthe one hundred and twenty stanzas of Lao T'u, in the heptameter rule;and next read a hundred or two hundred of the heptameter four-linedstanzas by Li Ch'ing-lieu. When you have, as a first step, digestedthese three authors, and made them your foundation, you can take T'aoYuan-ming, Ying, Liu, Hsieh, Yuean, Yue, Pao and other writers and gothrough them once. And with those sharp and quick wits of yours, I've nodoubt but that you will become a regular poet before a year's time."
"Well, in that case," Hsiang Ling smiled, after listening to her, "bringme the book, my dear miss, so that I may take it along. It will be agood thing if I can manage to read several stanzas at night."
At these words, Tai-yue bade Tzu Chuean fetch Wang Tso-ch'eng's pentameterstanzas. When brought, she handed them to Hsiang Ling. "Only perusethose marked with red circles" she said. "They've all been selected byme. Read each one of them; and should there be any you can't fathom, askyour miss about them. Or when you come across me, I can explain them toyou."
Hsiang Ling took the poems and repaired back to the Heng Wu-yuean. Andwithout worrying her mind about anything she approached the lamp andbegan to con stanza after stanza. Pao-ch'ai pressed her, severalconsecutive times, to go to bed; but as even rest was far from herthoughts, Pao-ch'ai let her, when she perceived what trouble she wastaking over her task, have her own way in the matter.
Tai-yue had one day just finished combing her hair and performing herablutions, when she espied Hsiang Ling come with smiles playing abouther lips, to return her the book and to ask her to let her have T'u'spoetical compositions in exchange.
"Of all these, how many stanzas can you recollect?" Tai-yue asked,smiling.
"I've read every one of those marked with a red circle," Hsiang Linglaughingly rejoined.
"Have you caught the ideas of any of them, yes or no?" Tai-yue inquired.
"Yes, I've caught some!" Hsiang Ling smiled. "But whether rightly or notI don't know. Let me tell you."
"You must really," Tai-yue laughingly remarked, "minutely solicitpeople's opinions if you want to make any progress. But go on and let mehear you."
"From all I can see," Hsiang Ling smiled, "the beauty of poetry lies incertain ideas, which though not quite expressible in words are,nevertheless, found, on reflection, to be absolutely correct. Some mayhave the semblance of being totally devoid of sense, but, on secondthought, they'll truly be seen to be full of sense and feeling."
"There's a good deal of right in what you say," Tai-yue observed. "But Iwonder how you arrived at this conclusion?"
"I notice in that stanza on 'the borderland,' the antithetical couplet:
 "In the vast desert reigns but upright mist.  In the long river setteth the round sun.
"Consider now how ever can mist be upright? The sun is, of course, round.But the word 'upright' would seem to be devoid of common sense; and'round' appears far too commonplace a word. But upon throwing the wholepassage together, and pondering over it, one fancies having seen thescenery alluded to. Now were any one to suggest that two othercharacters should be substituted for these two, one would verily be hardpressed to find any other two as suitable. Besides this, there's alsothe couplet:
 "When the sun sets, rivers and lakes are white;  When the mist falls, the heavens and earth azure.
"Both 'white' and 'azure', apparently too lack any sense; but reflectionwill show that these two words are absolutely necessary to bring outthoroughly the aspect of the scenery. And in conning them over, onefeels just as if one had an olive, weighing several thousands ofcatties, in one's mouth, so much relish does one derive from them. Butthere's this too:
 "At the ferry stays the setting sun,  O'er the mart hangs the lonesome mist.
"And how much trouble must these words 'stay,' and 'over, have caused theauthor in their conception! When the boats made fast, in the evening ofa certain day of that year in which we came up to the capital, the bankswere without a trace of human beings; and there were only just a fewtrees about; in the distance loomed the houses of several familiesengaged in preparing their evening meal, and the mist was, in fact,azure like jade, and connected like clouds. So, when I, as it happened,read this couplet last night, it actually seemed to me as if I had comeagain to that spot!"
But in the course of their colloquy, Pao-yue and T'an Ch'un arrived; andentering the room, they seated themselves, and lent an ear to herarguments on the verses.
"Seeing that you know so much," Pao-yue remarked with a smiling face,"you can dispense with reading poetical works, for you're not far offfrom proficiency. To hear you expatiate on these two lines, makes itevident to my mind that you've even got at their secret meaning."
"You say," argued Tai-yue with a significant smile, "that the line:
 "'O'er (the mart) hangs the lonesome mist,'
"is good; but aren't you yet aware that this is only plagiarised from anancient writer? But I'll show you the line I'm telling you of. You'llfind it far plainer and clearer than this."
While uttering these words, she turned up T'ao Yuean-ming's,
  Dim in the distance lies a country place;  Faint in the hamlet-market hangs the mist;
and handed it to Hsiang Ling.
Hsiang Ling perused it, and, nodding her head, she eulogised it."Really," she smiled, the word 'over' is educed from the two charactersimplying 'faint.'
Pao-yue burst out into a loud fit of exultant laughter. "You've alreadygot it!" he cried. "There's no need of explaining anything more to you!Any further explanations will, in lieu of benefiting you, make youunlearn what you've learnt. Were you therefore to, at once, set to work,and versify, your lines are bound to be good."
"To-morrow," observed T'an ch'un with a smile; "I'll stand an extratreat and invite you to join the society."
"Why make a fool of me, miss?" Hsiang Ling laughingly ejaculated. "It'smerely that mania of mine that made me apply my mind to this subject atall; just for fun and no other reason."
T'an Ch'un and Tai-yue both smiled. "Who doesn't go in for these thingsfor fun?" they asked. "Is it likely that we improvise verses in realearnest? Why, if any one treated our verses as genuine verses, and tookthem outside this garden, people would have such a hearty laugh at ourexpense that their very teeth would drop."
"This is again self-violence and self-abasement!" Pao-yue interposed. Theother day, I was outside the garden, consulting with the gentlemen aboutpaintings, and, when they came to hear that we had started a poeticalsociety, they begged of me to let them have the rough copies to read. SoI wrote out several stanzas, and gave them to them to look over, and whodid not praise them with all sincerity? They even copied them and tookthem to have the blocks cut."
"Are you speaking the truth?" T'an Ch'un and Tai-yue eagerly inquired.
"If I'm telling a lie," Pao-yue laughed, "I'm like that cockatoo on thatframe!"
"You verily do foolish things!" Tai-yue and T'an Ch'un exclaimed with onevoice, at these words. "But not to mention that they were doggerellines, had they even been anything like what verses should be, ourwritings shouldn't have been hawked about outside."
"What's there to fear?" Pao-yue smiled. "Hadn't the writings of women ofold been handed outside the limits of the inner chambers, why, therewould, at present, be no one with any idea of their very existence."
While he passed this remark, they saw Ju Hua arrive from Hsi Ch'un'squarters to ask Pao-yue to go over; and Pao-yue eventually took hisdeparture.
Hsiang Ling then pressed (Tai-yue) to give her T'u's poems. "Do choosesome theme," she also asked Tai-yue and T'an Ch'un, "and let me go andwrite on it. When I've done, I'll bring it for you to correct."
"Last night," Tai-yue observed, "the moon was so magnificent, that Imeant to improvise a stanza on it; but as I haven't done yet, go at onceand write one using the fourteenth rhyme, 'han,' (cool). You're atliberty to make use of whatever words you fancy."
Hearing this, Hsiang Ling was simply delighted, and taking the poems,she went back. After considerable exertion, she succeeded in devising acouplet, but so little able was she to tear herself away from the 'T'u'poems, that she perused another couple of stanzas, until she had noinclination for either tea or food, and she felt in an unsettled mood,try though she did to sit or recline.
"Why," Pao-ch'ai remonstrated, "do you bring such trouble upon yourself?It's that P'in Erh, who has led you on to it! But I'll settle accountswith her! You've all along been a thick-headed fool; but now that you'veburdened yourself with all this, you've become a greater fool."
"Miss," smiled Hsiang Ling, "don't confuse me."
So saying, she set to work and put together a stanza, which she firstand foremost handed to Pao-ch'ai to look over.
"This isn't good!" Pao-ch'ai smilingly said. "This isn't the way to doit! Don't fear of losing face, but take it and give it to her to peruse.We'll see what she says."
At this suggestion, Hsiang Ling forthwith went with her verses in searchof Tai-yue. When Tai-yue came to read them, she found their text to be:
  The night grows cool, what time Selene reacheth the mid-heavens.  Her radiance pure shineth around with such a spotless sheen.  Bards oft for inspiration raise on her their thoughts and eyes.  The rustic daren't see her, so fears he to enhance his grief.  Jade mirrors are suspended near the tower of malachite.  An icelike plate dangles outside the gem-laden portiere.  The eve is fine, so why need any silvery candles burn?  A clear light shines with dazzling lustre on the painted rails.
"There's a good deal of spirit in them," Tai-yue smiled, "but thelanguage is not elegant. It's because you've only read a few poeticalworks that you labour under restraint. Now put this stanza aside andwrite another. Pluck up your courage and go and work away."
After listening to her advice, Hsiang Ling quietly wended her way back,but so much the more (preoccupied) was she in her mind that she did noteven enter the house, but remaining under the trees, planted by the sideof the pond, she either seated herself on a rock and plunged in areverie, or squatted down and dug the ground, to the astonishment of allthose, who went backwards and forwards. Li wan, Pao-ch'ai, T'an Ch'un,Pao-yue and some others heard about her; and, taking their position someway off on the mound, they watched her, much amused. At one time, theysaw her pucker up her eyebrows; and at another smile to herself.
"That girl must certainly be cracked!" Pao-ch'ai laughed. "Last nightshe kept on muttering away straight up to the fifth watch, when she atlast turned in. But shortly, daylight broke, and I heard her get up andcomb her hair, all in a hurry, and rush after P'in Erh. In a while,however, she returned; and, after acting like an idiot the whole day,she managed to put together a stanza. But it wasn't after all, good, soshe's, of course, now trying to devise another."
"This indeed shows," Pao-yue laughingly remarked, "that the earth isspiritual, that man is intelligent, and that heaven does not in thecreation of human beings bestow on them natural gifts to no purpose.We've been sighing and lamenting that it was a pity that such a one asshe, should, really, be so unpolished; but who could ever haveanticipated that things would, in the long run, reach the present pass?This is a clear sign that heaven and earth are most equitable!"
"If only," smiled Pao-ch'ai, at these words, "you could be aspainstaking as she is, what a good thing it would be. And would you failto attain success in anything you might take up?"
Pao-yue made no reply. But realising that Hsiang Ling had crossed over inhigh spirits to find Tai-yue again, T'an Ch'un laughed and suggested,"Let's follow her there, and see whether her composition is any good."
At this proposal, they came in a body to the Hsiao Hsiang lodge. Herethey discovered Tai-yue holding the verses and explaining various thingsto her.
"What are they like?" they all thereupon inquired of Tai-yue.
"This is naturally a hard job for her!" Tai-yue rejoined. "They're notyet as good as they should be. This stanza is far too forced; you mustwrite another."
One and all however expressed a desire to look over the verses. Onperusal, they read:
  'Tis not silver, neither water that on the windows shines so cold.  Selene, mark! covers, like a jade platter, the clear vault of heaven.  What time the fragrance faint of the plum bloom is fain to tinge the      air,  The dew-bedecked silken willow trees begin to lose their leaves.  'Tis the remains of powder which methinks besmear the golden steps.  Her lustrous rays enshroud like light hoar-frost the jadelike      balustrade.  When from my dreams I wake, in the west tower, all human trace is      gone.  Her slanting orb can yet clearly be seen across the bamboo screen.
"It doesn't sound like a song on the moon," Pao-ch'ai smilinglyobserved. "Yet were, after the word 'moon', that of 'light' supplied, itwould be better; for, just see, if each of these lines treated of themoonlight, they would be all right. But poetry primarily springs fromnonsensical language. In a few days longer, you'll be able to do well."
Hsiang Ling had flattered herself that this last stanza was perfect, andthe criticisms, that fell on her ear, damped her spirits again. She wasnot however disposed to relax in her endeavours, but felt eager tocommune with her own thoughts, so when she perceived the young ladieschatting and laughing, she betook herself all alone to the bamboo-groveat the foot of the steps; where she racked her brain, and ransacked hermind with such intentness that her ears were deaf to everything aroundher and her eyes blind to everything beyond her task.
"Miss Ling," T'an Ch'un presently cried, smiling from inside the window,"do have a rest!"
"The character 'rest;'" Hsiang Ling nervously replied, "comes from lotN. deg. 15, under 'shan', (to correct); so it's the wrong rhyme."
This rambling talk made them involuntarily burst out laughing.
"In very fact," Pao-sh'ai laughed, "she's under a poetical frenzy, andit's all P'in Erh who has incited her."
"The holy man says," Tai-yue smilingly rejoined, "that 'one must not beweary of exhorting people'; and if she comes, time and again, to ask methis and that how can I possibly not tell her?"
"Let's take her to Miss Quarta's rooms," Li Wan smiled, "and if we couldcoax her to look at the painting, and bring her to her senses, it willbe well."
Speaking the while, she actually walked out of the room, and laying holdof her, she brought her through the Lotus Fragrance arbour to the bankof Warm Fragrance. Hsi Ch'un was tired and languid, and was lying on thewindow, having a midday siesta. The painting was resting against thepartition-wall, and was screened with a gauze cover. With one voice,they roused Hsi Ch'un, and raising the gauze cover to contemplate herwork, they saw that three tenths of it had already been accomplished.But their attention was attracted by the representation of severalbeautiful girls, inserted in the picture, so pointing at Hsiang Ling:"Every one who can write verses is to be put here," they said, "so bequick and learn."
But while conversing, they played and laughed for a time, after which,each went her own way.
Hsiang Ling was meanwhile preoccupied about her verses, so, when eveningcame, she sat facing the lamp absorbed in thought. And the third watchstruck before she got to bed. But her eyes were so wide awake, that itwas only after the fifth watch had come and gone, that she, at length,felt drowsy and fell fast asleep.
Presently, the day dawned, and Pao-ch'ai woke up; but, when she lent anear, she discovered (Hsiang Ling) in a sound sleep. "She has racked herbrains the whole night long," she pondered. "I wonder, however, whethershe has succeeded in finishing her task. She must be tired now, so Iwon't disturb her."
But in the midst of her cogitations, she heard Hsiang Ling laugh andexclaim in her sleep: "I've got it. It cannot be that this stanza toowon't be worth anything."
"How sad and ridiculous!" Pao-ch'ai soliloquised with a smile. And,calling her by name, she woke her up. "What have you got?" she asked."With that firmness of purpose of yours, you could even become a spirit!But before you can learn how to write poetry, you'll be getting someillness."
Chiding her the while, she combed her hair and washed; and, this done,she repaired, along with her cousins, into dowager lady Chia's quarters.
Hsiang Ling made, in fact, such desperate efforts to learn all aboutpoetry that her system got quite out of order. But although she did notin the course of the day hit upon anything, she quite casually succeededin her dreams in devising eight lines; so concluding her toilette andher ablutions, she hastily jotted them down, and betook herself into theHsin Fang pavilion. Here she saw Li Wan and the whole bevy of youngladies, returning from Madame Wang's suite of apartments.
Pao-ch'ai was in the act of telling them of the verses composed byHsiang Ling, while asleep, and of the nonsense she had been talking, andevery one of them was convulsed with laughter. But upon raising theirheads, and perceiving that she was approaching, they vied with eachother in pressing her to let them see her composition.
But, reader, do you wish to know any further particulars? If you do;read those given in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XLIX.
  White snow and red plum blossom in the crystal world.  The pretty girl, fragrant with powder, cuts some meat and eats it.
Hsiang Ling, we will now proceed, perceived the young ladies engaged inchatting and laughing, and went up to them with a smiling countenance."Just you look at this stanza!" she said. "If it's all right, then I'llcontinue my studies; but if it isn't worth any thing, I'll banish atonce from my mind all idea of going in for versification."
With these words, she handed the verses to Tai-yue and her companions.When they came to look at them, they found this to be their burden:
  If thou would'st screen Selene's beauteous sheen, thou'lt find it      hard.  Her shadows are by nature full of grace, frigid her form.  A row of clothes-stones batter, while she lights a thousand li.  When her disc's half, and the cock crows at the fifth watch, 'tis      cold.  Wrapped in my green cloak in autumn, I hear flutes on the stream.  While in the tower the red-sleeved maid leans on the rails at night.  She feels also constrained to ask of the goddess Ch'ang O:  'Why it is that she does not let the moon e'er remain round?'
"This stanza is not only good," they with one voice exclaimed, afterperusing it, "but it's original, it's charming. It bears out theproverb: 'In the world, there's nothing difficult; the only thing hardto get at is a human being with a will.' We'll certainly ask you to joinour club."
Hsiang Ling caught this remark; but so little did she credit it thatfancying that they were making fun of her, she still went on to pressTai-yue, Pao-ch'ai and the other girls to give her their opinions. Butwhile engaged in speaking, she spied a number of young waiting-maids,and old matrons come with hurried step. "Several young ladies and ladieshave come," they announced smilingly, "but we don't know any of them. Soyour ladyship and you, young ladies, had better come at once and seewhat relatives they are."
"What are you driving at?" Li Wan laughed. "You might, after all, statedistinctly whose relatives they are."
"Your ladyship's two young sisters have come," the matrons and maidsrejoined smiling. "There's also another young lady, who says she's missHsueeh's cousin, and a gentleman who pretends to be Mr. Hsueeh P'an'sjunior cousin. We are now off to ask Mrs. Hsueeh to meet them. But yourladyship and the young ladies might go in advance and greet them." Asthey spoke, they straightway took their leave.
"Has our Hsueeh K'o come along with his sisters?" Pao-ch'ai inquired,with a smile.
"My aunt has probably also come to the capital," Li Wan laughed. "How isit they've all arrived together? This is indeed a strange thing!" Thenadjourning in a body into Madame Wang's drawing rooms, they saw thefloor covered with a black mass of people.
Madame Hsing's sister-in-law was there as well. She had entered thecapital with her daughter, Chou Yen, to look up madame Hsing. But ladyFeng's brother, Wang Jen, had, as luck would have it, just beenpreparing to start for the capital, so the two family connexions set outin company for their common destination. After accomplishing half theirjourney, they encountered, while their boats were lying at anchor, LiWan's widowed sister-in-law, who also was on her way to the metropolis,with her two girls, the elder of whom was Li Wen and the younger LiCh'i. They all them talked matters over, and, induced by the ties ofrelationship, the three families prosecuted their voyage together. Butsubsequently, Hsueeh P'an's cousin Hsueeh K'o,--whose father had, when ona visit years ago to the capital, engaged his uterine sister to the sonof the Han-lin Mei, whose residence was in the metropolis,--came whileplanning to go and consummate the marriage, to learn of Wang Jen'sdeparture, so taking his sister with him, he kept in his track till hemanaged to catch him up. Hence it happened that they all now arrived ina body to look up their respective relatives. In due course, theyexchanged the conventional salutations; and these over, they had a chat.
Dowager lady Chia and madame Wang were both filled with ineffabledelight.
"Little wonder is it," smiled old lady Chia, "if the snuff of the lampcrackled time and again; and if it formed and reformed into a head! Itwas, indeed, sure to come to this to-day!"
While she conversed on every-day topics, the presents had to be putaway; and, as she, at the same time, expressed a wish to keep the newarrivals to partake of some wine and eatables, lady Feng had, needlessto say, much extra work added to her ordinary duties.
Li Wan and Pao-ch'ai descanted, of course, with their aunts and cousinson the events that had transpired since their separation. But Tai-yue,though when they first met, continued in cheerful spirits, could notagain, when the recollection afterwards flashed through her mind thatone and all had their relatives, and that she alone had not a soul torely upon, avoid withdrawing out of the way, and giving vent to tears.
Pao-yue, however, read her feelings, and he had to do all that lay in hispower to exhort her and to console her for a time before she cheered up.Pao-yue then hurried into the I Hung court. Going up to Hsi Jen, She Yueehand Chi'ng Wen: "Don't you yet hasten to go and see them?" he smiled."Who'd ever have fancied that cousin Pao-ch'ai's own cousin would bewhat he is? That cousin of hers is so unique in appearance and indeportment. He looks as if he were cousin Pao-ch'ai's uterine youngerbrother. But what's still more odd is, that you should have kept onsaying the whole day long that cousin Pao-ch'ai is a very beautifulcreature. You should now see her cousin, as well as the two girls of hersenior sister-in-law. I couldn't adequately tell you what they're like.Good heavens! Good heavens! What subtle splendour and spiritual beautymust you possess to produce beings like them, so superior to other humancreatures! How plain it is that I'm like a frog wallowing at the bottomof a well! I've throughout every hour of the day said to myself thatnowhere could any girls be found to equal those at present in our home;but, as it happens, I haven't had far to look! Even in our own nativesphere, one would appear to eclipse the other! Here I have now managedto add one more stratum to my store of learning! But can it possibly bethat outside these few, there can be any more like them?"
As he uttered these sentiments, he smiled to himself. But Hsi Jennoticed how much under the influence of his insane fits he once morewas, and she promptly abandoned all idea of going over to pay herrespects to the visitors.
Ch'ing Wen and the other girls had already gone and seen them and comeback. Putting on a smile, "You'd better," they urged Hsi Jen, "be off atonce and have a look at them. Our elder mistress' niece, Miss Pao'scousin, and our senior lady's two sisters resemble a bunch of four leeksso pretty are they!"
But scarcely were these words out of their lips, than they perceivedT'an Ch'un too enter the room, beaming with smiles. She came in quest ofPao-yue.
"Our poetical society is in a flourishing way," she remarked.
"It is," smiled Pao-yue. "Here no sooner do we, in the exuberance of ourspirits, start a poetical society, than the devils and gods bringthrough their agency, all these people in our midst! There's only onething however. Have they, I wonder, ever learnt how to write poetry ornot?"
"I just now asked every one of them," T'an Ch'un replied. "Their ideasof themselves are modest, it's true, yet from all I can gather there'snot one who can't versify. But should there even be any who can't,there's nothing hard about it. Just look at Hsiang Ling. Her case willshow you the truth of what I say."
"Of the whole lot," smiled Ch'ing Wen, "Miss Hsueeh's cousin carries thepalm. What do you think about her, Miss Tertia?"
"It's really so!" T'an Ch'un responded. "In my own estimation, even herelder cousin and all this bevy of girls are not fit to hold a candle toher!"
Hsi Jen felt much surprise at what she heard. "This is indeed odd!" shesmiled. "Whence could one hunt up any better? We'd like to go and have apeep at her."
"Our venerable senior," T'an Ch'un observed, "was at the very firstsight of her so charmed with her that there's nothing she wouldn't do.She has already compelled our Madame Hsing to adopt her as a godchild.Our dear ancestor wishes to bring her up herself; this point was settleda little while back."
Pao-yue went into ecstasies. "Is this a fact?" he eagerly inquired.
"How often have I gone in for yarns?" T'an Ch'un said. "Now that ourworthy senior," continuing, she laughed, "has got this nicegranddaughter, she has banished from her mind all thought of a grandsonlike you!"
"Never mind," answered Pao-yue smiling. "It's only right that girlsshould be more doated upon. But to-morrow is the sixteenth, so we shouldhave a meeting."
"That girl Lin Tai-yue is no sooner out of bed," T'an Ch'un remarked,"than cousin Secunda falls ill again. Everything is, in fact, up anddown!"
"Our cousin Secunda," Pao-yue explained, "doesn't also go in very muchfor verses, so, what would it matter if she were left out?"
"It would be well to wait a few days," T'an Ch'un urged, "until the newcomers have had time to see enough of us to become intimate. We can theninvite them to join us. Won't this be better? Our senior sister-in-lawand cousin Pao have now no mind for poetry. Besides, Hsiang-yuen has notarrived. P'in Erh is just over her sickness. The members are not alltherefore in a fit state, so wouldn't it be preferable if we waiteduntil that girl Yuen came? The new arrivals will also have a chance ofbecoming friendly. P'in Erh will likewise recover entirely. Our seniorsister-in-law and cousin Pao will have time to compose their minds; andHsiang Ling to improve in her verses. We shall then be able to convene afull meeting; and won't it be better? You and I must now go over to ourworthy ancestor's, on the other side, and hear what's up. But, barringcousin Pao-ch'ai's cousin,--for we needn't take her into account, asit's sure to have been decided that she should live in our home,--if theother three are not to stay here with us, we should entreat ourgrandmother to let them as well take up their quarters in the garden.And if we succeed in adding a few more to our number, won't it be morefun for us?"
Pao-yue at these words was so much the more gratified that his veryeyebrows distended, and his eyes laughed. "You've got your wits aboutyou!" he speedily exclaimed. "My mind is ever so dull! I've vainly givenway to a fit of joy. But to think of these contingencies was beyond me!"
So saying the two cousins repaired together to their grandmother's suiteof apartments; where, in point of fact, Madame Wang had already gonethrough the ceremony of recognizing Hsueeh Pao-ch'in as her godchild.Dowager lady Chia's fascination for her, however, was so much out of thecommon run that she did not tell her to take up her quarters in thegarden. Of a night, she therefore slept with old lady Chia in the samerooms; while Hsueeh K'o put up in Hsueeh P'an's study.
"Your niece needn't either return home," dowager lady Chia observed toMadame Hsing. "Let her spend a few days in the garden and see the placebefore she goes."
Madame Hsing's brother and sister-in-law were, indeed, in straitenedcircumstances at home. So much so that they had, on their present visitto the capital, actually to rely upon such accommodation as Madame Hsingcould procure for them and upon such help towards their travellingexpenses as she could afford to give them. When she consequently heardher proposal, Madame Hsing was, of course, only too glad to comply withher wishes, and readily she handed Hsing Chou-yen to the charge of ladyFeng. But lady Feng, bethinking herself of the number of young ladiesalready in the garden, of their divergent dispositions and, above allthings, of the inconvenience of starting a separate household, deemed itadvisable to send her to live along with Ying Ch'un; for in the event,(she thought), of Hsing Chou-yen meeting afterwards with anycontrarieties, she herself would be clear of all responsibility, eventhough Madame Hsing came to hear about them. Deducting, therefore anyperiod, spent by Hsing Chou-yen on a visit home, lady Feng allowed HsingChou-yen as well, if she extended her stay in the garden of Broad Vistafor any time over a month, an amount equal to that allotted to YingCh'un.
Lady Feng weighed with unprejudiced eye Hsing Chou-yen's temperament anddeportment. She found in her not the least resemblance to Madame Hsing,or even to her father and mother; but thought her a most genial andlove-inspiring girl. This consideration actuated lady Feng (not to dealharshly with her), but to pity her instead for the poverty, in whichthey were placed at home, and for the hard lot she had to bear, and totreat her with far more regard than she did any of the other youngladies. Madame Hsing, however, did not lavish much attention on her.
Dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the rest had all along been fond ofLi Wan for her virtuous and benevolent character. Besides, hercontinence in remaining a widow at her tender age commanded generalesteem. When they therefore now saw her husbandless sister-in-law cometo pay her a visit, they would not allow her to go and live outside themansion. Her sister-in-law was, it is true, extremely opposed to theproposal, but as dowager lady Chia was firm in her determination, shehad no other course but to settle down, along with Li Wen and Li Ch'i,in the Tao Hsiang village.
They had by this time assigned quarters to all the new comers, when, whowould have thought it, Shih Ting, Marquis of Chung Ching, was once againappointed to a high office in another province, and he had shortly totake his family and proceed to his post. But so little could old ladyChia brook the separation from Hsiang-yuen that she kept her behind andreceived her in her own home. Her original idea was to have asked ladyFeng to have separate rooms arranged for her, but Shih Hsiang-yuen was soobstinate in her refusal, her sole wish being to put up with Pao-ch'ai,that the idea had, in consequence, to be abandoned.
At this period, the garden of Broad Vista was again much more full oflife than it had ever been before. Li Wan was the chief inmate. The restconsisted of Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un, Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yue,Hsiang-yuen, Li Wen, Li Ch'i, Pao Ch'in and Hsing Chou-yen. In additionto these, there were lady Feng and Pao-yue, so that they musteredthirteen in all. As regards age, irrespective of Li Wan, who was by farthe eldest, and lady Feng, who came next, the other inmates did notexceed fourteen, sixteen or seventeen. But the majority of them had comeinto the world in the same year, though in different months, so theythemselves could not remember distinctly who was senior, and who junior.Even dowager lady Chia, Madame Wang and the matrons and maids in thehousehold were unable to tell the differences between them with anyaccuracy, given as they were to the simple observance of addressingthemselves promiscuously and quite at random by the four wordsrepresenting 'female cousin' and 'male cousin.'
Hsiang Ling was gratifying her wishes to her heart's content anddevoting her mind exclusively to the composition of verses, notpresuming however to make herself too much of a nuisance to Pao-ch'ai,when, by a lucky coincidence, Shih Hsiang-yuen came on the scene. But howwas it possible for one so loquacious as Hsiang-yuen to avoid the subjectof verses, when Hsiang Ling repeatedly begged her for explanations? Thisinspirited her so much the more, that not a day went by, yea not asingle night, on which she did not start some loud argument and lengthydiscussion.
"You really," Pao-ch'ai felt impelled to laugh, "kick up such a din,that it's quite unbearable! Fancy a girl doing nothing else than turningpoetry into a legitimate thing for raising an argument! Why, were someliterary persons to hear you, they would, instead of praising you, havea laugh at your expense, and say that you don't mind your own business.We hadn't yet got rid of Hsiang Ling with all her rubbish, and here wehave a chatterbox like you thrown on us! But what is it that that mouthof yours keeps on jabbering? What about the bathos of Tu Kung-pu; andthe unadorned refinement of Wei Su-chou? What also about Wen Pa-ch'a'selegant diction; and Li I-shan's abstruseness? A pack of silly foolsthat you are! Do you in any way behave like girls should?"
These sneers evoked laughter from both Hsiang Ling and Hsiang-yuen. Butin the course of their conversation, they perceived Pao-ch'in drop in,with a waterproof wrapper thrown over her, so dazzling with its gold andpurplish colours, that they were at a loss to make out what sort ofarticle it could be.
"Where did you get this?" Pao-ch'ai eagerly inquired.
"It was snowing," Pao-ch'in smilingly replied, "so her venerableladyship turned up this piece of clothing and gave it to me."
Hsiang Ling drew near and passed it under inspection. "No wonder," sheexclaimed, "it looks so handsome! It's verily woven with peacock'sfeathers."
"What about peacock's feathers?" Hsiang-yuen laughed. "It's made of thefeathers plucked from the heads of wild ducks. This is a clear sign thatour worthy ancestor is fond of you, for with all her love for Pao-yue,she hasn't given it to him to wear."
"Truly does the proverb say: 'that every human being has his respectivelot.'" Pao-ch'ai smiled. "Nothing ever was further from my thoughts thanthat she would, at this juncture, drop on the scene! Come she may, buthere she also gets our dear ancestor to lavish such love on her!"
"Unless you stay with our worthy senior," Hsiang-yuen said, "do come intothe garden. You may romp and laugh and eat and drink as much as you likein these two places. But when you get over to Madame Hsing's rooms, talkand joke with her, if she be at home, to your heart's content; it won'tmatter if you tarry ever so long. But should she not be in, don't putyour foot inside; for the inmates are many in those rooms and theirhearts are evil. All they're up to is to do us harm."
These words much amused Pao-ch'ai, Pao-ch'in, Hsiang-Ling, Ying Erh andthe others present.
"Were one to say," Pao-ch'ai smiled, "that you're heartless, (itwouldn't do); for you've got a heart. But despite your having a heart,your tongue is, in fact, a little too outspoken! You should reallyto-day acknowledge this Ch'in Erh of ours as your own sister!"
"This article of clothing," Hsiang-yuen laughed, casting another glanceat Pao-ch'in, "is only meet for her to wear. It wouldn't verily lookwell on any one else."
Saying this, she espied Hu Po enter the room. "Our old mistress," sheput in smiling, "bade me tell you, Miss Pao-ch'ai, not to keep toostrict a check over Miss Ch'in, for she's yet young; that you should lether do as she pleases, and that whatever she wants you should ask for,and not be afraid."
Pao-ch'ai hastily jumped to her feet and signified her obedience.Pushing Pao-ch'in, she laughed. "Even you couldn't tell whence thispiece of good fortune hails from," she said. "Be off now; for mind, wemight hurt your feelings. I can never believe myself so inferior toyou!"
As she spoke, Pao-yue and Tai-yue walked in. But as Pao-ch'ai continued toindulge in raillery to herself, "Cousin Pao," Hsiang-yuen smilinglyremonstrated, "you may, it's true, be jesting, but what if there wereany one to entertain such ideas in real earnest?"
"If any one took things in earnest," Hu Po interposed laughing, "why,she'd give offence to no one else but to him." Pointing, as she utteredthis remark, at Pao-yue.
"He's not that sort of person!" Pao-ch'ai and Hsiang-yuen simultaneouslyventured, with a significant smile.
"If it isn't he," Hu Po proceeded still laughing, "it's she." Turningagain her finger towards Tai-yue.
Hsiang-yuen expressed not a word by way of rejoinder.
"That's still less likely," Pao-ch'ai smiled, "for my cousin is like herown sister; and she's far fonder of her than of me. How could shetherefore take offence? Do you credit that nonsensical trash uttered byYuen-erh! Why what good ever comes out of that mouth of hers?"
Pao-yue was ever well aware that Tai-yue was gifted with a somewhat meandisposition. He had not however as yet come to learn anything of whathad recently transpired between Tai-yue and Pao-ch'ai. He was thereforejust giving way to fears lest his grandmother's fondness for Pao-ch'inshould be the cause of her feeling dejected. But when he now heard theremarks passed by Hsiang-yuen, and the rejoinders made, on the otherhand, by Pao-ch'ai, and, when he noticed how different Tai-yue's voiceand manner were from former occasions, and how they actually bore outPao-ch'ai's insinuation, he was at a great loss how to solve themystery. "These two," he consequently pondered, "were never like thisbefore! From all I can now see, they're, really, a hundred times farmore friendly than any others are!" But presently he also observed LinTai-yue rush after Pao-ch'in, and call out 'Sister,' and, without evenmaking any allusion to her name or any mention to her surname, treat herin every respect, just as if she were her own sister.
This Pao-ch'in was young and warm-hearted. She was naturally besides ofan intelligent disposition. She had, from her very youth up, learnt howto read and how to write. After a stay, on the present occasion, of acouple of days in the Chia mansion, she became acquainted with nearlyevery inmate. And as she saw that the whole bevy of young ladies werenot of a haughty nature, and that they kept on friendly terms with herown cousin, she did not feel disposed to treat them with anydiscourtesy. But she had likewise found out for herself that Lin Tai-yuewas the best among the whole lot, so she started with Tai-yue, more thanwith any one else, a friendship of unusual fervour. This did not escapePao-yue's notice; but all he could do was to secretly give way toamazement.
Shortly, however, Pao-ch'ai and her cousin repaired to Mrs. Hsueeh'squarters. Hsiang-yuen then betook herself to dowager lady Chia'sapartments, while Lin Tai-yue returned to her room and lay down to rest.
Pao-yue thereupon came to look up Tai-yue.
"Albeit I've read the 'Record of the Western Side-room,'" he smiled,"and understood a few passages of it, yet when I quoted some in order tomake you laugh, you flew into a huff! But I now remember that there is,indeed, a passage, which is not intelligible to me; so let me quote itfor you to explain it for me!"
Hearing this, Tai-yue immediately concluded that his words harboured somesecret meaning, so putting on a smile, "Recite it and let me hear it,"she said.
"In the 'Confusion' chapter," Pao-yue laughingly began, "there's a linecouched in most beautiful language. It's this: 'What time did Meng Kuangreceive Liang Hung's candlestick?' (When did you and Pao-ch'ai get to besuch friends?) These five characters simply bear on a stock story; butto the credit of the writer be it, the question contained in the threeempty words representing, 'What time' is set so charmingly! When did shereceive it? Do tell me!"
At this inquiry, Tai-yue too could not help laughing. "The question wasoriginally nicely put," she felt urged to rejoin with a laugh. "Butthough the writer sets it gracefully, you ask it likewise with equalgrace!"
"At one time," Pao-yue. observed, "all you knew was to suspect that I(was in love with Pao-ch'ai); and have you now no faults to find?"
"Who ever could have imagined her such a really nice girl!" Tai-yuesmiled. "I've all along thought her full of guile!" And seizing theoccasion, she told Pao-yue with full particulars how she had, in the gameof forfeits, made an improper quotation, and what advice Pao-ch'ai hadgiven her on the subject; how she had even sent her some birds' nests,and what they had said in the course of the chat they had had during herillness.
Pao-yue then at length came to see why it was that such a warm friendshiphad sprung up between them. "To tell you the truth," he consequentlyremarked smilingly, "I was just wondering when Meng Kuang had receivedLiang Hung's candlestick; and, lo, you, indeed, got it, when a merechild and through some reckless talk, (and your friendship was sealed)."
As the conversation again turned on Pao-ch'in, Tai-yue recalled to mindthat she had no sister, and she could not help melting once more intotears.
Pao-yue hastened to reason with her. "This is again bringing trouble uponyourself!" he argued. "Just see how much thinner you are this year thanyou were last; and don't you yet look after your health? Youdeliberately worry yourself every day of your life. And when you've hada good cry, you feel at last that you've acquitted yourself of theduties of the day."
"Of late," Tai-yue observed, drying her tears, "I feel sore at heart. Butmy tears are scantier by far than they were in years gone by. With allthe grief and anguish, which gnaw my heart, my tears won't fallplentifully."
"This is because weeping has become a habit with you," Pao-yue added."But though you fancy to yourself that it is so, how can your tears havebecome scantier than they were?"
While arguing with her, he perceived a young waiting-maid, attached tohis room, bring him a red felt wrapper. "Our senior mistress, lady ChiaChu," she went on, "has just sent a servant to say that, as it snows,arrangements should be made for inviting people to-morrow to writeverses."
But hardly was this message delivered, than they saw Li Wan's maidenter, and invite Tai-yue to go over. Pao-yue then proposed to Tai-yue toaccompany him, and together they came to the Tao Hsiang village. Tai-yuechanged her shoes for a pair of low shoes made of red scented sheepskin, ornamented with gold, and hollowed clouds. She put on a deep redcrape cloak, lined with white fox fur; girdled herself with alapis-lazuli coloured sash, decorated with bright green double rings andfour sceptres; and covered her head with a hat suitable for rainyweather. After which, the two cousins trudged in the snow, and repairedto this side of the mansion. Here they discovered the young ladiesassembled, dressed all alike in deep red felt or camlet capes, with theexception of Li Wan, who was clad in a woollen jacket, buttoning in themiddle.
Hsueeh Pao-ch'ai wore a pinkish-purple twilled pelisse, lined withforeign 'pa' fur, worked with threads from abroad, and ornamented withdouble embroidery. Hsing Chou-yen was still attired in an old costume,she ordinarily used at home, without any garment for protection againstthe rain. Shortly, Shih Hsiang-yuen arrived. She wore the long pelisse,given her by dowager lady Chia, which gave warmth both from the insideand outside, as the top consisted of martin-head fur, and the lining ofthe long-haired coat of the dark grey squirrel. On her head, she had adeep red woollen hood, made _a la_ Chao Chuen, with designs ofclouds scooped out on it. This was lined with gosling-yellow,gold-streaked silk. Round her neck, she had a collar of sable fur.
"Just see here!" Tai-yue was the first to shout with a laugh. "Here comesSun Hsing-che the 'monkey-walker!' Lo, like him, she holds a snow cloak,and purposely puts on the air of a young bewitching ape!"
"Look here, all of you!" Hsiang-yuen laughed. "See what I wear inside!"
So saying, she threw off her cloak. This enabled them to notice that shewore underneath a half-new garment with three different coloured borderson the collar and cuffs, consisting of a short pelisse of russetmaterial lined with ermine and ornamented with dragons embroidered invariegated silks whose coils were worked with golden threads. The lapelwas narrow. The sleeves were short. The folds buttoned on the side.Under this, she had a very short light-red brocaded satin bodkin, linedwith fur from foxes' ribs. Round her waist was lightly attached amany-hued palace sash, with butterfly knots and long tassels. On herfeet, she too wore a pair of low shoes made of deer leather. Her waistlooked more than ever like that of a wasp, her back like that of thegibbon. Her bearing resembled that of a crane, her figure that of amantis.
"Her weak point," they laughed unanimously, "is to get herself up tolook like a young masher. But she does, there's no denying, cut a muchhandsomer figure like this, than when she's dressed up like a girl!"
"Lose no time," Hsiang-yuen smiled, "in deliberating about writingverses, for I'd like to hear who is to stand treat."
"According to my idea," Li Wan chimed in, "I think that as thelegitimate day, which was yesterday, has gone by, it would be too longto wait for another proper date. As luck would have it, it's snowingagain to-day, so won't it be well to raise contributions among ourselvesand have a meeting? We'll thus be able to give the visitors a greeting;and to get an opportunity of writing a few verses. But what are yourviews on the subject?"
"This proposal is excellent!" Pao-yue was the first to exclaim. "The onlything is that it's too late to-day; and if it clears up by to-morrow,there will be really no fun."
"It isn't likely," cried out the party with one voice, "that this snowyweather will clear up. But even supposing it does, the snow which willfall during this night will be sufficient for our enjoyment."
"This place of mine is nice enough, it's true," Li Wan added, "yet itisn't up to the Lu Hsueeh Pavilion. I've already therefore despatchedworkmen to raise earthen couches, so that we should all be able to sitround the fire and compose our verses. Our venerable senior, I fancy, isnot sure about caring to join us. Besides, this is only a smallamusement between ourselves so if we just let that hussy Feng knowsomething about it, it will be quite enough. A tael from each of youwill be ample, but send your money to me here! As regards Hsiang Ling,Pao-ch'in, Li Wen, Li Ch'i and Chou-yen, the five of them, we needn'tcount them. Neither need we include the two girls of our number, who areill; nor take into account the four girls who've asked for leave. If youwill let me have your four shares, I'll undertake to see that five orsix taels be made to suffice."
Pao-ch'ai and the others without exception signified their acquiescence.They consequently proceeded to propose the themes and to fix upon therhymes.
"I've long ago," smiled Li Wan, "settled them in my own mind, sotomorrow at the proper time you'll really know all about them."
At the conclusion of this remark, they indulged in another chat onirrelevant topics; and this over, they came into old lady Chia'squarters.
Nothing of any note transpired during the course of that day. At anearly hour on the morrow, Pao-yue--for he had been looking forward withsuch keen expectation to the coming event that he had found itimpossible to have any sleep during the night,--jumped out of bed withthe first blush of dawn. Upon raising his curtain and looking out, heobserved that, albeit the doors and windows were as yet closed, a brightlight shone on the lattice sufficient to dazzle the eyes, and his mindbegan at once to entertain misgivings, and to feel regrets, in theassurance that the weather had turned out fine, and that the sun hadalready risen. In a hurry, he simultaneously sprung to his feet, andflung the window-frame open, then casting a glance outside, from withinthe glass casement, he realised that it was not the reflection of thesun, but that of the snow, which had fallen throughout the night to thedepth of over a foot, and that the heavens were still covered as if withtwisted cotton and unravelled floss. Pao-yue got, by this time, into anunusual state of exhilaration. Hastily calling up the servants, andcompleting his ablutions, he robed himself in an egg-plant-colouredcamlet, fox-fur lined pelisse; donned a short-sleeved falconry surtoutornamented with water dragons; tied a sash round his waist; threw overhis shoulders a fine bamboo waterproof; covered his head with a goldenrattan rain-hat; put on a pair of 'sha t'ang' wood clogs, and rushed outwith precipitate step towards the direction of the Lu Hsueeh Pavilion.
As soon as he sallied out of the gate of the courtyard, he gazed on allfour quarters. No trace whatever of any other colour (but white) struckhis eye. In the distance stood the green fir-trees and thekingfisherlike bamboos. They too looked, however, as if they were placedin a glass bowl.
Forthwith he wended his way down the slope and trudged along the foot ofthe hill. But the moment he turned the bend, he felt a whiff of coldfragrance come wafted into his nostrils. Turning his head, he espied tenand more red plum trees, over at Miao Yue's in the Lung Ts'ui monastery.They were red like very rouge. And, reflecting the white colour of thesnow, they showed off their beauty to such an extraordinary degree as topresent a most pleasing sight.
Pao-yue quickly stood still, and gazed, with all intentness, at thelandscape for a time. But just as he was proceeding on his way, hecaught sight of some one on the "Wasp waist" wooden bridge, advancing inhis direction, with an umbrella in hand. It was the servant, despatchedby Li Wan, to request lady Peng to go over.
On his arrival in the Lu Hsueeh pavilion, Pao-yue found the maids andmatrons engaged in sweeping away the snow and opening a passage. This LuHsueeh (Water-rush snow) pavilion was, we might explain, situated on aside hill, in the vicinity of a stream and spanned the rapids formed byit. The whole place consisted of several thatched roofs, mud walls, sidefences, bamboo lattice windows and pushing windows, out of whichfishing-lines could be conveniently dropped. On all four sidesflourished one mass of reeds, which concealed the single path out of thepavilion. Turning and twisting, he penetrated on his way through thegrowth of reeds until he reached the spot where stretched the bamboobridge leading to the Lotus Fragrance Arbour.
The moment the maids and matrons saw him approach with hiswaterproof-wrapper thrown over his person and his rain-hat on his head,they with one voice laughed, "We were just remarking that what waslacking was a fisherman, and lo, now we've got everything that waswanted! The young ladies are coming after their breakfast; you're in tooimpatient a mood!"
At these words, Pao-yue had no help but to retrace his footsteps. As soonas he reached the Hsin Tang pavilion, he perceived T'an Ch'un, issuingfrom the Ch'iu Shuang Study, wrapped in a deep red woollen waterproof,and a 'Kuan Yin' hood on her head, supporting herself on the arm of ayoung maid. Behind her, followed a married woman, holding a glazedumbrella made of green satin.
Pao-yue knew very well that she was on her way to his grandmother's, sospeedily halting by the side of the pavilion, he waited for her to comeup. The two cousins then left the garden together, and betook themselvesto the front part of the mansion. Pao-ch'in was at the time in the innerapartments, combing her hair, washing her hands and face and changingher apparel. Shortly, the whole number of girls arrived. "I feelpeckish!" Pao-yue shouted; and again and again he tried to hurry themeal. It was with great impatience that he waited until the eatablescould be laid on the table.
One of the dishes consisted of kid, boiled in cow's milk. "This ismedicine for us, who are advanced in years," old lady Chia observed."They're things that haven't seen the light! The pity is that you youngpeople can't have any. There's some fresh venison to-day as an extracourse, so you'd better wait and eat some of that!"
One and all expressed their readiness to wait. Pao-yue however could notdelay having something to eat. Seizing a cup of tea, he soaked a bowlfulof rice, to which he added some meat from a pheasant's leg, and gobbledit down in a scramble.
"I'm well aware," dowager lady Chia said, "that as you're up tosomething again to-day, you people have no mind even for your meal. Letthem keep," she therefore cried, "that venison for their eveningrepast!"
"What an idea!" lady Feng promptly put in. "We'll have enough with whatremains of it."
Shih Hsiang-yuen thereupon consulted with Pao-yue. "As there's freshvenison," she said, "wouldn't it be nice to ask for a haunch and take itinto the garden and prepare it ourselves? We'll thus be able to sate ourhunger, and have some fun as well."
At this proposal, Pao-yue actually asked lady Feng to let them have ahaunch, and he bade a matron carry it into the garden.
Presently, they all got up from table. After a time, they entered thegarden and came in a body to the Lu Hsueeh pavilion to hear Li Wan giveout the themes, and fix upon the rhymes. But Hsiang-yuen and Pao-yue werethe only two of whom nothing was seen.
"Those two," Tai-yue observed, "can't get together! The moment they meet,how much trouble doesn't arise! They must surely have now gone to hatchtheir plans over that haunch of venison."
These words were still on her lips when she saw 'sister-in-law' Licoming also to see what the noise was all about. "How is it," she theninquired of Li Wan, "that that young fellow, with the jade, and thatgirl, with the golden unicorn round her neck, both of whom are socleanly and tidy, and have besides ample to eat, are over thereconferring about eating raw meat? There they are chatting, saying thisand saying that; but I can't see how meat can be eaten raw!"
This remark much amused the party. "How dreadful!" they exclaimed, "Bequick and bring them both here!"
"All this fuss," Tay-yue smiled, "is the work of that girl Yuen. I'm notfar off again in my surmises."
Li Wan went out with precipitate step in search of the cousins. "If youtwo are bent upon eating raw meat," she cried, "I'll send you over toour old senior's; you can do so there. What will I care then if you havea whole deer raw and make yourselves ill over it? It won't be anybusiness of mine. But it's snowing hard and it's bitterly cold, so bequick and go and write some verses for me and be off!"
"We're doing nothing of the kind," Pao-yue hastily rejoined. "We're goingto eat some roasted meat."
"Well, that won't matter!" Li Wan observed. And seeing the old matronsbring an iron stove, prongs and a gridiron of iron wire, "Mind you don'tcut your hands," Li Wan resumed, "for we won't have any crying!"
This remark concluded, she walked in.
Lady Feng had sent P'ing Erh from her quarters to announce that she wasunable to come, as the issue of the customary annual money gave her justat present, plenty to keep her busy.
Hsiang-yuen caught sight of P'ing Erh and would not let her go on hererrand. But P'ing Erh too was fond of amusement, and had ever followedlady Feng everywhere she went, so, when she perceived what fun was to begot, and how merrily they joked and laughed, she felt impelled to takeoff her bracelets (and to join them). The trio then pressed round thefire; and P'ing Erh wanted to be the first to roast three pieces ofvenison to regale themselves with.
On the other side, Pao-ch'ai and Tai-yue had, even in ordinary times,seen enough of occasions like the present. They did not therefore thinkit anything out of the way; but Pao-ch'in and the other visitors,inclusive of 'sister-in-law' Li, were filled with intense wonder.
T'an Ch'un had, with the help of Li Wan, and her companions, succeededby this time in choosing the subjects and rhymes. "Just smell that sweetfragrance," T'an Ch'un remarked. "One can smell it even here! I'm alsogoing to taste some."
So speaking, she too went to look them up. But Li Wan likewise followedher out. "The guests are all assembled," she observed. "Haven't youpeople had enough as yet?"
While Hsiang-yuen munched what she had in her month, she replied to herquestion. "Whenever," she said, "I eat this sort of thing, I feel acraving for wine. It's only after I've had some that I shall be able torhyme. Were it not for this venison, I would to-day have positively beenquite unfit for any poetry." As she spoke, she discerned Pao-ch'in,standing and laughing opposite to her, in her duck-down garment.
"You idiot," Hsiang-yuen laughingly cried, "come and have a mouthful totaste."
"It's too filthy!" Pao-ch'in replied smiling.
"You go and try it." Pao-ch'ai added with a laugh. "It's capital! Yourcousin Lin is so very weak that she couldn't digest it, if she had any.Otherwise she too is very fond of this."
Upon hearing this, Pao-ch'in readily crossed over and put a piece in hermouth; and so good did she find it that she likewise started eating someof it.
In a little time, however, lady Feng sent a young maid to call P'ingErh.
"Miss Shih," P'ing Erh explained, "won't let me go. So just return aheadof me."
The maid thereupon took her leave; but shortly after they saw lady Fengarrive; she too with a wrapper over her shoulders.
"You're having," she smiled; "such dainties to eat, and don't you tellme?"
Saying this, she also drew near and began to eat.
"Where has this crowd of beggars turned up from?" Tai-yue put in with alaugh. "But never mind, never mind! Here's the Lu Hsueeh pavilion come infor this calamity to-day, and, as it happens, it's that chit Yuen by whomit has been polluted! But I'll have a good cry for the Lu Hsueehpavilion."
Hsiang-yuen gave an ironical smile. "What do you know?" she exclaimed. "Agenuine man of letters is naturally refined. But as for the whole lot ofyou, your poor and lofty notions are all a sham! You are most loathsome!We may now be frowzy and smelly, as we munch away lustily with ourvoracious appetites, but by and bye we'll prove as refined as scholars,as if we had cultured minds and polished tongues."
"If by and bye," Pao-ch'ai laughingly interposed, "the verses youcompose are not worth anything, I'll tug out that meat you've eaten, andtake some of these snow-buried weeds and stuff you up with. I'll thusput an end to this evil fortune!"
While bandying words, they finished eating. For a time, they busiedthemselves with washing their hands. But when P'ing Erh came to put onher bracelets, she found one missing. She looked in a confused manner,at one time to the left, at another to the right; now in front of her,and then behind her for ever so long, but not a single vestige of it wasvisible. One and all were therefore filled with utter astonishment.
"I know where this bracelet has gone to;" lady Feng suggested smilingly."But just you all go and attend to your poetry. We too can well dispensewith searching for it, and repair to the front. Before three days areout, I'll wager that it turns up. What verses are you writing to-day?"continuing she went on to inquire. "Our worthy senior says that the endof the year is again nigh at hand, and that in the first moon some moreconundrums will have to be devised to be affixed on lanterns, for therecreation of the whole family."
"Of course we'll have to write a few," they laughingly rejoined, uponhearing her remarks. "We forgot all about it. Let's hurry up now, andcompose a few fine ones, so as to have them ready to enjoy some good funin the first moon."
Speaking the while, they came in a body into the room with the earthencouches, where they found the cups, dishes and eatables already laid outin readiness. On the walls had been put up the themes, metre, andspecimen verses. Pao-yue and Hsiang-yuen hastened to examine what waswritten. They saw that they had to take for a theme something on thepresent scenery and indite a stanza with antithetical pentameter lines;that the word 'hsiao,' second (in the book of metre), had been fixedupon as a rhyme; but that there was, below that, no mention, as yet,made of any precedence.
"I can't write verses very well," Li Wan pleaded, "so all I'll do willbe to devise three lines, and the one, who'll finish the task first,we'll have afterwards to pair them."
"We should, after all," Pao-ch'ai urged, "make some distinction withregard to order."
But, reader, if you entertain any desire to know the sequel, peruse theparticulars recorded in the chapter that follows.

CHAPTER L.
  In the Lu Hsueeh pavilion, they vie with each other in pairing verses      on the scenery.  In the Nuan Hsiang village, they compose, in beautiful style, riddles      for the spring lanterns.
But to continue. "We should, after all," Pao-ch'ai suggested, "make somedistinction as to order. Let me write out what's needful."
After uttering this proposal, she urged every one to draw lots anddetermine the precedence. The first one to draw was Li Wan. After her, alist of the respective names was made in the order in which they cameout.
"Well, in that case," lady Feng rejoined, "I'll also give a top line."
The whole party laughed in chorus. "It will be ever so much better likethis," they said.
Pao-ch'ai supplied above 'the old labourer of Tao Hsiang' the word'Feng,' whereupon Li Wan went on to explain the theme to her.
"You musn't poke fun at me!" lady Feng smiled, after considerablereflection. "I've only managed to get a coarse line. It consists of fivewords. As for the rest, I have no idea how to manage them."
"The coarser the language, the better it is," one and all laughed. "Outwith it! You can then go and attend to your legitimate business!"
"I fancy," lady Feng observed, "that when it snows there's bound to benortherly wind, for last night I heard the wind blow from the north thewhole night long. I've got a line, it's:
 "'The whole night long the northern wind was high;'
"but whether it will do or not, I am not going to worry my mind aboutit."
One and all, upon hearing this, exchanged looks. "This line is, it'strue, coarse," they smiled, "and gives no insight into what comes below,but it's just the kind of opening that would be used by such asunderstand versification. It's not only good, but it will afford tothose, who come after you, inexhaustible scope for writing. In fact,this line will take the lead, so 'old labourer of Tao Hsiang' be quickand indite some more to tag on below."
Lady Feng, 'sister-in-law' Li, and P'ing Erh had then another couple ofglasses, after which each went her own way. During this while Li Wanwrote down:
  The whole night long the northern wind was high;
and then she herself subjoined the antithetical couplet:
  The door I ope, and lo the flakes of snow are still toss'd by the      wind,  And drop into the slush. Oh, what a pity they're so purely white!
Hsiang Ling recited:
  All o'er the ground is spread, alas, this bright, refulgent gem;  But with an aim; for it is meant dry herbage to revive.
T'an Ch'un said:
  Without design the dying sprouts of grain it nutrifies.  But in the villages the price of mellow wine doth rise.
Li Ch'i added:
  In a good year, grain in the house is plentiful.  The bulrush moves and the ash issues from the tube.
Li Wen continued:
  What time spring comes the handle of the Dipper turns.  The bleaky hills have long ago their verdure lost.
Chou-yen proceeded:
  On a frost-covered stream, no tide can ever rise.  Easy the snow hangs on the sparse-leaved willow twigs.
Hsiang-yuen pursued:
  Hard 'tis for snow to pile on broken plantain leaves.  The coal, musk-scented, burns in the precious tripod.
Pao-ch'in recited:
  Th' embroidered sleeve enwraps the golden sable in its folds.  The snow transcends the mirror by the window in lustre.
Pao-yue suggested:
  The fragrant pepper clings unto the wall.  The side wind still in whistling gusts doth blow.
Tai-yue added:
  A quiet dream becomes a cheerless thing.  Where is the fife with plum bloom painted on?
Pao-ch'ai continued:
  In whose household is there a flute made of green jade?  The fish fears lest the earth from its axis might drop.
"I'll go and see that the wine is warm for you people," Li Wan smiled.
But when Pao-ch'ai told Pao-ch'in to connect some lines, she caughtsight of Hsiang-yuen rise to her feet and put in:
  What time the dragon wages war, the clouds dispel.  Back to the wild shore turns the man with single scull.
Pao-ch'in thereupon again appended the couplet:
  The old man hums his lines, and with his whip he points at the 'Pa'      bridge.  Fur coats are, out of pity, on the troops at the frontiers bestowed.
But would Hsiang-yuen allow any one to have a say? The others could notbesides come up to her in quickness of wits so that, while their eyeswere fixed on her, she with eyebrows uplifted and figure outstretchedproceeded to say:
  More cotton coats confer, for bear in memory th' imperial serfs!  The rugged barbarous lands are (on account of snow) with dangers      fraught.
Pao-ch'ai praised the verses again and again, and next contributed thedistich:
  The twigs and branches live in fear of being tossed about.  With what whiteness and feath'ry step the flakes of snow descend!
Tai-yue eagerly subjoined the lines:
  The snow as nimbly falls as moves the waist of the 'Sui' man when      brandishing the sword.  The tender leaves of tea, so acrid to the taste, have just been newly      brewed and tried.
As she recited this couplet, she gave Pao-yue a shove and urged him to goon. Pao-yue was, at the moment, enjoying the intense pleasure of watchingthe three girls Pao-ch'ai, Pao-ch'in and Tai-yue make a joint onslaughton Hsiang-yuen, so that he had of course not given his mind to taggingany antithetical verses. But when he now felt Tai-yue push him he atlength chimed in with:
  The fir is the sole tree which is decreed for ever to subsist.  The wild goose follows in the mud the prints and traces of its steps.
Pao-ch'in took up the clue, adding:
  In the forest, the axe of the woodcutter may betimes be heard.  With (snow) covered contours, a thousand peaks their heads jut in the      air.
Hsiang-yuen with alacrity annexed the verses:
  The whole way tortuous winds like a coiled snake.  The flowers have felt the cold and ceased to bud.
Pao-ch'ai and her companions again with one voice eulogised their finediction.
T'an Ch'un then continued:
  Could e'er the beauteous snow dread the nipping of frost?  In the deep court the shivering birds are startled by its fall.
Hsiang-yuen happened to be feeling thirsty and was hurriedly swallowing acup of tea, when her turn was at once snatched by Chou-yen, who gave outthe lines,
  On the bare mountain wails the old man Hsiao.  The snow covers the steps, both high and low.
Hsiang-yuen immediately put away the tea-cup and added:
  On the pond's surface, it allows itself to float.  At the first blush of dawn with effulgence it shines.
Tai-yue recited with alacrity the couplet:
  In confused flakes, it ceaseless falls the whole night long.  Troth one forgets that it implies three feet of cold.
Hsiang-yuen hastened to smilingly interpose with the distich:
  Its auspicious descent dispels the Emperor's grief.  There lies one frozen-stiff, but who asks him a word?
Pao-ch'in too speedily put on a smile and added:  Glad is the proud wayfarer when he's pressed to drink.  Snapped is the weaving belt in the heavenly machine.
Hsiang-yuen once again eagerly quoted the line:
  In the seaside market is lost a silk kerchief.
But Lin Tai-yue would not let her continue, and taking up the thread, sheforthwith said:
  With quiet silence, it enshrouds the raised kiosque.
Hsiang-yuen vehemently gave the antithetical verse:
  The utter poor clings to his pannier and his bowl.
Pao-ch'in too would not give in as a favour to any one, so hastily sheexclaimed:
  The water meant to brew the tea with gently bubbles up.
Hsiang-yuen saw how excited they were getting and she thought itnaturally great fun. Laughing, she eagerly gave out:
  When wine is boiled with leaves 'tis not easy to burn.
Tai-yue also smiled while suggesting:
  The broom, with which the bonze sweepeth the hill, is sunk in snow.
Pao-ch'in too smilingly cried:
  The young lad takes away the lute interred in snow.
Hsiang-yuen laughed to such a degree that she was bent in two; and shemuttered a line with such rapidity that one and all inquired of her:"What are you, after all, saying?"
  In the stone tower leisurely sleeps the stork.
Hsiang-yuen repeated.
Tai-yue clasped her breast so convulsed was she with laughter. With loudvoice she bawled out:
  Th' embroidered carpet warms the affectionate cat.
Pao-ch'in quickly, again laughingly, exclaimed:
  Inside Selene's cave lo, roll the silvery waves.
Hsiang-yuen added, with eager haste:
  Within the city walls at eve was hid a purple flag.
Tai-yue with alacrity continued with a smile:
  The fragrance sweet, which penetrates into the plums, is good to eat.
Pao-ch'ai smiled. "What a fine line!" she ejaculated; after which, shehastened to complete the couplet by saying:
  The drops from the bamboo are meet, when one is drunk, to mix with      wine.
Pao-ch'in likewise made haste to add:
  Betimes, the hymeneal girdle it moistens.
Hsiang-yuen eagerly paired it with:
  Oft, it freezeth on the kingfisher shoes.
Tai-yue once more exclaimed with vehemence:
  No wind doth blow, but yet there is a rush.
Pao-ch'in promptly also smiled, and strung on:
  No rain lo falls, but still a patter's heard.
Hsiang-yuen was leaning over, indulging in such merriment that she wasquite doubled up in two. But everybody else had realised that the triowas struggling for mastery, so without attempting to versify they kepttheir gaze fixed on them and gave way to laughter.
Tai-yue gave her another push to try and induce her to go on. "Do youalso sometimes come to your wits' ends; and run to the end of yourtether?" she went on to say. "I'd like to see what other stuff andnonsense you can come out with!"
Hsiang-yuen however simply fell forward on Pao-ch'ai's lap and laughedincessantly.
"If you've got any gumption about you," Pao-ch'ai exclaimed, shoving herup, "take the second rhymes under 'Hsiao' and exhaust them all, and I'llthen bend the knee to you."
"It isn't as if I were writing verses," Hsiang-yuen laughed rising to herfeet; "it's really as if I were fighting for very life."
"It's for you to come out with something," they all cried with a laugh.
T'an Ch'un had long ago determined in her mind that there could be noother antithetical sentences that she herself could possibly propose,and she forthwith set to work to copy out the verses. But as she passedthe remark: "They haven't as yet been brought to a proper close," Li Wentook up the clue, as soon as she caught her words, and added thesentiment:
  My wish is to record this morning's fun.
Li Ch'i then suggested as a finale the line:
  By these verses, I'd fain sing th' Emperor's praise.
"That's enough, that will do!" Li Wan cried. "The rhymes haven't, Iadmit, been exhausted, but any outside words you might introduce, will,if used in a forced sense, be worth nothing at all."
While continuing their arguments, the various inmates drew near and keptup a searching criticism for a time.
Hsiang-yuen was found to be the one among them, who had devised thelargest number of lines.
"This is mainly due," they unanimously laughed, "to the virtue of thatpiece of venison!"
"Let's review them line by line as they come," Li Wan smilinglyproposed, "but yet as if they formed one continuous poem. Here's Pao-yuelast again!"
"I haven't, the fact is, the knack of pairing sentences," Pao-yuerejoined with a smile. "You'd better therefore make some allowance forme!"
"There's no such thing as making allowances for you in meeting aftermeeting," Li Wan demurred laughing, "that you should again after thatgive out the rhymes in a reckless manner, waste your time and not showyourself able to put two lines together. You must absolutely bear apenalty today. I just caught a glimpse of the red plum in the Lung Ts'uimonastery; and how charming it is! I meant to have plucked a twig to putin a vase, but so loathsome is the way in which Miao Yue goes on, that Iwon't have anything to do with her! But we'll punish him by making him,for the sake of fun, fetch a twig for us to put in water."
"This penalty," they shouted with one accord, "is both excellent as wellas pleasant."
Pao-yue himself was no less delighted to carry it into execution, sosignifying his readiness to comply with their wishes, he felt desirousto be off at once.
"It's exceedingly cold outside," Hsiang-yuen and Tai-yue simultaneouslyremarked, "so have a glass of warm wine before you go."
Hsiang-yuen speedily took up the kettle, and Tai-yue handed him a largecup, filled to the very brim.
"Now swallow the wine we give you," Hsiang-yuen smiled. "And if you don'tbring any plum blossom, we'll inflict a double penalty."
Pao-yue gulped down hurry-scurry the whole contents of the cup andstarted on his errand in the face of the snow.
"Follow him carefully." Li Wan enjoined the servants.
Tai-yue, however, hastened to interfere and make her desist. "There's nosuch need," she cried. "Were any one to go with him, he'll contrariwisenot get the flowers."
Li Wan nodded her head. "Yes!" she assented, and then went on to directa waiting-maid to bring a vase, in the shape of a beautiful girl withhigh shoulders, to fill it with water, and get it ready to put the plumblossom in. "And when he comes back," she felt induced to add, "we mustrecite verses on the red plum."
"I'll indite a stanza in advance," eagerly exclaimed Hsiang-yuen.
"We'll on no account let you indite any more to-day," Pao-ch'ai laughed."You beat every one of us hollow; so if we sit with idle hands, therewon't be any fun. But by and bye we'll fine Pao-yue; and, as he says thathe can't pair antithetical lines, we'll now make him compose a stanzahimself."
"This is a capital idea!" Tai-yue smiled. "But I've got another proposal.As the lines just paired are not sufficient, won't it be well to pickout those who've put together the fewest distiches, and make themversify on the red plum blossom?"
"An excellent proposal!" Pao-ch'ai ventured laughing. "The three girlsHsing Chou-yen, Li Wen and Li Ch'i, failed just now to do justice totheir talents; besides they are visitors; and as Ch'in Erh, P'in Erh andYuen Erh got the best of us by a good deal, it's only right that none ofus should compose any more, and that that trio should only do so."
"Ch'i Erh," Li Wan thereupon retorted, "is also not a very good hand atverses, let therefore cousin Ch'in have a try!"
Pao-ch'ai had no alternative but to express her acquiescence.
"Let the three words 'red plum blossom,'" she then suggested, "be usedfor rhymes; and let each person compose an heptameter stanza. CousinHsing to indite on the word 'red;' your elder cousin Li on 'plum;' andCh'in Erh on 'blossom.'"
"If you let Pao-yue off," Li Wan interposed, "I won't have it!"
"I've got a capital theme," Hsiung-yuen eagerly remarked, "so let's makehim write some!"
"What theme is it?" one and all inquired.
"If we made him," Hsiang-yuen resumed, "versify on: 'In search of Miao Yueto beg for red plum blossom,' won't it be full of fun?"
"That will be full of zest," the party exclaimed, upon hearing the themepropounded by her. But hardly had they given expression to theirapproval than they perceived Pao-yue come in, beaming with smiles andglee, and holding with both hands a branch of red plum blossom. Themaids hurriedly relieved him of his burden and put the branch in thevase, and the inmates present came over in a body to feast their eyes onit.
"Well, may you look at it now," Pao-yue smiled. "You've no idea what anamount of trouble it has cost me!"
As he uttered these words, T'an Ch'un handed him at once another cup ofwarm wine; and the maids approached, and took his wrapper and hat, andshook off the snow.
But the servant-girls attached to their respective quarters then broughtthem over extra articles of clothing. Hsi Jen, in like manner,despatched a domestic with a pelisse, the worse for wear, lined with furfrom foxes' ribs, so Li Wan, having directed a servant to fill a platewith steamed large taros, and to make up two dishes with red-skinnedoranges, yellow coolie oranges, olives and other like things, bade someone take them over to Hsi Jen.
Hsiang-yuen also communicated to Pao-yue the subject for verses they haddecided upon a short while back. But she likewise urged Pao-yue to bequick and accomplish his task.
"Dear senior cousin, dear junior cousin," pleaded Pao-yue, "let me use myown rhymes. Don't bind me down to any."
"Go on as you like," they replied with one consent.
But conversing the while, they passed the plum blossom under inspection.
This bough of plum blossom was, in fact, only two feet in height; butfrom the side projected a branch, crosswise, about two or three feet inlength the small twigs and stalks on which resembled coiled dragons, orcrouching earthworms; and were either single and trimmed pencil-like, orthick and bushy grove-like. Indeed, their appearance was as if theblossom spurted cosmetic. This fragrance put orchids to the blush. Soevery one present contributed her quota of praise.
Chou-yen, Li Wen and Pao-ch'in had, little though it was expected, allthree already finished their lines and each copied them out for herself,so the company began to peruse their compositions, subjoined below, inthe order of the three words: 'red plum blossom.'
Verses to the red plum blossom by Hsing Chou-yen.
  The peach tree has not donned its fragrance yet, the almond is not      red.  What time it strikes the cold, it's first joyful to smile at the east      wind.  When its spirit to the Yue Ling hath flown, 'tis hard to say 'tis      spring.  The russet clouds across the 'Lo Fu' lie, so e'en to dreams it's      closed.  The green petals add grace to a coiffure, when painted candles burn.  The simple elf when primed with wine doth the waning rainbow bestride.  Does its appearance speak of a colour of ordinary run?  Both dark and light fall of their own free will into the ice and snow.
The next was the production of Li Wen, and its burden was:
  To write on the white plum I'm not disposed, but I'll write on the      red.  Proud of its beauteous charms, 'tis first to meet the opening drunken      eye.  On its frost-nipped face are marks; and these consist wholly of blood.  Its heart is sore, but no anger it knows; to ashes too it turns.  By some mistake a pill (a fairy) takes and quits her real frame.  From the fairyland pool she secret drops, and casts off her old form.  In spring, both north and south of the river, with splendour it doth      bloom.  Send word to bees and butterflies that they need not give way to      fears!
This stanza came next from the pen of Hsueeh Pao-ch'in,
  Far distant do the branches grow; but how beauteous the blossom      blooms!  The maidens try with profuse show to compete in their spring  head-dress.  No snow remains on the vacant pavilion and the tortuous rails.  Upon the running stream and desolate hills descend the russet clouds.  When cold prevails one can in a still dream follow the lass-blown      fife.  The wandering elf roweth in fragrant spring, the boat in the red      stream.  In a previous existence, it must sure have been of fairy form.  No doubt need 'gain arise as to its beauty differing from then.
The perusal over, they spent some time in heaping, smiling the while,eulogiums upon the compositions. And they pointed at the last stanza asthe best of the lot; which made it evident to Pao-yue that Pao-ch'in,albeit the youngest in years, was, on the other hand, the quickest inwits.
Tai-yue and Hsiang-yuen then filled up a small cup with wine andsimultaneously offered their congratulations to Pao-ch'in.
"Each of the three stanzas has its beauty," Pao-ch'ai remarked, a smileplaying round her lips. "You two have daily made a fool of me, and areyou now going to fool her also?"
"Have you got yours ready?" Li Wan went on to inquire of Pao-yue.
"I'd got them," Pao-yue promptly answered, "but the moment I read theirthree stanzas, I once more became so nervous that they quite slippedfrom my mind. But let me think again."
Hsiang-yuen, at this reply, fetched a copper poker, and, while beating onthe hand-stove, she laughingly said: "I shall go on tattooing. Now mindif when the drumming ceases, you haven't accomplished your task, you'llhave to bear another fine."
"I've already got them!" Pao-yue rejoined, smilingly.
Tai-yue then picked up a pencil. "Recite them," she smiled, "and I'llwrite them down."
Hsiang-yuen beat one stroke (on the stove). "The first tattoo is over,"she laughed.
"I'm ready," Pao-yue smiled. "Go on writing."
At this, they heard him recite:
  The wine bottle is not opened, the line is not put into shape.
Tai-yue noted it down, and shaking her head, "They begin very smoothly,"she said, as she smiled.
"Be quick!" Hsiang-yuen again urged.
Pao-yue laughingly continued:
  To fairyland I speed to seek for spring, and the twelfth moon to find.
Tai-yue and Hsiang-yuen both nodded. "It's rather good," they smiled.
Pao-yue resumed, saying:
  I will not beg the high god for a bottle of the (healing) dew,  But pray Shuang O to give me some plum bloom beyond the rails.
Tai-yue jotted the lines down and wagged her head to and fro. "They'reingenious, that's all," she observed.
Hsiang-yuen gave another rap with her hand.
Pao-yue thereupon smilingly added:
  I come into the world and, in the cold, I pick out some red snow.  I leave the dusty sphere and speed to pluck the fragrant purple      clouds.  I bring a jagged branch, but who in pity sings my shoulders thin?  On my clothes still sticketh the moss from yon Buddhistic court.
As soon as Tai-yue had done writing, Hsiang-yuen and the rest of thecompany began to discuss the merits of the verses; but they then sawseveral servant-maids rush in, shouting: "Our venerable mistress hascome."
One and all hurried out with all despatch to meet her. "How comes itthat she is in such good cheer?" every one also laughed.
Speaking the while, they discerned, at a great distance, theirgrandmother Chia seated, enveloped in a capacious wrapper, and rolled upin a warm hood lined with squirrel fur, in a small bamboo sedan-chairwith an open green silk glazed umbrella in her hand. Yuean Yang, Hu Poand some other girls, mustering in all five or six, held each anumbrella and pressed round the chair, as they advanced.
Li Wan and her companions went up to them with hasty step; but dowagerlady Chia directed the servants to make them stop; explaining that itwould be quite enough if they stood where they were.
On her approach, old lady Chia smiled. "I've given," she observed, "yourMadame Wang and that girl Feng the slip and come. What deep snow coversthe ground! For me, I'm seated in this, so it doesn't matter; but youmustn't let those ladies trudge in the snow."
The various followers rushed forward to take her wrapper and to supporther, and as they did so, they expressed their acquiescence.
As soon as she got indoors old lady Chia was the first to exclaim with abeaming face: "What beautiful plum blossom! You well know how to makemerry; but I too won't let you off!"
But in the course of her remarks, Li Wan quickly gave orders to adomestic to fetch a large wolf skin rug, and to spread it in the centre,so dowager lady Chia made herself comfortable on it. "Just go on asbefore with your romping and joking, drinking and eating," she thenlaughed. "As the days are so short, I did not venture to have a middaysiesta. After therefore playing at dominoes for a time, I bethoughtmyself of you people, and likewise came to join the fun."
Li Wan soon also presented her a hand-stove, while T'an Ch'un brought anextra set of cups and chopsticks, and filling with her own hands, a cupwith warm wine, she handed it to her grandmother Chia. Old lady Chiaswallowed a sip. "What's there in that dish?" she afterwards inquired.
The various inmates hurriedly carried it over to her, and explained that'they were pickled quails.'
"These won't hurt me," dowager lady Chia said, "so cut off a piece ofthe leg and give it to me."
"Yes!" promptly acquiesced Li Wan, and asking for water, she washed herhands, and then came in person to carve the quail.
"Sit down again," dowager lady Chia said, pressing them, "and go on withyour chatting and laughing. Let me hear you, and feel happy. Just youalso seat yourself," continuing, she remarked to Li Wan, "and behave asif I were not here. If you do so, well and good. Otherwise, I shall takemyself off at once."
But it was only when they heard how persistent she was in hersolicitations that they all resumed the seats, which accorded with theirage, with the exception of Li Wan, who moved to the furthest side.
"What were you playing at?" old lady Chia thereupon asked.
"We were writing verses," answered the whole party.
"Wouldn't it be well for those who are up to poetry," dowager lady Chiasuggested; "to devise a few puns for lanterns so that the whole lot ofus should be able to have some fun in the first moon?"
With one voice, they expressed their approval. But after they had jestedfor a little time; "It's damp in here;" old lady Chia said, "so don'tyou sit long, for mind you might be catching cold. Where it's nice andwarm is in your cousin Quarta's over there, so let's all go and see howshe is getting on with her painting, and whether it will be ready or notby the end of the year."
"How could it be completed by the close of the year?" they smiled. "Shecould only, we fancy, get it ready by the dragon boat festival nextyear."
"This is dreadful!" old lady Chia exclaimed. "Why, she has really wastedmore labour on it than would have been actually required to lay out thisgarden!"
With these words still on her lips, she ensconced herself again in thebamboo sedan, and closed in or followed by the whole company, sherepaired to the Lotus Fragrance Arbour, where they got into a narrowpassage, flanked on the east as well as the west, with doors from whichthey could cross the street. Over these doorways on the inside as wellas outside were inserted alike tablets made of stone. The door they wentin by, on this occasion, lay on the west. On the tablet facing outwards,were cut out the two words representing: 'Penetrating into the clouds.'On that inside, were engraved the two characters meaning: 'crossing tothe moon.' On their arrival at the hall, they walked in by the mainentrance, which looked towards the south. Dowager lady Chia thenalighted from her chair. Hsi Ch'un had already made her appearance outof doors to welcome her, so taking the inner covered passage, theypassed over to the other side and reached Hsi Ch'un's bedroom; on thedoor posts of which figured the three words: 'Warm fragrance isle.'Several servants were at once at hand; and no sooner had they raised thered woollen portiere, than a soft fragrance wafted itself into theirfaces. The various inmates stepped into the room. Old lady Chia,however, did not take a seat, but simply inquired where the paintingwas.
"The weather is so bitterly cold," Hsi Ch'un consequently explainedsmiling, "that the glue, whose property is mainly to coagulate, cannotbe moistened, so I feared that, were I to have gone on with thepainting, it wouldn't be worth looking at; and I therefore put it away."
"I must have it by the close of the year," dowager lady Chia laughed,"so don't idle your time away. Produce it at once and go on painting forme, as quick as you can."
But scarcely had she concluded her remark, than she unexpectedlyperceived lady Feng arrive, smirking and laughing, with a purplepelisse, lined with deer fur, thrown over her shoulders. "Venerablesenior!" she shouted, "You don't even so much as let any one knowto-day, but sneak over stealthily. I've had a good hunt for you!"
When old lady Chia saw her join them, she felt filled with delight. "Iwas afraid," she rejoined, "that you'd be feeling cold. That's why, Ididn't allow any one to tell you. You're really as sharp as a spirit tohave, at last, been able to trace my whereabouts! But according tostrict etiquette, you shouldn't show filial piety to such a degree!"
"Is it out of any idea of filial piety that I came after you? Not atall!" lady Feng added with a laugh. "But when I got to your place,worthy senior, I found everything so quiet that not even the caw of acrow could be heard, and when I asked the young maids where you'd gone,they wouldn't let me come and search in the garden. So I began to giveway to surmises. Suddenly also arrived two or three nuns; and then, atlength, I jumped at the conclusion that these women must have come tobring their yearly prayers, or to ask for their annual or incenseallowance, and that, with the amount of things you also, venerableancestor, have to do for the end of the year, you had for certain gotout of the way of your debts. Speedily therefore I inquired of the nunswhat it was that brought them there, and, for a fact, there was nomistake in my surmises. So promptly issuing the annual allowances tothem, I now come to report to you, worthy senior, that your creditorshave gone, and that there's no need for you to skulk away. But I've hadsome tender pheasant prepared; so please come, and have your eveningmeal; for if you delay any longer, it will get quite stale."
As she spoke, everybody burst out laughing. But lady Feng did not allowany time to dowager lady Chia to pass any observations, but forthwithdirected the servants to bring the chair over. Old lady Chia thensmilingly laid hold of lady Feng's hand and got again into her chair;but she took along with her the whole company of relatives for a chatand a laugh.
Upon issuing out of the gate on the east side of the narrow passage, thefour quarters presented to their gaze the appearance of being adornedwith powder, and inlaid with silver. Unawares, they caught sight ofPao-ch'in, in a duck down cloak, waiting at a distance at the back ofthe hill slope; while behind her stood a maid, holding a vase full ofred plum blossoms.
"Strange enough," they all exclaimed laughingly, "two of us weremissing! But she's waiting over there. She's also been after someplum-blossom."
"Just look," dowager lady Chia eagerly cried out joyfully, "that humancreature has been put there to match with the snow-covered hill! Butwith that costume, and the plum-blossom at the back of her, to what doesshe bear a resemblance?"
"She resembles," one and all smiled, "Chou Shih-ch'ou's beautiful snowpicture, suspended in your apartments, venerable ancestor."
"Is there in that picture any such costume?" Old lady Chia demurred,nodding her head and smiling. "What's more the persons represented in itcould never be so pretty!"
Hardly had this remark dropped from her mouth, than she discerned someone else, clad in a deep red woollen cloak, appear to view at the backof Pao-ch'in. "What other girl is that?" dowager lady Chia asked.
"We girls are all here." they laughingly answered. "That's Pao-yue."
"My eyes," old lady Chia smiled, "are getting dimmer and dimmer!"
So saying, they drew near, and of course, they turned out to be Pao-yueand Pao-ch'in.
"I've just been again to the Lung Ts'ui monastery," Pao-yue smiled toPao-ch'ai, Tai-yue and his other cousins, "and Miao Yue gave me for eachof you a twig of plum blossom. I've already sent a servant to take themover."
"Many thanks for the trouble you've been put to," they, with one voice,replied.
But speaking the while, they sallied out of the garden gate, andrepaired to their grandmother Chia's suite of apartments. Their mealover, they joined in a further chat and laugh, when unexpectedly theysaw Mrs. Hsueeh also arrive.
"With all this snow," she observed, "I haven't been over the whole dayto see how you, venerable senior, were getting on. Your ladyshipcouldn't have been in a good sort of mood to-day, for you should havegone and seen the snow."
"How not in a good mood?" old lady Chia exclaimed. "I went and looked upthese young ladies and had a romp with them for a time."
"Last night," Mrs. Hsueeh smiled, "I was thinking of getting from ourMadame Wang to-day the loan of the garden for the nonce and spreadingtwo tables with our mean wine, and inviting you, worthy senior, to enjoythe snow; but as I saw that you were having a rest, and I heard, at anearly hour, that Pao-yue had said that you were not in a joyful frame ofmind, I did not, in consequence, presume to come and disturb you to-day.But had I known sooner the real state of affairs, I would have felt itmy bounden duty to have asked you round."
"This is," rejoined dowager lady Chia with a smile, "only the first fallof snow in the tenth moon. We'll have, after this, plenty of snowy daysso there will be ample time to put your ladyship to wasteful expense."
"Verily in that case," Mrs. Hsueeh laughingly added, "my filialintentions may well be looked upon as having been accomplished."
"Mrs. Hsueeh," interposed lady Feng smiling, "mind you don't forget it!But you might as well weigh fifty taels this very moment, and hand themover to me to keep, until the first fall of snow, when I can geteverything ready for the banquet. In this way, you will neither haveanything to bother you, aunt, nor will you have a chance of forgetting."
"Well, since that be so," old lady Chia remarked with a laugh, "yourladyship had better give her fifty taels, and I'll share it with her;each one of us taking twenty-five taels; and on any day it might snow,I'll pretend I don't feel in proper trim and let it slip by. You'll havethus still less occasion to trouble yourself, and I and lady Feng willreap a substantial benefit."
Lady Feng clapped her hands. "An excellent idea," she laughed. "Thisquite falls in with my views."
The whole company were much amused.
"Pshaw!" dowager lady Chia laughingly ejaculated. "You barefaced thing!(You're like a snake, which) avails itself of the rod, with which it isbeing beaten, to crawl up (and do harm)! You don't try to convince usthat it properly devolves upon us, as Mrs. Hsueeh is our guest andreceives such poor treatment in our household, to invite her; for withwhat right could we subject her ladyship to any reckless outlay? but youhave the impudence, of impressing upon our minds to insist upon thepayment, in advance, of fifty taels! Are you really not thoroughlyashamed of yourself?"
"Oh, worthy senior," lady Feng laughed, "you're most sharp-sighted! Youtry to see whether Mrs. Hsueeh will be soft enough to produce fifty taelsfor you to share with me, but fancying now that it's of no avail, youturn round and begin to rate me by coming out with all these grandwords! I won't however take any money from you, Mrs. Hsueeh. I'll, infact, contribute some on your ladyship's account, and when I get thebanquet ready and invite you, venerable ancestor, to come and partake ofit, I'll also wrap fifty taels in a piece of paper, and dutifullypresent them to you, as a penalty for my officious interference inmatters that don't concern me. Will this be all right or not?"
Before these words were brought to a close, the various inmates were soconvulsed with hearty laughter that they reeled over on the stove-couch.
Dowager lady Chia then went on to explain how much nicer Pao-ch'in was,plucking plum blossom in the snow, than the very picture itself; and shenext minutely inquired what the year, moon, day and hour of her birthwere, and how things were getting on in her home.
Mrs. Hsueeh conjectured that the object she had in mind was, in allprobability, to seek a partner for her. In the secret recesses of herheart, Mrs. Hsueeh on this account fell in also with her views.(Pao-ch'in) had, however, already been promised in marriage to the Meifamily. But as dowager lady Chia had made, as yet, no open allusion toher intentions, (Mrs. Hsueeh) did not think it nice on her part to comeout with any definite statement, and she accordingly observed to oldlady Chia in a vague sort of way: "What a pity it is that this girlshould have had so little good fortune as to lose her father the yearbefore last. But ever since her youth up, she has seen much of theworld, for she has been with her parent to every place of note. Herfather was a man fond of pleasure; and as he had business in everydirection, he took his family along with him. After tarrying in thisprovince for a whole year, he would next year again go to that province,and spend half a year roaming about it everywhere. Hence it is that hehad visited five or six tenths of the whole empire. The other year, whenthey were here, he engaged her to the son of the Hanlin Mei. But, as ithappened, her father died the year after, and here is her mother too nowailing from a superfluity of phlegm."
Lady Feng gave her no time to complete what she meant to say. "Hai!" sheexclaimed, stamping her foot. "What you say isn't opportune! I was aboutto act as a go-between. But is she too already engaged?"
"For whom did you mean to act as go-between?" old lady Chia smiled.
"My dear ancestor," lady Feng remarked, "don't concern yourself aboutit! I had determined in my mind that those two would make a suitablematch. But as she has now long ago been promised to some one, it wouldbe of no use, were I even to speak out. Isn't it better that I shouldhold my peace, and drop the whole thing?"
Dowager lady Chia herself was cognizant of lady Feng's purpose, so uponhearing that she already had a suitor, she at once desisted from makingany further reference to the subject. The whole company then continuedanother chat on irrelevant matters for a time, after which, they brokeup.
Nothing of any interest transpired the whole night. The next day, thesnowy weather had cleared up. After breakfast, her grandmother Chiaagain pressed Hsi Ch'un. "You should go on," she said, "with yourpainting, irrespective of cold or heat. If you can't absolutely finishit by the end of the year, it won't much matter! The main thing is thatyou must at once introduce in it Ch'in Erh and the maid with the plumblossom, as we saw them yesterday, in strict accordance with theoriginal and without the least discrepancy of so much as a stroke."
Hsi Ch'un listened to her and felt it her duty to signify her assent, inspite of the task being no easy one for her to execute.
After a time, a number of her relatives came, in a body, to watch theprogress of the painting. But they discovered Hsi Ch'un plunged in areverie. "Let's leave her alone," Li Wan smilingly observed to them all,"to proceed with her meditations; we can meanwhile have a chat amongourselves. Yesterday our worthy senior bade us devise a fewlantern-conundrums, so when we got home, I and Ch'i Erh and Wen Erh didnot turn in (but set to work). I composed a couple on the Four Books;but those two girls also managed to put together another pair of them."
"We should hear what they're like," they laughingly exclaimed in chorus,when they heard what they had done. "Tell them to us first, and let'shave a guess!"
  "The goddess of mercy has not been handed down by any ancestors."
Li Ch'i smiled. "This refers to a passage in the Four Books."
  "In one's conduct, one must press towards the highest benevolence."
Hsiang-yuen quickly interposed; taking up the thread of the conversation.
"You should ponder over the meaning of the three words implying: 'handeddown by ancestors'," Pao-ch'ai smiled, "before you venture a guess."
"Think again!" Li Wan urged with a smile.
"I've guessed it!" Tai-yue smiled. "It's:
 "'If, notwithstanding all that benevolence, there be no outward visible      sign...'"
"That's the line," one and all unanimously exclaimed with a laugh.
  "'The whole pond is covered with rush.'"
"Now find the name of the rush?" Li Wan proceeded.
"This must certainly be the cat-tail rush!" hastily again repliedHsiang-yuen. "Can this not be right?"
"You've succeeded in guessing it," Li Wan smiled. "Li Wen's is:
 "'Cold runs the stream along the stones;'
"bearing on the name of a man of old."
"Can it be Shan T'ao?" T'an Ch'un smilingly asked.
"It is!" answered Li Wan.
"Ch'i Erh's is the character 'Yung' (glow-worm). It refers to a singleword," Li Wan resumed.
The party endeavoured for a long time to hit upon the solution.
"The meaning of this is certainly deep," Pao-ch'in put in. "I wonderwhether it's the character, 'hua,' (flower) in the combination, 'huats'ao, (vegetation)."
"That's just it!" Li Ch'i smiled.
"What has a glow-worm to do with flowers?" one and all observed.
"It's capital!" Tai-yue ventured with a smile. "Isn't a glow-wormtransformed from plants?"
The company grasped the sense; and, laughing the while, they, with oneconsent, shouted out, "splendid!"
"All these are, I admit, good," Pao-ch'ai remarked, "but they won't suitour venerable senior's taste. Won't it be better therefore to compose afew on some simple objects; some which all of us, whether polished orunpolished, may be able to enjoy?"
"Yes," they all replied, "we should also think of some simple ones onordinary objects."
"I've devised one on the 'Tien Chiang Ch'un' metre," Hsiang-yuen pursued,after some reflection. "But it's really on an ordinary object. So tryand guess it."
Saying this, she forthwith went on to recite:
  The creeks and valleys it leaves;  Travelling the world, it performs.  In truth how funny it is!  But renown and gain are still vain;  Ever hard behind it is its fate.
A conundrum.
None of those present could fathom what it could be. After protractedthought, some made a guess, by saying it was a bonze. Others maintainedthat it was a Taoist priest. Others again divined that it was amarionette.
"All your guesses are wrong," Pao-yue chimed in, after considerablereflection. "I've got it! It must for a certainty be a performingmonkey."
"That's really it!" Hsiang-yuen laughed.
"The first part is all right," the party observed, "but how do youexplain the last line?"
"What performing monkey," Hsiang-yuen asked, "has not had its tail cutoff?"
Hearing this, they exploded into a fit of merriment. "Even," theyargued, "the very riddles she improvises are perverse and strange!"
"Mrs. Hsueeh mentioned yesterday that you, cousin Ch'in, had seen much ofthe world," Li Wan put in, "and that you had also gone about a gooddeal. It's for you therefore to try your hand at a few conundrums.What's more your poetry too is good. So why shouldn't you indite a fewfor us to guess?"
Pao-ch'in, at this proposal, nodded her head, and while repressing asmile, she went off by herself to give way to thought.
Pao-ch'ai then also gave out this riddle:
  Carved sandal and cut cedar rise layer upon layer.  Have they been piled and fashioned by workmen of skill!  In the mid-heavens it's true, both wind and rain fleet by;  But can one hear the tingling of the Buddhists' bell?
While they were giving their mind to guessing what it could be, Pao-yuetoo recited:
  Both from the heavens and from the earth, it's indistinct to view.  What time the 'Lang Ya' feast goes past, then mind you take great      care.  When the 'luan's' notes you catch and the crane's message thou'lt look      up:  It is a splendid thing to turn and breathe towards the vault of      heaven, (a kite)
Tai-yue next added:
  Why need a famous steed be a with bridle e'er restrained?  Through the city it speeds; the moat it skirts; how fierce it looks.  The master gives the word and wind and clouds begin to move.  On the 'fish backs' and the 'three isles' it only makes a name, (a      rotating lantern).
T'an Ch'un had also one that she felt disposed to tell them, but just asshe was about to open her lips, Pao-ch'in walked up to them. "The relicsof various places I've seen since my youth," she smiled, "are not few,so I've now selected ten places of historic interest, on which I'vecomposed ten odes, treating of antiquities. The verses may possibly becoarse, but they bear upon things of the past, and secretly refer aswell to ten commonplace articles. So, cousins, please try and guessthem!"
"This is ingenious!" they exclaimed in chorus, when they heard theresult of her labour. "Why not write them out, and let us have a look atthem?"
But, reader, peruse the next chapter, if you want to learn what follows.

CHAPTER LI.
  The young maiden Hsueeh Pao-ch'in devises, in novel style, odes bearing      on antiquities.  A stupid doctor employs, in reckless manner, drugs of great strength.
When the party heard, the story goes, that Pao-ch'in had made the oldplaces of interest she had, in days gone by, visited in the variousprovinces, the theme of her verses, and that she had composed tenstanzas with four lines in each, which though referring to relics ofantiquity, bore covertly on ten common objects, they all opined thatthey must be novel and ingenious, and they vied with each other inexamining the text. On perusal, they read:
On the relics of Ch'ih Pi:
  Deep in Ch'ih Pi doth water lie concealed which does not onward flow.  There but remains a name and surname contained in an empty boat.  When with a clamorous din the fire breaks out, the sad wind waxes      cold.  An endless host of eminent spirits wander about inside.
On the ancient remains in Chiao Chih:
  Posts of copper and walls of gold protect the capital.  Its fame is spread beyond the seas, scattered in foreign lands.  How true it is that Ma Yuean's achievements have been great.  The flute of iron need not trouble to sing of Tzu Fang.
On the vestiges of former times in Chung Shan:
  Renown and gain do they, at any time, fall to a woman's share?  For no reason have I been bidden come into the mortal world.  How hard a task, in point of fact, it is to stop solicitude!  Don't bear a grudge against such people as may oft times jeer at you!
On things of historic interest in Huai Yin:
  The sturdy man must ever mind the insults of the vicious dog.  Th' official's rank in San Ch'i was but fixed when his coffin was      closed  Tell all people that upon earth do dwell to look down upon none.  The bounty of one single bowl of rice should be treasured till death.
On events of old in Kuang Lin:
  Cicadas chirp; crows roost; but, in a twinkle, they are gone.  How fares these latter days the scenery in Sui T'i?  It's all because he has so long enjoyed so fine a fame,  That he has given rise around to so many disputes.
On the ancient remains of the T'ao Yeh ferry:
  Dry grass and parched plants their reflex cast upon the shallow pond.  The peach tree branches and peach leaves will bid farewell at last.  What a large number of structures in Liu Ch'ao raise their heads.  A small picture with a motto hangs on the hollow wall.
On the antique vestiges of Ch'ing Chung:
  The black stream stretches far and wide, but hindered is its course.  What time were no more thrummed the frozen cords, the songs waxed sad.  The policy of the Han dynasty was in truth strange!  A worthless officer must for a thousand years feel shame.
On things of historic renown in Ma Wei:
  Quiet the spots of rouge with sweat pile up and shine.  Gentleness in a moment vanishes and goes.  It is because traces remain of his fine looks,  That to this day his clothes a fragrance still emit.
On events of the past connected with the Pu Tung temple:
  The small red lamp is wholly made of thin bone, and is light.  Furtively was it brought along but by force was it stol'n.  Oft was it, it is true, hung by the mistress' own hands,  But long ere this has she allured it to speed off with her.
On the scenery about the Mei Hua (Plum Bloom) monastery.
  If not by the plum trees, then by the willows it must be.  Has any one picked up in there the likeness of a girl?  Don't fret about meeting again; in spring its scent returns.  Soon as it's gone, and west winds blow, another year has flown.
When the party had done reading the verses, they with perfect unanimityextolled their extraordinary excellence. Pao-ch'ai was, however, thefirst to raise any objections. "The first eight stanzas," she said, "arefounded upon the testimony of the historical works. But as for the lasttwo stanzas, there's no knowing where they come from. Besides, we don'tquite fathom their meaning. Wouldn't it be better then if two otherstanzas were written?"
Tai-yue hastened to interrupt her. "The lines composed by cousin Paoch'in are indeed devised in a too pigheaded and fast-and-loose sort ofway," she observed. "The two stanzas are, I admit, not to be traced inthe historical works, but though we've never read such outsidetraditions, and haven't any idea what lies at the bottom of them, havewe not likely seen a couple of plays? What child of three years oldhasn't some notion about them, and how much more such as we?"
"What she says is perfectly correct," T'an Ch'un chimed in.
"She has besides," Li Wan then remarked, "been to these places herself.But though there be no mention anywhere of these two references,falsehoods have from old till now been propagated, and busybodies have,in fact, intentionally invented such relics of ancient times with a viewof bamboozling people. That year, for instance, in which we travelled uphere to the capital, we came across graves raised to Kuan, the sage, inthree or four distinct places. Now the circumstances of the wholeexistence of Kuan the sage are established by actual proof, so how couldthere again in his case exist a lot of graves? This must arise from theesteem in which he is held by posterity for the way he acquitted himselfof his duties during his lifetime. And it is presumably to this esteemthat this fiction owes its origin. This is quite possible enough. Evenin the 'Kuang Yue Chi', you will see that not only are numerous tombs ofthe sage Kuan spoken of, but that bygone persons of note are assignedtombs not few in number. But there are many more relics of antiquity,about which no testimony can be gathered. The matter treated in the twostanzas, now in point, is, of course, not borne out by any actualrecord; yet in every story, that is told, in every play, that is sung,and on the various slips as well used for fortune telling, it isinvariably to be found. Old and young, men and women, do all understandit and speak of it, whether in proverbs or in their everyday talk. Theydon't resemble, besides, the ballads encountered in the 'Hsi HsiangChi,' and 'Mou Tan T'ing,' to justify us to fear that we might besetting eyes upon some corrupt text. They are quite harmless; so we'dbetter keep them!"
Pao-ch'ai, after these arguments, dropped at length all discussion. Theythereupon tried for a time to guess the stanzas. None, however, of theirsolutions turned out to be correct. But as the days in winter are short,and they saw that it was time for their evening meal, they adjourned tothe front part of the compound for their supper.
The servants at this stage announced to Madame Wang that Hsi Jen's elderbrother, Hua Tzu-fang, was outside, and reported to her that he hadentered the city to say that his mother was lying in bed dangerouslyill, and that she was so longing to see her daughter that he had come tobeg for the favour of taking Hsi Jen home on a visit. As soon as MadameWang heard the news, she dilated for a while upon people's mothers anddaughters, and of course she did not withhold her consent. Sendingtherefore at the same time for lady Feng, she communicated the tidingsto her, and enjoined her to deliberate, and take suitable action.
Lady Feng signified her willingness to do what was necessary, and,returning to her quarters, she there and then commissioned Chou Jui'swife to go and break the news to Hsi Jen. "Send also," she went on todirect Mrs. Chou, "for one of the married-women, who are in attendancewhen we go out-of-doors, and let you two, together with a couple ofyoung maids, follow Hsi Jen home. But despatch four cart attendants,well up in years, to look everywhere for a spacious curricle for you aswell as her, and a small carriage for the maids."
"All right!" acquiesced Chou Jui's wife. But just as she was about tostart, lady Feng continued her injunctions. "Hsi Jen," she added; "is aperson not fond of any fuss, so tell her that it's I who have given theorders; and impress upon her that she must put on several nice, colouredclothes, and pack up a large valise full of wearing apparel. Her valise,must be a handsome one; and she must take a decent hand-stove. Bid hertoo first come and look me up here when she's about to start."
Mrs. Chou promised to execute her directions and went on her way.
After a long interval, (lady Feng) actually saw Hsi Jen arrive, got upin full costume and head-gear, and with her two waiting-maids and ChouJui's wife, who carried the hand-stove and the valise packed up withclothes. Lady Feng's eye was attracted by several golden hairpins andpearl ornaments of great brilliancy and beauty, which Hsi Jen wore inher coiffure. Her gaze was further struck by the peach-red stiff silkjacket she had on, brocaded with all sorts of flowers and lined withermine, by her leek-green wadded jupe, artistically ornamented withcoils of gold thread, and by the bluish satin and grey squirrel pelisseshe was wrapped in.
"These three articles of clothing, given to you by our dowager lady,"lady Feng smiled, "are all very nice; but this pelisse is somewhat tooplain. If you wear this, you'll besides feel cold, so put on one withlong fur."
"Our Madame Wang," Hsi Jen laughingly rejoined, "gave me this one withthe grey squirrel. I've also got one with ermine. She says that when theend of the year draws nigh, she'll let me have one with long fur."
"I've got one with long fur," lady Feng proceeded with a smile. "I don'tfancy it much as the fringe does not hang with grace. I was on the pointof having it changed; but, never mind, I'll let you first use it; and,when at the close of the year, Madame Wang has one made for you, I canthen have mine altered, and it will come to the same thing as if youwere returning it like that to me."
One and all laughed. "That's the way of talking into which her ladyshiphas got!" they observed. "There she is the whole year round recklesslycarelessly and secretly making good, on Madame Wang's account, ever somany things; how many there is no saying; for really the things forwhich compensation is made, cannot be so much as enumerated; and doesshe ever go, and settle scores with Madame Wang? and here she comes, onthis occasion, and gives vent again to this mean language, in order topoke fun at people!"
"How could Madame Wang," lady Feng laughed, "ever give a thought to suchtrifles as these? They are, in fact, matters of no consequence. Yet wereI not to look after them, it would be a disgrace to all of us, andneedless to say, I would myself get into some scrape. It's far betterthat I should dress you all properly, and so get a fair name and finish;for were each of you to cut the figure of a burnt cake, people wouldfirst and foremost ridicule me, by saying that in looking after thehousehold I have, instead of doing good, been the means of makingbeggars of you!"
After hearing her out, the whole party heaved a sigh. "Who could everbe," they exclaimed, "so intuitively wise as you, to show, above, suchregard for Madame Wang, and below, such consideration for hersubordinates?"
In the course of these remarks, they noticed lady Feng bid P'ing Erhfind the dark green stiff silk cloak with white fox, she had worn theday before, and give it to Hsi Jen. But perceiving, also, that in theway of a valise, she only had a double one made of black spotted,figured sarcenet, with a lining of light red pongee silk, and that itscontents consisted merely of two wadded jackets, the worse for wear, anda pelisse, lady Feng went on to tell P'ing Erh to fetch a woollenwrapper, lined with jade-green pongee. But she ordered her besides topack up a snow-cloak for her.
P'ing Erh walked away and produced the articles. The one was made ofdeep-red felt, and was old. The other was of deep-red soft satin,neither old nor new.
"I don't deserve so much as a single one of these," Hsi Jen said.
"Keep this felt one for yourself," P'ing Erh smiled, "and take this onealong with you and tell some one to send it to that elderly girl, whowhile every one, in that heavy fall of snow yesterday, was rolled up insoft satin, if not in felt, and while about ten dark red dresses werereflected in the deep snow and presented such a fine sight, was the onlyone attired in those shabby old clothes. She seems more than ever toraise her shoulders and double her back. She is really to be pitied; sotake this now and give it to her!"
"She surreptitiously wishes to give my things away!" lady Feng laughed."I haven't got enough to spend upon myself and here I have you, betterstill, to instigate me to be more open-handed!"
"This comes from the filial piety your ladyship has ever displayedtowards Madame Wang," every one laughingly remarked, "and the fond lovefor those below you. For had you been mean and only thought of makingmuch of things and not cared a rap for your subordinates, would thatgirl have presumed to behave in this manner?"
"If any one therefore has read my heart, it's she," lady Feng rejoinedwith a laugh, "but yet she only knows it in part."
At the close of this rejoinder, she again spoke to Hsi Jen. "If yourmother gets well, all right," she said; "but if anything happens to her,just stay over, and send some one to let me know so that I may speciallydespatch a servant to bring you your bedding. But whatever you do,don't, use their bedding, nor any of their things to comb your hairwith. As for you people," continuing, she observed to Mrs. Chou Jui,"you no doubt are aware of the customs, prevailing in thisestablishment, so that I can dispense with giving you any injunctions."
"Yes, we know them all," Mrs. Chou Jui assented. "As soon as we getthere, we'll, of course, request their male inmates to retire out of theway. And in the event of our having to stay over, we'll naturally applyfor one or two extra inner rooms."
With these words still on her lips, she followed Hsi Jen out of theapartment. Then directing the servant-boys to prepare the lanterns,they, in due course, got into their curricle, and came to Hua Tzu-fang'squarters, where we will leave them without any further comment.
Lady Feng, meanwhile, sent also for two nurses from the I Hung court. "Iam afraid," she said to them, "that Hsi Jen won't come back, so if therebe any elderly girl, who has to your knowledge, so far, had her witsabout her, depute her to come and keep night watch in Pao-yue's rooms.But you nurses must likewise take care and exercise some control, foryou mustn't let Pao-yue recklessly kick up any trouble!"
"Quite so," answered the two nurses, agreeing to her directions, afterwhich, they quitted her presence. But not a long interval expired beforethey came to report the result of their search. "We've set our choiceupon Ch'ing Wen and She Yueeh to put up in his rooms," they reported. "Wefour will take our turn and look after things during the night."
When lady Feng heard these arrangements, she nodded her head. "Atnight," she observed, "urge him to retire to bed soon; and in themorning press him to get up at an early hour."
The nurses replied that they would readily carry out her orders andreturned alone into the garden.
In a little time Chou Jui's wife actually brought the news, which sheimparted to lady Feng, that: "as her mother was already beyond hope, HsiJen could not come back."
Lady Feng then explained things to Madame Wang, and sent, at the sametime, servants to the garden of Broad Vista to fetch (Hsi Jen's) beddingand toilet effects.
Pao-yue watched Ch'ing Wen and She Yueeh get all her belongings in properorder. After the things had been despatched, Ch'ing Wen and She Yueehdivested themselves of their remaining fineries and changed their jupesand jackets. Ch'ing Wen seated herself round a warming-frame.
"Now," She Yueeh smiled, "you're not to put on the airs of a young lady!I advise you to also move about a bit."
"When you're all clean gone," Ch'ing Wen returned for answer, "I shallhave ample time to budge. But every day that you people are here, Ishall try and enjoy peace and quiet."
"My dear girl," She Yueeh laughed, "I'll make the bed, but drop the coverover that cheval-glass and put the catches right; you are so much tallerthan I."
So saying, she at once set to work to arrange the bed for Pao-yue.
"Hai!" ejaculated Ch'ing Wen smiling, "one just sits down to warm one'sself, and here you come and disturb one!"
Pao-yue had at this time been sitting, plunged in a despondent mood. Thethought of Hsi Jen's mother had crossed through his mind and he waswondering whether she could be dead or alive, when unexpectedlyoverhearing Ch'ing Wen pass the remarks she did, he speedily sprung up,and came out himself and dropped the cover of the glass, and fastenedthe contrivance, after which he walked into the room. "Warm yourselves,"he smiled, "I've done all there was to be done."
"I can't manage," Ch'ing Wen rejoined smiling, "to get warm at all. Itjust also strikes me that the warming-pan hasn't yet been brought."
"You've had the trouble to think of it!" She Yueeh observed. "But you'venever wanted a chafing-dish before. It's so warm besides on thatwarming-frame of ours; not like the stove-couch in that room, which isso cold; so we can very well do without it to-day."
"If both of you are to sleep on that," Pao-yue smiled, "there won't be asoul with me outside, and I shall be in an awful funk. Even you won't beable to have a wink of sleep during the whole night!"
"As far as I'm concerned," Ch'ing Wen put in, "I'm going to sleep inhere. There's She Yueeh, so you'd better induce her to come and sleepoutside."
But while they kept up this conversation, the first watch drew near, andShe Yueeh at once lowered the mosquito-curtain, removed the lamp, burntthe joss-sticks, and waited upon Pao-yue until he got into bed. The twomaids then retired to rest. Ch'ing Wen reclined all alone on thewarming-frame, while She Yueeh lay down outside the winter apartments.
The third watch had come and gone, when Pao-yue, in the midst of a dream,started calling Hsi Jen. He uttered her name twice, but no one was aboutto answer him. And it was after he had stirred himself out of sleep thathe eventually recalled to mind that Hsi Jen was not at home, and he hada hearty fit laughter to himself.
Ch'ing Wen however had been roused out of her sleep, and she called SheYueeh. "Even I," she said, "have been disturbed, fast asleep though Iwas; and, lo, she keeps a look-out by his very side and doesn't as yetknow anything about his cries! In very deed she is like a stiff corpse!"
She Yueeh twisted herself round and yawned. "He calls Hsi Jen," shesmilingly rejoined, "so what's that to do with me? What do you want?"proceeding, she then inquired of him.
"I want some tea," Pao-yue replied.
She Yueeh hastily jumped out of bed, with nothing on but a short waddedcoat of red silk.
"Throw my pelisse over you;" Pao-yue cried; "for mind it's cold!"
She Yueeh at these words put back her hands, and, taking the warmpelisse, lined even up to the lapel, with fur from the neck of thesable, which Pao-yue had put on on getting up, she threw it over hershoulders and went below and washed her hands in the basin. Then fillingfirst a cup with tepid water, she brought a large cuspidor for Pao-yue towash his mouth. Afterwards, she drew near the tea-case, and getting acup, she first rinsed it with lukewarm water, and pouring half a cup oftea from the warm teapot, she handed it to Pao-yue. After he had done,she herself rinsed her mouth, and swallowed half a cupful of tea.
"My dear girl," Ch'ing Wen interposed smiling, "do give me also a sip."
"You put on more airs than ever," She Yueeh laughed.
"My dear girl;" Ch'ing Wen added, "to-morrow night, you needn't budge;I'll wait on you the whole night long. What do you say to that?"
Hearing this, She Yueeh had no help but to attend to her as well, whileshe washed her mouth, and to pour a cup of tea and give it to her todrink.
"Won't you two go to sleep," She Yueeh laughed, "but keep on chatting?I'll go out for a time; I'll be back soon."
"Are there any evil spirits waiting for you outside?" Ch'ing Wen smiled.
"It's sure to be bright moonlight out of doors," Pao-yue observed, "sogo, while we continue our chat."
So speaking, he coughed twice.
She Yueeh opened the back-door, and raising the woollen portiere andlooking out, she saw what a beautiful moonlight there really was.
Ch'ing Wen allowed her just time enough to leave the room, when she felta wish to frighten her for the sake of fun. But such reliance did shehave in her physique, which had so far proved better than that ofothers, that little worrying her mind about the cold, she did not eventhrow a cloak over her, but putting on a short jacket, she descended,with gentle tread and light step, from the warming-frame and was makingher way out to follow in her wake, when "Hallo!" cried Pao-yue warningher. "It's freezing; it's no joke!"
Ch'ing Wen merely responded with a wave of the hand and sallied out ofthe door to go in pursuit of her companion. The brilliancy of the moon,which met her eye, was as limpid as water. But suddenly came a slightgust of wind. She felt it penetrate her very flesh and bore through herbones. So much so, that she could not help shuddering all over. "Littlewonder is it," she argued within herself, "if people say 'that onemustn't, when one's body is warm, expose one's self to the wind.' Thiscold is really dreadful!" She was at the same time just on the point ofgiving (She Yueeh) a start, when she heard Pao-yue shout from inside,"Ch'ing Wen has come out."
Ch'ing Wen promptly turned back and entered the room. "How could I everfrighten her to death?" she laughed. "It's just your way; you're asgreat a coward as an old woman!"
"It isn't at all that you might do her harm by frightening her," Pao-yuesmiled, "but, in the first place, it wouldn't be good for you to getfrost-bitten; and, in the second, you would take her so much off herguard that she won't be able to prevent herself from uttering a shout.So, in the event of rousing any of the others out of their sleep, theywon't say that we are up to jokes, but maintain instead that just as HsiJen is gone, you two behave as if you'd come across ghosts or seen evilspirits. Come and tuck in the coverlets on this side!"
When Ch'ing Wen heard what he wanted done she came accordingly andtucked in the covers, and, putting out her hands, she inserted themunder them, and set to work to warm the bedding.
"How cold your hand is!" Pao-yue laughingly exclaimed. "I told you tolook out or you'd freeze!"
Noticing at the same time that Ch'ing Wen's cheeks were as red as rouge,he rubbed them with his hands. But as they felt icy cold to his touch,"Come at once under the cover and warm yourself!" Pao-yue urged.
Hardly, however, had he concluded these words, than a sound of 'lo teng'reached their ears from the door, and She Yueeh rushed in all in atremor, laughing the while.
"I've had such a fright," she smiled, as she went on speaking. "Goodnessme! I saw in the black shade, at the back of the boulders on that hill,some one squatting, and was about to scream, when it turned out to benothing else than that big golden pheasant. As soon as it caught sightof a human being, it flew away. But it was only when it reached amoonlit place that I at last found out what it was. Had I been soheedless as to scream, I would have been the means of getting people outof their beds!"
Recounting her experiences, she washed her hands.
"Ch'ing Wen, you say, has gone out," she proceeded laughing, "but how isit I never caught a glimpse of her? She must certainly have gone tofrighten me!"
"Isn't this she?" Pao-yue inquired with a smile. "Is she not here warmingherself? Had I not been quick in shouting, she would verily have givenyou a fright."
"There was no need for me to go and frighten her," Ch'ing Wen laughinglyobserved. "This hussy has frightened her own self."
With these words she ensconced herself again under her own coverlet."Did you forsooth go out," She Yueeh remarked, "in this smart dress of acircus-performer?"
"Why, of course, she went out like this!" Pao-yue smiled.
"You wouldn't know, for the life of you, how to choose a felicitousday!" She Yueeh added. "There you go and stand about on a fruitlesserrand. Won't your skin get chapped from the frost?"
Saying this, she again raised the copper cover from the brasier, and,picking up the shovel, she buried the live charcoal deep with ashes, andtaking two bits of incense of Cambodia fragrant wood, she threw themover them. She then re-covered the brasier, and repairing to the back ofthe screen, she gave the lamp a thorough trimming to make it throw outmore light; after which, she once more laid herself down.
As Ch'ing Wen had some time before felt cold, and now began to get warmagain, she unexpectedly sneezed a couple of times.
"How about that?" sighed Pao-yue. "There you are; you've after all caughta chill!"
"Early this morning," She Yueeh smiled, "she shouted that she wasn'tfeeling quite herself. Neither did she have the whole day a proper bowlof food. And now, not to speak of her taking so little care of herself,she is still bent upon playing larks upon people! But if she falls illby and bye, we'll let her suffer what she will have brought uponherself."
"Is your head hot?" Pao-yue asked.
"It's nothing at all!" Ch'ing Wen rejoined, after coughing twice. "Whendid I get so delicate?"
But while she spoke, they heard the striking clock, suspended on thepartition wall in the outer rooms, give two sounds of 'tang, tang,' andthe matron, on the night watch outside, say: "Now, young girls, go tosleep. To-morrow will be time enough for you to chat and laugh!"
"Don't let's talk!" Pao-yue then whispered, "for, mind, we'll also inducethem to start chattering." After this, they at last went to sleep.
The next day, they got up at an early hour. Ch'ing Wen's nose was indeedconsiderably stopped. Her voice was hoarse; and she felt no inclinationto move.
"Be quick," urged Pao-yue, "and don't make a fuss, for your mistress, mymother, may come to know of it, and bid you also shift to your house andnurse yourself. Your home might, of course, be all very nice, but it'sin fact somewhat cold. So isn't it better here? Go and lie down in theinner rooms, and I'll give orders to some one to send for the doctor tocome quietly by the back door and have a look at you. You'll then getall right again."
"In spite of what you say," Ch'ing Wen demurred, "you must really saysomething about it to our senior lady, Mrs. Chia Chu; otherwise thedoctor will be coming unawares, and people will begin to ask questions;and what answer could one give them?"
Pao-yue found what she said so full of reason that he called an oldnurse. "Go and deliver this message to your senior mistress," heenjoined her. "Tell her that Ch'ing Wen got a slight chill yesterday.That as it's nothing to speak of, and Hsi Jen is besides away, therewould be, more than ever, no one here to look after things, were she togo home and attend to herself, so let her send for a doctor to comequietly by the back entrance and see what's the matter with her; butdon't let her breathe a word about it to Madame Wang, my mother."
The old nurse was away a considerable time on the errand. On her return,"Our senior mistress," she reported, "has been told everything. She saysthat: 'if she gets all right, after taking a couple of doses ofmedicine, it will be well and good. But that in the event of notrecovering, it would, really, be the right thing for her to go to herown home. That the season isn't healthy at present, and that if theother girls caught her complaint it would be a small thing; but that thegood health of the young ladies is a vital matter.'"
Ch'ing Wen was lying in the winter apartment, coughing and coughing,when overhearing (Li Wan's) answer, she lost control over her temper."Have I got such a dreadful epidemic," she said, "that she fears that Ishall bring it upon others? I'll clear off at once from this place; formind you don't get any headaches and hot heads during the course of yourlives."
"While uttering her grievances, she was bent upon getting upimmediately, when Pao-yue hastened to smile and to press her down.
"Don't lose your temper," he advised her. "This is a responsibilitywhich falls upon her shoulders, so she is afraid lest Madame Wang mightcome to hear of it, and call her to task. She only made a harmlessremark. But you've always been prone to anger, and now, as a matter ofcourse your spleen is larger than ever."
But in the middle of his advice to her, a servant came and told him thatthe doctor had arrived. Pao-yue accordingly crossed over to the off side,and retired behind the bookcase; from whence he perceived two or threematrons, whose duty it was to keep watch at the back door, usher thedoctor in.
The waiting-maids, meanwhile, withdrew out of the way. Three or four oldnurses dropped the deep-red embroidered curtain, suspended in the winterapartment. Ch'ing Wen then simply stretched out her hand from among thefolds of the curtain. But the doctor noticed that on two of the fingersof her hand, the nails, which measured fully two or three inches inlength, still bore marks of the pure red dye from the China balsam, andforthwith he turned his head away. An old nurse speedily fetched a toweland wiped them for her, when the doctor set to work and felt her pulsefor a while, after which he rose and walked into the outer chamber.
"Your young lady's illness," he said to the old nurses, "arises fromexternal sources, and internal obstructive influences, caused by theunhealthiness of the season of late. Yet it's only a slight chill, afterall. Fortunately, the young lady has ever been moderate in her drinkingand eating. The cold she has is nothing much. It's mainly because shehas a weak constitution that she has unawares got a bit of a chill. Butif she takes a couple of doses of medicine to dispel it with, she'll bequite right."
So saying, he followed once more the matron out of the house.
Li Wan had, by this time, sent word to the various female domestics atthe back entrance, as well as to the young maids in the different partsof the establishment to keep in retirement. All therefore that thedoctor perceived as he went along was the scenery in the garden. But nota single girl did he see.
Shortly, he made his exit out of the garden gate, and taking a seat inthe duty-lodge of the servant-lads, who looked after thegarden-entrance, he wrote a prescription.
"Sir," urged an old nurse, "don't go yet. Our young master is fretfuland there may be, I fancy, something more to ask you."
"Wasn't the one I saw just now a young lady," the doctor exclaimed witheagerness, "but a young man, eh? Yet the rooms were such as are occupiedby ladies. The curtains were besides let down. So how could the patientI saw have ever been a young man?"
"My dear sir," laughed the old nurse, "it isn't strange that aservant-girl said just now that a new doctor had been sent for on thisoccasion, for you really know nothing about our family matters. Thatroom is that of our young master, and that is a girl attached to theapartments; but she's really a servant-maid. How ever were those a younglady's rooms? Had a young lady fallen ill, would you ever havepenetrated inside with such ease?"
With these words, she took the prescription and wended her way into thegarden.
When Pao-yue came to peruse it, he found, above, such medicines mentionedas sweet basil, platycodon, carraway seeds, mosla dianthera, and thelike; and, below, citrus fusca and sida as well.
"He deserves to be hanged! He deserves death!" Pao-yue shouted. "Here hetreats girls in the very same way as he would us men! How could thisever do? No matter what internal obstruction there may be, how could sheever stand citrus and sida? Who asked him to come? Bundle him off atonce; and send for another, who knows what he's about."
"Whether he uses the right medicines or not," the old nurse pleaded, "weare not in a position to know. But we'll now tell a servant-lad to goand ask Dr. Wang round. It's easy enough! The only thing is that as thisdoctor wasn't sent for through the head manager's office his fee must bepaid to him."
"How much must one give him?" Pao-yue inquired.
"Were one to give him too little, it wouldn't look nice," a matronventured. "He should be given a tael. This would be quite the thing withsuch a household as ours."
"When Dr. Wang comes," Pao-yue asked, "how much is he given?"
"Whenever Dr. Wang and Dr. Chang come," a matron smilingly explained,"no money is ever given them. At the four seasons of each year howeverpresents are simply sent to them in a lump. This is a fixed annualcustom. But this new doctor has come only this once so he should begiven a tael."
After this explanation, Pao-yue readily bade She Yueeh go and fetch themoney.
"I can't make out where sister Hua put it;" She Yueeh rejoined.
"I've often seen her take money out of that lacquered press, ornamentedwith designs made with shells;" Pao-yue added; "so come along with me,and let's go and search."
As he spoke, he and She Yueeh came together into what was used as astore-room by Hsi Jen. Upon opening the shell-covered press, they foundthe top shelf full of pens, pieces of ink, fans, scented cakes, variouskinds of purses, handkerchiefs and other like articles, while on thelower shelf were piled several strings of cash. But, presently theypulled out the drawer, when they saw, in a small wicker basket, severalpieces of silver, and a steelyard.
She Yueeh quickly snatched a piece of silver. Then raising the steelyard,"Which is the one tael mark?" she asked.
Pao-yue laughed. "It's amusing that you should appeal to me!" he said."You really behave as if you had only just come!"
She Yueeh also laughed, and was about to go and make inquiries of someone else, when Pao-yue interfered. "Choose a piece out of those big onesand give it to him, and have done," he said. "We don't go in for buyingand selling, so what's the use of minding such trifles!"
She Yueeh, upon hearing this, dropped the steelyard, and selected apiece, which she weighed in her hand. "This piece," she smiled, "must, Ifancy, be a tael. But it would be better to let him have a little more.Don't let's give too little as those poor brats will have a laugh at ourexpense. They won't say that we know nothing about the steelyard; butthat we are designedly mean."
A matron who stood at the threshold of the door, smilingly chimed in."This ingot," she said, "weighs five taels. Even if you cut half of itoff, it will weigh a couple of taels, at least. But there are no syceeshears at hand, so, miss, put this piece aside and choose a smallerone."
She Yueeh had already closed the press and walked out. "Who'll go andfumble about again?" she laughed. "If there's a little more, well, youtake it and finish."
"Be quick," Pao-yue remarked, "and tell Pei Ming to go for anotherdoctor. It will be all right."
The matron received the money and marched off to go and settle matters.
Presently, Dr. Wang actually arrived, at the invitation of Pei Ming.First and foremost he felt the pulse and then gave the same diagnosis ofthe complaint (as the other doctor did) in the first instance. The onlydifference being that there was, in fact, no citrus or sida or othersimilar drugs, included in the prescription. It contained, however,false sarsaparilla roots, dried orange peel, peonia albifora, and othersimilar medicines. But the quantities were, on the other hand,considerably smaller, as compared with those of the drugs mentioned inthe former prescription.
"These are the medicines," Pao-yue ejaculated exultingly, "suitable forgirls! They should, it's true, be of a laxative nature, but never overand above what's needful. When I fell ill last year, I suffered from achill, but I got such an obstruction in the viscera that I could neithertake anything liquid or substantial, yet though he saw the state I wasin, he said that I couldn't stand sida, ground gypsum, citrus and othersuch violent drugs. You and I resemble the newly-opened white begonia,Yuen Erh sent me in autumn. And how could you resist medicines which aretoo much for me? We're like the lofty aspen trees, which grow inpeople's burial grounds. To look at, the branches and leaves are ofluxuriant growth, but they are hollow at the core."
"Do only aspen trees grow in waste burial grounds?" She Yueeh smiled. "Isit likely, pray, that there are no fir and cypress trees? What's moreloathsome than any other is the aspen. For though a lofty tree, it onlyhas a few leaves; and it makes quite a confused noise with the slightestpuff of wind! If you therefore deliberately compare yourself to it,you'll also be ranging yourself too much among the common herd!"
"I daren't liken myself to fir or cypress;" Pao-yue laughingly retorted."Even Confucius says: 'after the season waxes cold, one finds that thefir and cypress are the last to lose their foliage,' which makes itevident that these two things are of high excellence. Thus it's thoseonly, who are devoid of every sense of shame, who foolishly likenthemselves to trees of the kind!"
While engaged in this colloquy, they perceived the old matron bring thedrugs, so Pao-yue bade her fetch the silver pot, used for boilingmedicines in, and then he directed her to prepare the decoction on thebrasier.
"The right thing would be," Ch'ing Wen suggested, "that you should letthem go and get it ready in the tea-room; for will it ever do to fillthis room with the smell of medicines?"
"The smell of medicines," Pao-yue rejoined, "is far nicer than thatemitted by the whole lot of flowers. Fairies pick medicines and preparemedicines. Besides this, eminent men and cultured scholars gathermedicines and concoct medicines; so that it constitutes a most excellentthing. I was just thinking that there's everything and anything in theserooms and that the only thing that we lack is the smell of medicines;but as luck would have it, everything is now complete."
Speaking, he lost no time in giving orders to a servant to put themedicines on the fire. Next, he advised She Yueeh to get ready a fewpresents and bid a nurse take them and go and look up Hsi Jen, andexhort her not to give way to excessive grief. And when he had settledeverything that had to be seen to, he repaired to the front to dowagerlady Chia's and Madame Wang's quarters, and paid his respects and hadhis meal.
Lady Feng, as it happened, was just engaged in consulting with old ladyChia and Madame Wang. "The days are now short as well as cold," sheargued, "so wouldn't it be advisable that my senior sister-in-law, Mrs.Chia Chu, should henceforward have her repasts in the garden, along withthe young ladies? When the weather gets milder, it won't at all matter,if they have to run backward and forward."
"This is really a capital idea!" Madame Wang smiled. "It will be soconvenient during windy and rainy weather. To inhale the chilly airafter eating isn't good. And to come quite empty, and begin piling up alot of things in a stomach full of cold air isn't quite safe. It wouldbe as well therefore to select two cooks from among the women, who have,anyhow, to keep night duty in the large five-roomed house, inside thegarden back entrance, and station them there for the special purpose ofpreparing the necessary viands for the girls. Fresh vegetables aresubject to some rule of distribution, so they can be issued to them fromthe general manager's office. Or they might possibly require money or bein need of some things or other. And it will be all right if a few ofthose pheasants, deer, and every kind of game, be apportioned to them."
"I too was just thinking about this," dowager lady Chia observed. "Theonly thing I feared was that with the extra work that would again bethrown upon the cook-house, they mightn't have too much to do."
"There'll be nothing much to do," lady Feng replied. "The sameapportionment will continue as ever. In here, something may be added;but in there something will be reduced. Should it even involve a littletrouble, it will be a small matter. If the girls were exposed to thecold wind, every one else might stand it with impunity; but how couldcousin Lin, first and foremost above all others, resist anything of thekind? In fact, brother Pao himself wouldn't be proof against it. What'smore, none of the various young ladies can boast of a strongconstitution."
What rejoinder old lady Chia made to lady Feng, at the close of herrepresentations, is not yet ascertained; so, reader, listen to theexplanations you will find given in the next chapter.

CHAPTER LII.
  The beautiful P'ing Erh endeavours to conceal the loss of the      bracelet, made of work as fine as the feelers of a shrimp.  The brave Ch'ing Wen mends the down-cloak during her indisposition.
But let us return to our story.
"Quite so!" was the reply with which dowager lady Chia (greeted ladyFeng's proposal). "I meant the other day to have suggested thisarrangement, but I saw that every one of you had so many urgent mattersto attend to, (and I thought) that although you would not presume tobear me a grudge, were several duties now again superadded, you wouldunavoidably imagine that I only regarded those young grandsons andgranddaughters of mine, and had no consideration for any of you, whohave to look after the house. But since you make this suggestionyourself, it's all right."
And seeing that Mrs. Hsueeh, and 'sister-in-law' Li were sitting withher, and that Madame Hsing, and Mrs. Yu and the other ladies, who hadalso crossed over to pay their respects, had not as yet gone to theirquarters, old lady Chia broached the subject with Madame Wang, and therest of the company. "I've never before ventured to give utterance tothe remarks that just fell from my lips," she said, "as first of all Iwas in fear and trembling lest I should have made that girl Feng morepresumptuous than ever, and next, lest I should have incurred thedispleasure of one and all of you. But since you're all here to-day, andevery one of you knows what brothers' wives and husbands' sisters mean,is there (I ask) any one besides her as full of forethought?"
Mrs. Hsueeh, 'sister-in-law' Li and Mrs. Yu smiled with one consent."There are indeed but few like her!" they cried. "That of others issimply a conventional 'face' affection, but she is really fond of herhusband's sisters and his young brother. In fact, she's as genuinelyfilial with you, venerable senior."
Dowager lady Chia nodded her head. "Albeit I'm fond of her," she sighed,"I can't, on the other hand, help distrusting that excessive shrewdnessof hers, for it isn't a good thing."
"You're wrong there, worthy ancestor," lady Feng laughed with alacrity."People in the world as a rule maintain that 'too shrewd and clever aperson can't, it is feared, live long.' Now what people of the worldinvariably say people of the world invariably believe. But of you alone,my dear senior, can no such thing be averred or believed. For there youare, ancestor mine, a hundred times sharper and cleverer than I; and howis it that you now enjoy both perfect happiness and longevity? But Ipresume that I shall by and bye excel you by a hundredfold, and die atlength, after a life of a thousand years, when you venerable seniorshall have departed from these mortal scenes!"
"After every one is dead and gone," dowager lady Chia laughinglyobserved, "what pleasure will there be, if two antiquated elves, likeyou and I will be, remain behind?"
This joke excited general mirth.
But so concerned was Pao-yue about Ch'ing Wen and other matters that hewas the first to make a move and return into the garden. On his arrivalat his quarters, he found the rooms full of the fragrance emitted by themedicines. Not a soul did he, however, see about. Ch'ing Wen wasreclining all alone on the stove-couch. Her face was feverish and red.When he came to touch it, his hand experienced a scorching sensation.Retracing his steps therefore towards the stove, he warmed his hands andinserted them under the coverlet and felt her. Her body as well was ashot as fire.
"If the others have left," he then remarked, "there's nothing strangeabout it, but are She Yueeh and Ch'iu Wen too so utterly devoid offeeling as to have each gone after her own business?"
"As regards Ch'iu Wen," Ch'ing Wen explained, "I told her to go and haveher meal. And as for She Yueeh, P'ing Erh came just now and called herout of doors and there they are outside confabbing in a mysterious way!What the drift of their conversation can be I don't know. But they mustbe talking about my having fallen ill, and my not leaving this place togo home."
"P'ing Erh isn't that sort of person," Pao-yue pleaded. "Besides, she hadno idea whatever about your illness, so that she couldn't have comespecially to see how you were getting on. I fancy her object was to lookup She Yueeh to hobnob with her, but finding unexpectedly that you werenot up to the mark, she readily said that she had come on purpose tofind what progress you were making. This was quite a natural thing for aperson with so wily a disposition to say, for the sake of preservingharmony. But if you don't go home, it's none of her business. You twohave all along been, irrespective of other things, on such good termsthat she could by no means entertain any desire to injure the friendlyrelations which exist between you, all on account of something thatdoesn't concern her."
"Your remarks are right enough," Ch'ing Wen rejoined, "but I do suspecther, as why did she too start, all of a sudden, imposing upon me?"
"Wait, I'll walk out by the back door," Pao-yue smiled, "and go to thefoot of the window, and listen to what she's saying. I'll then come andtell you."
Speaking the while, he, in point of fact, sauntered out of the backdoor; and getting below the window, he lent an ear to their confidences.
"How did you manage to get it?" She Yueh inquired with gentle voice.
"When I lost sight of it on that day that I washed my hands," P'ing Erhanswered, "our lady Secunda wouldn't let us make a fuss. But the momentshe left the garden, she there and then sent word to the nurses,stationed in the various places, to institute careful search. Oursuspicions, however, fell upon Miss Hsing's maid, who has ever also beenpoverty-stricken; surmising that a young girl of her age, who had neverset eyes upon anything of the kind, may possibly have picked it up andtaken it. But never did we positively believe that it could be some onefrom this place of yours! Happily, our lady Secunda wasn't in the room,when that nurse Sung who is with you here went over, and said, producingthe bracelet, 'that the young maid, Chui Erh, had stolen it, and thatshe had detected her, and come to lay the matter before our ladySecunda. I promptly took over the bracelet from her; and recollectinghow imperious and exacting Pao-yue is inclined to be, fond and devoted ashe is to each and all of you; how the jade which was prigged the otheryear by a certain Liang Erh, is still, just as the matter has cooleddown for the last couple of years, canvassed at times by some peopleeager to serve their own ends; how some one has now again turned up topurloin this gold trinket; how it was filched, to make matters worse,from a neighbour's house; how as luck would have it, she took this ofall things; and how it happened to be his own servant to give him a slapon his mouth, I hastened to enjoin nurse Sung to, on no accountwhatever, let Pao-yue know anything about it, but simply pretend thatnothing of the kind had transpired, and to make no mention of it to anysingle soul. In the second place,' (I said), 'our dowager lady andMadame Wang would get angry, if they came to hear anything. Thirdly, HsiJen as well as yourselves would not also cut a very good figure.' Henceit was that in telling our lady Secunda, I merely explained 'that on myway to our senior mistress,' the bracelet got unclasped, without myknowing it; that it fell among the roots of the grass; that there was nochance of seeing it while the snow was deep, but that when the snowcompletely disappeared to-day there it glistened, so yellow and bright,in the rays of the sun, in precisely the very place where it haddropped, and that I then picked it up.' Our lady Secunda at oncecredited my version. So here I come to let you all know so as to behenceforward a little on your guard with her, and not get her a jobanywhere else. Wait until Hsi Jen's return, and then devise means topack her off, and finish with her."
"This young vixen has seen things of this kind before," She Yueehejaculated, "and how is it that she was so shallow-eyed?"
"What could, after all, be the weight of this bracelet?" P'ing Erhobserved. "It was once our lady Secunda's. She says that this is calledthe 'shrimp-feeler'-bracelet. But it's the pearl, which increases itsweight. That minx Ch'ing Wen is as fiery as a piece of cracklingcharcoal, so were anything to be told her, she may, so little able isshe to curb her temper, flare up suddenly into a huff, and beat or scoldher, and kick up as much fuss as she ever has done before. That's why Isimply tell you. Exercise due care, and it will be all right."
With this warning, she bid her farewell and went on her way.
Her words delighted, vexed and grieved Pao-yue. He felt delighted, onaccount of the consideration shown by P'ing Erh for his own feelings.Vexed, because Chui Erh had turned out a petty thief. Grieved, that ChuiErh, who was otherwise such a smart girl, should have gone in for thisdisgraceful affair. Returning consequently into the house, he toldCh'ing Wen every word that P'ing Erh had uttered. "She says," he went onto add, "that you're so fond of having things all your own way that wereyou to hear anything of this business, now that you are ill, you wouldget worse, and that she only means to broach the subject with you, whenyou get quite yourself again."
Upon hearing this, Ch'ing Wen's ire was actually stirred up, and herbeautiful moth-like eyebrows contracted, and her lovely phoenix eyesstared wide like two balls. So she immediately shouted out for Chui Erh.
"If you go on bawling like that," Pao-yue hastily remonstrated with her,"won't you show yourself ungrateful for the regard with which P'ing Erhhas dealt with you and me? Better for us to show ourselves sensible ofher kindness and by and bye pack the girl off, and finish."
"Your suggestion is all very good," Ch'ing Wen demurred, "but how couldI suppress this resentment?"
"What's there to feel resentment about?" Pao-yue asked. "Just you takegood care of yourself; it's the best thing you can do."
Ch'ing Wen then took her medicine. When evening came, she had anothercouple of doses. But though in the course of the night, she broke outinto a slight perspiration, she did not see any change for the better inher state. Still she felt feverish, her head sore, her nose stopped, hervoice hoarse. The next day, Dr. Wang came again to examine her pulse andsee how she was getting on. Besides other things, he increased theproportions of certain medicines in the decoction and reduced others;but in spite of her fever having been somewhat brought down, her headcontinued to ache as much as ever.
"Go and fetch the snuff," Pao-yue said to She Yueeh, "and give it to herto sniff. She'll feel more at ease after she has had several strongsneezes."
She Yueeh went, in fact, and brought a flat crystal bottle, inlaid with acouple of golden stars, and handed it to Pao-yue.
Pao-yue speedily raised the cover of the bottle. Inside it, hediscovered, represented on western enamel, a fair-haired young girl, ina state of nature, on whose two sides figured wings of flesh. Thisbottle contained some really first-rate foreign snuff.
Ch'ing Wen's attention was fixedly concentrated on the representation.
"Sniff a little!" Pao-yue urged. "If the smell evaporates, it won't beworth anything."
Ch'ing Wen, at his advice, promptly dug out a little with her nail, andapplied it to her nose. But with no effect. So digging out again a goodquantity of it, she pressed it into her nostrils. Then suddenly sheexperienced a sensation in her nose as if some pungent matter hadpenetrated into the very duct leading into the head, and she sneezedfive or six consecutive times, until tears rolled down from her eyes andmucus trickled from her nostrils.
Ch'ing Wen hastily put the bottle away. "It's dreadfully pungent!" shelaughed. "Bring me some paper, quick!"
A servant-girl at once handed her a pile of fine paper.
Ch'ing Wen extracted sheet after sheet, and blew her nose.
"Well," said Pao-yue smiling, "how are you feeling now?"
"I'm really considerably relieved." Ch'ing Wen rejoined laughing. "Theonly thing is that my temples still hurt me."
"Were you to treat yourself exclusively with western medicines, I'm sureyou'd get all right," Pao-yue added smilingly. Saying this, "Go," heaccordingly desired She Yueeh, "to our lady Secunda, and ask her forsome. Tell her that I spoke to you about them. My cousin over thereoften uses some western plaster, which she applies to her temples whenshe's got a headache. It's called 'I-fo-na.' So try and get some of it!"
She Yueeh expressed her readiness. After a protracted absence, she, invery deed, came back with a small bit of the medicine; and going quicklyfor a piece of red silk cutting, she got the scissors and slit two roundslips off as big as the tip of a finger. After which, she took themedicine, and softening it by the fire, she spread it on them with ahairpin.
Ch'ing Wen herself laid hold of a looking-glass with a handle and stuckthe bits on both her temples.
"While you were lying sick," She Yueeh laughed, "you looked like amangy-headed devil! But with this stuff on now you present a fine sight!As for our lady Secunda she has been so much in the habit of stickingthese things about her that they don't very much show off with her!"
This joke over, "Our lady Secunda said," she resumed, addressing herselfto Pao-yue, "'that to-morrow is your maternal uncle's birthday, and thatour mistress, your mother, asked her to tell you to go over. Thatwhatever clothes you will put on to-morrow should be got ready to-night,so as to avoid any trouble in the morning.'"
"Anything that comes first to hand," Pao-yue observed, "will do wellenough! There's no getting, the whole year round, at the end of all thefuss of birthdays!"
Speaking the while, he rose to his feet and left the room with the ideaof repairing to Hsi Ch'un's quarters to have a look at the painting. Assoon as he got outside the door of the court-yard, he unexpectedly spiedPao-ch'in's young maid, Hsiao Lo by name, crossing over from theopposite direction. Pao-yue, with rapid step, strode up to her, andinquired of her whither she was going.
"Our two young ladies," Hsiao Lo answered with a smile, "are in MissLin's rooms; so I'm also now on my way thither."
Catching this answer, Pao-yue wheeled round and came at once with her tothe Hsiao Hsiang Lodge. Here not only did he find Pao-ch'ai and hercousin, but Hsing Chou-yen as well. The quartet was seated in a circleon the warming-frame; carrying on a friendly chat on everyday domesticmatters; while Tzu Chuean was sitting in the winter apartment, working atsome needlework by the side of the window.
The moment they caught a glimpse of him, their faces beamed with smiles."There comes some one else!" they cried. "There's no room for you tosit!"
"What a fine picture of beautiful girls, in the winter chamber!" Pao-yuesmiled. "It's a pity I come a trifle too late! This room is, at allevents, so much warmer than any other, that I won't feel cold if I plantmyself on this chair."
So saying, he made himself comfortable on a favourite chair of Tai-yue'sover which was thrown a grey squirrel cover. But noticing in the winterapartment a jadestone bowl, full of single narcissi, in clusters ofthree or five, Pao-yue began praising their beauty with all the languagehe could command. "What lovely flowers!" he exclaimed. "The warmer theroom gets, the stronger is the fragrance emitted by these flowers! Howis it I never saw them yesterday?"
"These are," Tai-yue laughingly explained, "from the two pots ofnarcissi, and two pots of allspice, sent to Miss Hsueeh Secunda by thewife of Lai Ta, the head butler in your household. Of these, she gave mea pot of narcissi; and to that girl Yuen, a pot of allspice. I didn't atfirst mean to keep them, but I was afraid of showing no considerationfor her kind attention. But if you want them, I'll, in my turn, presentthem to you. Will you have them; eh?"
"I've got two pots of them in my rooms," Pao-yue replied, "but they'renot up to these. How is it you're ready to let others have what cousinCh'in has given you? This can on no account do!"
"With me here," Tai-yue added, "the medicine pot never leaves the fire,the whole day long. I'm only kept together by medicines. So how could Iever stand the smell of flowers bunging my nose? It makes me weaker thanever. Besides, if there's the least whiff of medicines in this room, itwill, contrariwise, spoil the fragrance of these flowers. So isn't itbetter that you should have them carried away? These flowers will thenbreathe a purer atmosphere, and won't have any mixture of smells toannoy them."
"I've also got now some one ill in my place," Pao-yue retorted with asmile, "and medicines are being decocted. How comes it you happen toknow nothing about it?"
"This is strange!" Tai-yue laughed. "I was really speaking quitethoughtlessly; for who ever knows what's going on in your apartments?But why do you, instead of getting here a little earlier to listen toold stories, come at this moment to bring trouble and vexation upon yourown self?"
Pao-yue gave a laugh. "Let's have a meeting to-morrow," he proposed, "forwe've also got the themes. Let's sing the narcissus and allspice."
"Never mind, drop that!" Tai-yue rejoined, upon hearing his proposal. "Ican't venture to write any more verses. Whenever I indite any, I'mmulcted. So I'd rather not be put to any great shame."
While uttering these words she screened her face with both hands.
"What's the matter?" Pao-yue smiled. "Why are you again making fun of me?I'm not afraid of any shame, but, lo, you screen your face."
"The next time," Pao-ch'ai felt impelled to interpose laughingly, "Iconvene a meeting, we'll have four themes for odes and four for songs;and each one of us will have to write four odes and four roundelays. Thetheme of the first ode will treat of the plan of the great extreme; therhyme fixed being 'hsien,' (first), and the metre consisting of fivewords in each line. We'll have to exhaust every one of the rhymes under'hsien,' and mind, not a single one may be left out."
"From what you say," Pao-ch'in smilingly observed, "it's evident thatyou're not in earnest, cousin, in setting the club on foot. It's clearenough that your object is to embarrass people. But as far as the versesgo, we could forcibly turn out a few, just by higgledy-piggledy takingseveral passages from the 'Canon of Changes,' and inserting them in ourown; but, after all, what fun will there be in that sort of thing? WhenI was eight years of age, I went with my father to the western seaboardto purchase foreign goods. Who'd have thought it, we came across a girlfrom the 'Chen Chen' kingdom. She was in her eighteenth year, and herfeatures were just like those of the beauties one sees represented inforeign pictures. She had also yellow hair, hanging down, and arrangedin endless plaits. Her whole head was ornamented with one mass ofcornelian beads, amber, cats' eyes, and 'grandmother-green-stone.' Onher person, she wore a chain armour plaited with gold, and a coat, whichwas up to the very sleeves, embroidered in foreign style. In a belt, shecarried a Japanese sword, also inlaid with gold and studded withprecious gems. In very truth, even in pictures, there is no one asbeautiful as she. Some people said that she was thoroughly conversantwith Chinese literature, and could explain the 'Five classics,' that shewas able to write odes and devise roundelays, and so my father requestedan interpreter to ask her to write something. She thereupon wrote anoriginal stanza, which all, with one voice, praised for its remarkablebeauty, and extolled for its extraordinary merits."
"My dear cousin," eagerly smiled Pao-yue, "produce what she wrote, andlet's have a look at it."
"It's put away in Nanking;" Pao-ch'in replied with a smile. "So howcould I at present go and fetch it?"
Great was Pao-yue's disappointment at this rejoinder. "I've no luck," hecried, "to see anything like this in the world."
Tai-yue laughingly laid hold of Pao-ch'in. "Don't be humbugging us!" sheremarked. "I know well enough that you are not likely, on a visit likethis, to have left any such things of yours at home. You must havebrought them along. Yet here you are now again palming off a fib on usby saying that you haven't got them with you. You people may believewhat she says, but I, for my part, don't."
Pao-ch'in got red in the face. Drooping her head against her chest, shegave a faint smile; but she uttered not a word by way of response.
"Really P'in Erh you've got into the habit of talking like this!"Pao-ch'ai laughed. "You're too shrewd by far."
"Bring them along," Tai-yue urged with a smile, "and give us a chance ofseeing something and learning something; it won't hurt them."
"There's a whole heap of trunks and baskets," Pao-ch'ai put in laughing,"which haven't been yet cleared away. And how could one tell in whichparticular one, they're packed up? Wait a few days, and when things willhave been put straight a bit, we'll try and find them: and every one ofus can then have a look at them; that will be all right. But if youhappen to remember the lines," she pursued, speaking to Pao-ch'in, "whynot recite them for our benefit?"
"I remember so far that her lines consisted of a stanza with fivecharacters in each line," Pao-ch'ai returned for answer. "For a foreigngirl, they're verily very well done."
"Don't begin for a while," Pao-ch'ai exclaimed. "Let me send for YuenErh, so that she too might hear them."
After this remark, she called Hsiao Lo to her. "Go to my place," sheobserved, "and tell her that a foreign beauty has come over, who's asplendid hand at poetry. 'You, who have poetry on the brain,' (say toher), 'are invited to come and see her,' and then lay hold of thisverse-maniac of ours and bring her along."
Hsiao Lo gave a smile, and went away. After a long time, they heardHsiang-yuen laughingly inquire, "What foreign beauty has come?" But whileasking this question, she made her appearance in company with HsiangLing.
"We heard your voices long before we caught a glimpse of your persons!"the party laughed.
Pao-ch'in and her companions motioned to her to sit down, and, in duecourse, she reiterated what she had told them a short while back.
"Be quick, out with it! Let's hear what it is!" Hsiang-yuen smilinglycried.
Pao-ch'in thereupon recited:
  Last night in the Purple Chamber I dreamt.  This evening on the 'Shui Kuo' Isle I sing.  The clouds by the isle cover the broad sea.  The zephyr from the peaks reaches the woods.  The moon has never known present or past.  From shallow and deep causes springs love's fate.  When I recall my springs south of the Han,  Can I not feel disconsolate at heart?
After listening to her, "She does deserve credit," they unanimouslyshouted, "for she really is far superior to us, Chinese though we be."
But scarcely was this remark out of their lips, when they perceived SheYueeh walk in. "Madame Wang," she said, "has sent a servant to informyou, Master Secundus, that 'you are to go at an early hour to-morrowmorning to your maternal uncle's, and that you are to explain to himthat her ladyship isn't feeling quite up to the mark, and that shecannot pay him a visit in person.'"
Pao-yue precipitately jumped to his feet (out of deference to hismother), and signified his assent, by answering 'Yes.' He then went onto inquire of Pao-ch'ai and Pao-ch'in, "Are you two going?"
"We're not going," Pao-ch'ai rejoined. "We simply went there yesterdayto take our presents over but we left after a short chat."
Pao-yue thereupon pressed his female cousins to go ahead and he thenfollowed them. But Tai-yue called out to him again and stopped him. "Whenis Hsi Jen, after all, coming back?" she asked.
"She'll naturally come back after she has accompanied the funeral,"Pao-yue retorted.
Tai-yue had something more she would have liked to tell him, but shefound it difficult to shape it into words. After some moments spent inabstraction, "Off with you!" she cried.
Pao-yue too felt that he treasured in his heart many things he would fainconfide to her, but he did not know what to bring to his lips, so aftercogitating within himself for a time, he likewise observed smilingly:"We'll have another chat to-morrow," and, as he said so, he wended hisway down the stairs. Lowering his head, he was just about to take a stepforward, when he twisted himself round again with alacrity. "Now thatthe nights are longer than they were, you're sure to cough often andwake several times in the night; eh?" he asked.
"Last night," Tai-yue answered, "I was all right; I coughed only twice.But I only slept at the fourth watch for a couple of hours and then Icouldn't close my eyes again."
"I really have something very important to tell you," Pao-yue proceededwith another smile. "It only now crossed my mind." Saying this, heapproached her and added in a confidential tone: "I think that thebirds' nests sent to you by cousin Pao-chai...."
Barely, however, had he had time to conclude than he spied dame Chaoenter the room to pay Tai-yue a visit. "Miss, have you been all rightthese last few days?" she inquired.
Tai-yue readily guessed that this was an attention extended to her merelyas she had, on her way back from T'an Ch'un's quarters, to pass by herdoor, so speedily smiling a forced smile, she offered her a seat.
"Many thanks, dame Chao," she said, "for the trouble of thinking of me,and for coming in person in this intense cold."
Hastily also bidding a servant pour the tea, she simultaneously winkedat Pao-yue.
Pao-yue grasped her meaning, and forthwith quitted the apartment. As thishappened to be about dinner time, and he had been enjoined as well byMadame Wang to be back at an early hour, Pao-yue returned to hisquarters, and looked on while Ch'ing Wen took her medicine. Pao-yue didnot desire Ch'ing Wen this evening to move into the winter apartment,but stayed with Ch'ing Wen outside; and, giving orders to bring thewarming-frame near the winter apartment, She Yueh slept on it.
Nothing of any interest worth putting on record transpired during thenight. On the morrow, before the break of day, Ch'ing Wen aroused SheYueh.
"You should awake," she said. "The only thing is that you haven't hadenough sleep. If you go out and tell them to get the water for tea readyfor him, while I wake him, it will be all right."
She Yueh immediately jumped up and threw something over her. "Let's callhim to get up and dress in his fine clothes." she said. "We can summonthem in, after this fire-box has been removed. The old nurses told usnot to allow him to stay in this room for fear the virus of the diseaseshould pass on to him; so now if they see us bundled up together in oneplace, they're bound to kick up another row."
"That's my idea too," Ch'ing Wen replied.
The two girls were then about to call him, when Pao-yue woke up of hisown accord, and speedily leaping out of bed, he threw his clothes overhim.
She Yueeh first called a young maid into the room and put thingsshipshape before she told Ch'in Wen and the other servant-girls toenter; and along with them, she remained in waiting upon Pao-yue while hecombed his hair, and washed his face and hands. This part of his toiletover, She Yueeh remarked: "It's cloudy again, so I suppose it's going tosnow. You'd better therefore wear a woollen overcoat!"
Pao-yue nodded his head approvingly; and set to work at once to effectthe necessary change in his costume. A young waiting-maid then presentedhim a covered bowl, in a small tea tray, containing a decoction made ofFu-kien lotus and red dates. After Pao-yue had had a couple of mouthfuls,She Yueeh also brought him a small plateful of brown ginger, preparedaccording to some prescription. Pao-yue put a piece into his mouth, and,impressing some advice on Ch'ing 'Wen, he crossed over to dowager ladyChia's suite of rooms.
His grandmother had not yet got out of bed. But she was well aware thatPao-yue was going out of doors so having the entrance leading into herbedroom opened she asked Pao-yue to walk in. Pao-yue espied behind the oldlady, Pao-ch'in lying with her face turned towards the inside, and notawake yet from her sleep.
Dowager lady Chia observed that Pao-yue was clad in a deep-red feltfringed overcoat, with woollen lichee-coloured archery-sleeves and withan edging of dark green glossy satin, embroidered with gold rings."What!" old lady Chia inquired, "is it snowing?"
"The weather is dull," Pao-yue replied, "but it isn't snowing yet."
Dowager lady Chia thereupon sent for Yuean Yang and told her to fetch thepeacock down pelisse, finished the day before, and give it to him. YueanYang signified her obedience and went off, and actually returned withwhat was wanted.
When Pao-yue came to survey it, he found that the green and golden huesglistened with bright lustre, that the jadelike variegated colours on itshone with splendour, and that it bore no resemblance to the duck-downcoat, which Pao-ch'in had been wearing.
"This," he heard his grandmother smilingly remark, "is called 'birdgold'. This is woven of the down of peacocks, caught in Russia, twistedinto thread. The other day, I presented that one with the wild duck downto your young female cousin, so I now give you this one."
Pao-yue prostrated himself before her, after which he threw the coat overhis shoulders.
"Go and let your mother see it before you start," his grandmotherlaughingly added.
Pao-yue assented, and quitted her apartments, when he caught sight ofYuean Yang standing below rubbing her eyes. Ever since the day on whichYuean Yang had sworn to have done with the match, she had not exchanged asingle word with Pao-yue. Pao-yue was therefore day and night a prey todejection. So when he now observed her shirk his presence again, Pao-yueat once advanced up to her, and, putting on a smile, "My dear girl," hesaid, "do look at the coat I've got on. Is it nice or not?"
Yuean Yang shoved his hand away, and promptly walked into dowager ladyChia's quarters.
Pao-yue was thus compelled to repair to Madame Wang's room, and let hersee his coat. Retracing afterwards his footsteps into the garden, he letCh'ing Wen and She Yueeh also have a look at it, and then came and toldhis grandmother that he had attended to her wishes.
"My mother," he added, "has seen what I've got on. But all she said was:'what a pity!' and then she went on to enjoin me to be 'careful with itand not to spoil it.'"
"There only remains this single one," old lady Chia observed, "so if youspoil it you can't have another. Even did I want to have one made foryou like it now, it would be out of the question."
At the close of these words, she went on to advise him. "Don't," shesaid, "have too much wine and come back early." Pao-yue acquiesced byuttering several yes's.
An old nurse then followed him out into the pavilion. Here theydiscovered six attendants, (that is), Pao-yue's milk-brother Li Kuei, andWang Ho-jung, Chang Jo-chin, Chao I-hua, Ch'ien Ch'i, and Chou Jui, aswell as four young servant-lads: Pei Ming, Pan Ho, Chu Shao and SaoHung; some carrying bundles of clothes on their backs, some holdingcushions in their hands, others leading a white horse with engravedsaddle and variegated bridles. They had already been waiting for a goodlong while. The old nurse went on to issue some directions, and the sixservants, hastily expressing their obedience by numerous yes's, quicklycaught hold of the saddle and weighed the stirrup down while Pao-yuemounted leisurely. Li Kuei and Wang Ho-jung then led the horse by thebit. Two of them, Ch'ien Ch'i and Chou Jui, walked ahead and showed theway. Chang Jo-chin and Chao I-hua followed Pao-yue closely on each side.
"Brother Chou and brother Ch'ien," Pao-yue smiled, from his seat on hishorse, "let's go by this side-gate. It will save my having again todismount, when we reach the entrance to my father's study."
"Mr. Chia Cheng is not in his study," Chou Jui laughed, with a curtsey."It has been daily under lock and key, so there will be no need for you,master, to get down from your horse."
"Though it be locked up," Pao-yue smiled, "I shall have to dismount allthe same."
"You're quite right in what you say, master;" both Ch'ien Ch'i and LiKuei chimed in laughingly; "but pretend you're lazy and don't get down.In the event of our coming across Mr. Lai Ta and our number two Mr. Lin,they're sure, rather awkward though it be for them to say anything totheir master, to tender you one or two words of advice, but throw thewhole of the blame upon us. You can also tell them that we had notexplained to you what was the right thing to do."
Chou Jui and Ch'ien Ch'i accordingly wended their steps straight for theside-gate. But while they were keeping up some sort of conversation,they came face to face with Lai Ta on his way in.
Pao-yue speedily pulled in his horse, with the idea of dismounting. ButLai Ta hastened to draw near and to clasp his leg. Pao-yue stood up onhis stirrup, and, putting on a smile, he took his hand in his, and madeseveral remarks to him.
In quick succession, he also perceived a young servant-lad make hisappearance inside leading the way for twenty or thirty servants, ladenwith brooms and dust-baskets. The moment they espied Pao-yue, they, oneand all, stood along the wall, and dropped their arms against theirsides, with the exception of the head lad, who bending one knee, said:"My obeisance to you, sir."
Pao-yue could not recall to mind his name or surname, but forcing a faintsmile, he nodded his head to and fro. It was only when the horse hadwell gone past, that the lad eventually led the bevy of servants off,and that they went after their business.
Presently, they egressed from the side-gate. Outside, stood theservant-lads of the six domestics, Li Kuei and his companions, as wellas several grooms, who had, from an early hour, got ready about tenhorses and been standing, on special duty, waiting for their arrival. Assoon as they reached the further end of the side-gate, Li Kuei and eachof the other attendants mounted their horses, and pressed ahead to leadthe way. Like a streak of smoke, they got out of sight, without anyoccurrence worth noticing.
Ch'ing Wen, meanwhile, continued to take her medicines. But still sheexperienced no relief in her ailment. Such was the state of exasperationinto which she worked herself that she abused the doctor right and left."All he's good for," she cried, "is to squeeze people's money. But hedoesn't know how to prescribe a single dose of efficacious medicine forhis patients."
"You have far too impatient a disposition!" She Yueeh said, as sheadvised her, with a smile. "'A disease,' the proverb has it, 'comes likea crumbling mountain, and goes like silk that is reeled.' Besides,they're not the divine pills of 'Lao Chuen'. How ever could there be suchefficacious medicines? The only thing for you to do is to quietly lookafter yourself for several days, and you're sure to get all right. Butthe more you work yourself into such a frenzy, the worse you get!"
Ch'ing Weng went on to heap abuse on the head of the young-maids. "Wherehave they gone? Have they bored into the sand?" she ejaculated. "Theysee well enough that I'm ill, so they make bold and runaway. But by andbye when I recover, I shall take one by one of you and flay your skinoff for you."
Ting Erh, a young maid, was struck with dismay, and ran up to her withhasty step. "Miss," she inquired, "what's up with you?"
"Is it likely that the rest are all dead and gone, and that there onlyremains but you?" Ch'ing Wen exclaimed.
But while she spoke, she saw Chui Erh also slowly enter the room.
"Look at this vixen!" Ch'ing Wen shouted. "If I don't ask for her, shewon't come. Had there been any monthly allowances issued and fruitsdistributed here, you would have been the first to run in! But approacha bit! Am I tigress to gobble you up?"
Chui Erh was under the necessity of advancing a few steps nearer to her.But, all of a sudden, Ch'ing Wen stooped forward, and with a dashclutching her hand, she took a long pin from the side of her pillow, andpricked it at random all over.
"What's the use of such paws?" she railed at her. "They don't ply aneedle, and they don't touch any thread! All you're good for is to prigthings to stuff that mouth of yours with! The skin of your phiz isshallow and those paws of yours are light! But with the shame you bringupon yourself before the world, isn't it right that I should prick you,and make mincemeat of you?"
Chui Erh shouted so wildly from pain that She Yueh stepped forward andimmediately drew them apart. She then pressed Ch'ing Wen, until sheinduced her to lie down.
"You're just perspiring," she remarked, "and here you are once more bentupon killing yourself. Wait until you are yourself again! Won't you thenbe able to give her as many blows as you may like? What's the use ofkicking up all this fuss just now?"
Ch'ing Wen bade a servant tell nurse Sung to come in. "Our masterSecundus, Mr. Pao-yue, recently asked me to tell you," she remarked onher arrival, "that Chui Erh is very lazy. He himself gives her orders toher very face, but she is ever ready to raise objections and not tobudge. Even when Hsi Jen bids her do things, she vilifies her behind herback. She must absolutely therefore be packed off to-day. And if Mr. Paohimself lays the matter to-morrow before Madame Wang, things will besquare."
After listening to her grievances, nurse Sung readily concluded in hermind that the affair of the bracelet had come to be known. "What yousuggest is well and good, it's true," she consequently smiled, "but it'sas well to wait until Miss Hua (flower) returns and hears about thethings. We can then give her the sack."
"Mr. Pao-yue urgently enjoined this to-day," Ch'ing Wen pursued, "so whatabout Miss Hua (flower) and Miss Ts'ao (grass)? We've, of course, gobrules of propriety here, so you just do as I tell you; and be quick andsend for some one from her house to come and fetch her away!"
"Well, now let's drop this!" She Yueeh interposed. "Whether she goes soonor whether she goes late is one and the same thing; so let them take heraway soon; we'll then be the sooner clear of her."
At these words, nurse Sung had no alternative but to step out, and tosend for her mother. When she came, she got ready all her effects, andthen came to see Ch'ing Wen and the other girls. "Young ladies," shesaid, "what's up? If your niece doesn't behave as she ought to, why,call her to account. But why banish her from this place? You should,indeed, leave us a little face!"
"As regards what you say," Ch'ing Wen put in, "wait until Pao-yue comes,and then we can ask him. It's nothing to do with us."
The woman gave a sardonic smile. "Have I got the courage to ask him?"she answered. "In what matter doesn't he lend an ear to any settlementyou, young ladies, may propose? He invariably agrees to all you say! Butif you, young ladies, aren't agreeable, it's really of no avail. Whenyou, for example, spoke just now,--it's true it was on the sly,--youcalled him straightway by his name, miss. This thing does very well withyou, young ladies, but were we to do anything of the kind, we'd belooked upon as very savages!"
Ch'ing Wen, upon hearing her remark, became more than ever exasperated,and got crimson in the face. "Yes, I called him by his name," sherejoined, "so you'd better go and report me to our old lady and MadameWang. Tell them I'm a rustic and let them send me too off."
"Sister-in-law," urged She Yueeh, "just you take her away; and if you'vegot aught to say, you can say it by and bye. Is this a place for you tobawl in and to try and explain what is right? Whom have you seendiscourse upon the rules of propriety with us? Not to speak of you,sister-in-law, even Mrs. Lai Ta and Mrs. Lin treat us fairly well. Andas for calling him by name, why, from days of yore to the very present,our dowager mistress has invariably bidden us do so. You yourselves arewell aware of it. So much did she fear that it would be a difficult jobto rear him that she deliberately wrote his infant name on slips ofpaper and had them stuck everywhere and anywhere with the design thatone and all should call him by it. And this in order that it mightexercise a good influence upon his bringing up. Even water-coolies andscavenger-coolies indiscriminately address him by his name; and how muchmore such as we? So late, in fact, as yesterday Mrs. Lin gave him butonce the title of 'Sir,' and our old mistress called even her to task.This is one side of the question. In the next place, we all have to goand make frequent reports to our venerable dowager lady and Madame Wang,and don't we with them allude to him by name in what we have to say? Isit likely we'd also style him 'Sir?' What day is there that we don'tutter the two words 'Pao-yue' two hundred times? And is it for you,sister-in-law, to come and pick out this fault? But in a day or so, whenyou've leisure to go to our old mistress' and Madame Wang's, you'll hearus call him by name in their very presence, and then you'll feelconvinced. You've never, sister-in-law, had occasion to fulfil anyhonourable duties by our old lady and our lady. From one year's end tothe other, all you do is to simply loaf outside the third door. So it'sno matter of surprise, if you don't happen to know anything of thecustoms which prevail with us inside. But this isn't a place where you,sister-in-law, can linger for long. In another moment, there won't beany need for us to say anything; for some one will be coming to ask youwhat you want, and what excuse will you be able to plead? So take heraway and let Mrs. Lin know about it; and commission her to come and findour Mr. Secundus and tell him all. There are in this establishment overa thousand inmates; one comes and another comes, so that though we knowpeople and inquire their names, we can't nevertheless imprint themclearly on our minds."
At the close of this long rigmarole, she at once told a young maid totake the mop and wash the floors.
The woman listened patiently to her arguments, but she could find nowords to say anything to her by way of reply. Nor did she have theaudacity to protract her stay. So flying into a huff, she took Chui Erhalong with her, and there and then made her way out.
"Is it likely," nurse Sung hastily observed, "that a dame like youdoesn't know what manners mean? Your daughter has been in these roomsfor some time, so she should, when she is about to go, knock her headbefore the young ladies. She has no other means of showing hergratitude. Not that they care much about such things. Yet were she tosimply knock her head, she would acquit herself of a duty, if nothingmore. But how is it that she says I'm going, and off she forthwithrushes?"
Chui Erh overheard these words, and felt under the necessity of turningback. Entering therefore the apartment, she prostrated herself beforethe two girls, and then she went in quest of Ch'iu Wen and hercompanions, but neither did they pay any notice whatever to her.
"Hai!" ejaculated the woman, and heaving a sigh--for she did not ventureto utter a word,--she walked off, fostering a grudge in her heart.
Ch'ing Wen had, while suffering from a cold, got into a fit of angerinto the bargain, so instead of being better, she was worse, and shetossed and rolled until the time came for lighting the lamps. But themoment she felt more at ease, she saw Pao-yue come back. As soon as heput his foot inside the door, he gave way to an exclamation, and stampedhis foot.
"What's the reason of such behaviour?" She Yueeh promptly asked him.
"My old grandmother," Pao-yue explained, "was in such capital spiritsthat she gave me this coat to-day; but, who'd have thought it, Iinadvertently burnt part of the back lapel. Fortunately however theevening was advanced so that neither she nor my mother noticed what hadhappened."
Speaking the while, he took it off. She Yueeh, on inspection, foundindeed a hole burnt in it of the size of a finger. "This," she said,"must have been done by some spark from the hand-stove. It's of noconsequence."
Immediately she called a servant to her. "Take this out on the sly," shebade her, "and let an experienced weaver patch it. It will be all rightthen."
So saying, she packed it up in a wrapper, and a nurse carried itoutside.
"It should be ready by daybreak," she urged. "And by no means let ourold lady or Madame Wang know anything about it."
The matron brought it back again, after a protracted absence. "Notonly," she explained; "have weavers, first-class tailors, andembroiderers, but even those, who do women's work, been asked about it,and they all have no idea what this is made of. None of them thereforewill venture to undertake the job."
"What's to be done?" She Yueeh inquired. "But it won't matter if youdon't wear it to-morrow."
"To-morrow is the very day of the anniversary," Pao-yue rejoined."Grandmother and my mother bade me put this on and go and pay my visit;and here I go and burn it, on the first day I wear it. Now isn't thisenough to throw a damper over my good cheer?"
Ch'ing Wen lent an ear to their conversation for a long time, untilunable to restrain herself, she twisted herself round. "Bring it here,"she chimed in, "and let me see it! You haven't been lucky in wearingthis; but never mind!"
These words were still on Ch'ing Wen's lips, when the coat was handed toher. The lamp was likewise moved nearer to her. With minute care shesurveyed it. "This is made," Ch'ing Wen observed, "of gold thread, spunfrom peacock's feathers. So were we now to also take gold thread,twisted from the feathers of the peacock, and darn it closely, byimitating the woof, I think it will pass without detection."
"The peacock-feather-thread is ready at hand," She Yueeh remarkedsmilingly. "But who's there, exclusive of you, able to join thethreads?"
"I'll, needless to say, do my level best to the very cost of my life andfinish," Ch'ing Wen added.
"How ever could this do?" Pao-yue eagerly interposed. "You're justslightly better, and how could you take up any needlework?"
"You needn't go on in this chicken-hearted way!" Ch'ing Wen cried. "Iknow my own self well enough."
With this reply, she sat up, and, putting her hair up, she threwsomething over her shoulders. Her head felt heavy; her body light.Before her eyes, confusedly flitted golden stirs. In real deed, shecould not stand the strain. But when inclined to give up the work, sheagain dreaded that Pao-yue would be driven to despair. She therefore hadperforce to make a supreme effort and, setting her teeth to, she borethe exertion. All the help she asked of She Yueeh was to lend her a handin reeling the thread.
Ch'ing Wen first took hold of a thread, and put it side by side (withthose in the pelisse) to compare the two together. "This," she remarked,"isn't quite like them; but when it's patched up with it, it won't showvery much."
"It will do very well," Pao-yue said. "Could one also go and hunt up aRussian tailor?"
Ch'ing Wen commenced by unstitching the lining, and, inserting under it,a bamboo bow, of the size of the mouth of a tea cup, she bound it tightat the back. She then turned her mind to the four sides of the aperture,and these she loosened by scratching them with a golden knife. Makingnext two stitches across with her needle, she marked out the warp andwoof; and, following the way the threads were joined, she first andforemost connected the foundation, and then keeping to the originallines, she went backwards and forwards mending the hole; passing herwork, after every second stitch, under further review. But she did notply her needle three to five times, before she lay herself down on herpillow, and indulged in a little rest.
Pao-yue was standing by her side. Now he inquired of her: "Whether shewould like a little hot water to drink." Later on, he asked her torepose herself. Now he seized a grey-squirrel wrapper and threw it overher shoulders. Shortly after, he took a pillow and propped her up. (Theway he fussed) so exasperated Ch'ing Wen that she begged and entreatedhim to leave off.
"My junior ancestor!" she exclaimed, "do go to bed and sleep! If you situp for the other half of the night, your eyes will to-morrow look as ifthey had been scooped out, and what good will possibly come out ofthat?"
Pao-yue realised her state of exasperation and felt compelled to come andlie down anyhow. But he could not again close his eyes.
In a little while, she heard the clock strike four, and just managing tofinish she took a small tooth-brush, and rubbed up the pile.
"That will do!" She Yueeh put in. "One couldn't detect it, unless oneexamined it carefully."
Pao-yue asked with alacrity to be allowed to have a look at it. "Really,"he smiled, "it's quite the same thing."
Ch'ing Wen coughed and coughed time after time, so it was only afterextreme difficulty that she succeeded in completing what she had topatch. "It's mended, it's true," she remarked, "but it does not, afterall, look anything like it. Yet, I cannot stand the effort any more!"
As she shouted 'Ai-ya,' she lost control over herself, and dropped downupon the bed.
But, reader, if you choose to know anything more of her state, perusethe next chapter.

CHAPTER LIII.
  In the Ning Kuo mansion sacrifices are offered to their ancestors on      the last night of the year.  In the Jung Kuo mansion, a banquet is given on the evening of the 15th      of the first moon.
But to resume our story. When Pao-yue saw that Ch'ing Wen had in herattempt to finish mending the peacock-down cloak exhausted her strengthand fatigued herself, he hastily bade a young maid help him massage her;and setting to work they tapped her for a while, after which, theyretired to rest. But not much time elapsed before broad daylight set in.He did not however go out of doors, but simply called out that theyshould go at once and ask the doctor round.
Presently, Dr. Wang arrived. After feeling her pulse, his suspicionswere aroused. "Yesterday," he said, "she was much better, so how is itthat to-day she is instead weaker, and has fallen off so much? She mustsurely have had too much in the way of drinking or eating! Or she musthave fatigued herself. A complaint arising from outside sources is,indeed, a light thing. But it's no small matter if one doesn't takeproper care of one's self, as she has done after perspiring."
As he passed these remarks, he walked out of the apartment, and, writinga prescription, he entered again.
When Pao-yue came to examine it, he perceived that he had eliminated thelaxatives, and all the drugs, whose properties were to expel noxiousinfluences, but added pachyma cocos, rhubarb, arolia edulis, and othersuch medicines, which could stimulate the system and strengthen herphysique.
Pao-yue, on one hand, hastened to direct a servant to go and decoct them,and, on the other, he heaved a sigh. "What's to be done?" he exclaimed."Should anything happen to her, it will all be through the evilconsequences of my shortcomings!"
"Hai!" cried Ch'ing Wen, from where she was reclining on her pillow."Dear Mr. Secundus, go and mind your own business! Have I got such adreadful disease?"
Pao-yue had no alternative but to get out of the way. But in theafternoon, he gave out that he was not feeling up to the mark, andhurried back to her side again.
The symptoms of Ch'ing Wen's illness were, it is true, grave; yetfortunately for her she had ever had to strain her physical strength,and not to tax the energies of her mind. Furthermore, she had alwaysbeen frugal in her diet, so that she had never sustained any harm fromunder or over-eating. The custom in the Chia mansion was that as soon asany one, irrespective of masters or servants, contracted the slightestchill or cough, quiet and starving should invariably be the main thingsobserved, the treatment by medicines occupying only a secondary place.Hence it was that when the other day she unawares felt unwell, she atonce abstained from food during two or three days, while she carefullyalso nursed herself by taking proper medicines. And although sherecently taxed her strength a little too much, she gradually succeeded,by attending with extra care to her health for another few days, inbringing about her complete recovery.
Of late, his female cousins, who lived in the garden, had been havingtheir meals in their rooms, so with the extreme convenience of having afire to prepare drinks and eatables, Pao-yue himself was able, needlessfor us to go into details, to ask for soups and order broths for (Ch'ingWen), with which to recoup her health.
Hsi Jen returned soon after she had followed the funeral of her mother.She Yueeh then minutely told Hsi Jen all about Chui Erh's affair, aboutCh'ing Wen having sent her off, and about Pao-yue having been alreadyinformed of the fact, and so forth, yet to all this Hsi Jen made nofurther comment than: "what a very hasty disposition (that girl Ch'ingWen has!)."
But consequent upon Li Wan being likewise laid up with a cold, she gotthrough the inclemency of the weather; Madame Hsing suffering so muchfrom sore eyes that Ying Ch'un and Chou-yen had to go morning andevening and wait on her, while she used such medicines as she had; LiWan's brother, having also taken her sister-in-law Li, together with LiWen and Li Ch'i, to spend a few days at his home, and Pao-yue seeing, onone hand, Hsi Jen brood without intermission over the memory of hermother, and give way to secret grief, and Ch'ing Wen, on the other,continue not quite convalescent, there was no one to turn any attentionto such things as poetical meetings, with the result that severaloccasions, on which they were to have assembled, were passed overwithout anything being done. By this time, the twelfth moon arrived. Theend of the year was nigh at hand, so Madame Wang and lady Feng wereengaged in making the necessary annual preparations. But, withoutalluding to Wang Tzu-t'eng, who was promoted to be Lord HighCommissioner of the Nine Provinces; Chia Yue-ts'un, who filled up thepost of Chief Inspector of Cavalry, Assistant Grand Councillor, andCommissioner of Affairs of State, we will resume our narrative with ChiaChen, in the other part of the establishment. After having the AncestralHall thrown open, he gave orders to the domestics to sweep the place, toget ready the various articles, and bring over the ancestral tablets.Then he had the upper rooms cleaned, so as to be ready to receive thevarious images that were to be hung about. In the two mansions of Ningand Jung, inside as well as outside, above as well as below, everythingwas, therefore, bustle and confusion. As soon as Mrs. Yu, of the Ningmansion, put her foot out of bed on this day, she set to work, with theassistance of Chia Jung's wife, to prepare such needlework and presentsas had to be sent over to dowager lady Chia's portion of theestablishment, when it so happened that a servant-girl broke in uponthem with a tea-tray in hand, containing ingots of silver of the kindgiven the evening before new year.
"Hsing Erh," she said, "informs your ladyship that the pieces of gold inthat bundle of the other day amount in all to one hundred andfifty-three taels, one mace and seven candareens; and that the ingots ofpure metal and those not, contained in here, number all together twohundred and twenty."
With these words, she presented the tray. Mrs. Yu passed the ingotsunder survey. She found some resembling plum-blossom; others peonies.Among them were some with pens and 'as you like,' (importing "yourwishes are bound to be fulfilled);" and others representing the eightprecious things linked together, for use in spring-time.
Mrs. Yu directed that the silver ingots should be made up into a parcel,and then she bade Hsing Erh take them and deliver them immediatelyinside.
The servant-girl signified her obedience, and went away. But shortlyChia Chen arrived for his meal, and Chia Jung's wife withdrew.
"Have we received," thereupon inquired Chia Chen, "the bounty conferred(by His Majesty) for our spring sacrifices or not?"
"I've sent Jung Erh to-day to go and receive it," Mrs. Yu rejoined.
"Albeit," continued Chia Chen, "our family can well do without thosepaltry taels, yet they are, whatever their amount may be, an imperialgift to us so take them over as soon as you can, and send them to ourold lady, on the other side, to get ready the sacrifices to ourancestors. Above, we shall then receive the Emperor's bounty; below, weshall enjoy the goodwill of our progenitors. For no matter if we went sofar as to spend ten thousand ounces of silver to present offerings toour forefathers with, they could not, in the long run, come up this giftin high repute. Added to this, we shall be the participators of graceand the recipients of blessings. Putting one or two households such asour own aside, what resources would those poverty-stricken families ofhereditary officials have at their command wherewith to offer theirsacrifices and celebrate the new year, if they could not rely upon thismoney? In very truth, therefore, the imperial favour is vast, andallproviding!"
"Your arguments are quite correct!" Mrs. Yu ventured.
But while these two were indulging in this colloquy, they caught sightof a messenger, who came and announced: "Our young master has arrived."
Chia Chen accordingly enjoined that he should be told to enter;whereupon they saw Chia Jung step into the room and present with bothhands a small bag made of yellow cloth.
"How is it you've been away the whole day?" Chia Chen asked.
Chia Jung strained a smile. "I didn't receive the money to-day from theBoard of Rites," he replied. "The issue was again made at the treasuryof the Kuang Lu temple; so I had once more to trudge away to the KuangLu temple before I could get it. The various officials in the Kuang Lutemple bade me present their compliments to you, father. (They asked meto tell you) that they had not seen you for many days, and that they arereally longing for your company."
"What an idea! Do they care to see me?" Chia Chen laughed. "Why, here'sthe end of the year drawing nigh again; so if they don't hanker after mypresents, they must long and crave for my entertainments."
While he spoke his eye espied a slip of paper affixed to the yellowcloth bag, bearing the four large characters, 'the imperial favour iseverlasting.' On the other side figured also a row of small characterswith the seal of the Director of Ancestral Worship in the Board ofRites. These testified that the enclosed consisted of two shares,conferred upon the Ning Kuo duke, Chia Yen, and the Jung Kuo duke, ChiaFa, as a bounty (from the Emperor), for sacrifices to them every springin perpetuity, (and gave) the number of taels, computed in pure silver,and the year, moon and day, on which they were received in open hall byChia Jung, Controller in the Imperial Prohibited City and ExpectantOfficer of the Guards. The signature of the official in charge of thetemple for that year was appended below in purple ink.
After Chia Chen had perused the inscription, he finished his meal,rinsed his mouth and washed his hands. This over, he changed his shoesand hat, and bidding Chia Jung follow him along with the money, he wentand informed dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang (of the receipt of theimperial bounty), and repairing back to the near side, he communicatedthe fact to Chia She and Madame Hsing; after which, he, at length,betook himself to his quarters. He then emptied the money and gaveorders that the bag should be taken and burnt in the large censer in theAncestral Hall.
"Go and ask your aunt Tertia, yonder," he further enjoined Chia Jung,"whether the day on which the new year wine is to be drunk has beenfixed or not? If it has been determined upon, timely notice should begiven in the library to draw out a proper list in order that when weagain issue our invitations, there should be no chance of twoentertainments coming off on the same day. Last year, not sufficientcare was exercised, and several persons were invited to both mansions onthe very same occasion. And people didn't say that we hadn't beencareful enough, but that, as far as appearances went, the two householdshad made up their minds among themselves to show an empty attention,prompted by the fear of trouble."
Chia Jung immediately replied that he would attend to his injunctions,and not much time elapsed before he brought a list mentioning the dayson which the inmates were to be invited to partake of the new year wine.
Chia Chen examined it. "Go," he then said, "and give it to Lai Sheng sothat he may see its contents and invite the guests. But mind he doesn'tfix anything else for the dates specified in here."
But while watching from the pavilion the servant-boys carrying theenclosing screens and rubbing the tables and the gold and silversacrificial utensils, he perceived a lad appear on the scene holding apetition and a list, and report that 'Wu, the head-farmer in the HeiShan village, had arrived.' "What does this old executioner come forto-day?" Chia Chen exclaimed.
Chia Jung took the petition and the list, and, unfolding them with alldespatch, he held them up (to his father). Chia Chen however glanced atthe papers, as they were held by Chia Jung, keeping the while both handsbehind his back. The petition on red paper ran as follows: "Yourservant, the head farmer, Wu Chin-hsiao, prostrates himself before hismaster and mistress and wishes them every kind of happiness and goodhealth, as well as good health to their worthy scion and daughter. Maygreat joy, great blessings, brilliant honours and peace be their sharein this spring, which is about to dawn! May official promotion andincrease of emoluments be their lot! May they see in everything theaccomplishment of their wishes."
Chia Chen smiled. "For a farmer," he remarked, "it has several goodpoints!"
"Pay no heed to the style," urged Chia Jung, also smiling; "but to thegood wishes."
Saying this, he speedily opened the list. The articles mentioned were,on examination, found to consist of: "Thirty big deer; five thousandmusk deer; fifty roebuck deer; twenty Siamese pigs; twenty boiled pigs;twenty 'dragon' pigs; twenty wild pigs; twenty home-salted pigs; twentywild sheep; twenty grey sheep; twenty home-boiled sheep; twentyhome-dried sheep; two hundred sturgeon; two hundred catties of mixedfish; live chickens, ducks and geese, two hundred of each; two hundreddried chickens, ducks and geese; two hundred pair of pheasants andhares; two hundred pair of bears' paws; twenty catties of deer tendons;fifty catties of beche-de-mer; fifty deer tongues; fifty ox tongues;twenty catties of dried clams; filberts, fir-cones, peaches, apricotsand squash, two hundred bags of each; fifty pair of salt prawns; twohundred catties of dried shrimps; a thousand catties of superfine,picked charcoal; two thousand catties of medium charcoal; twentythousand catties of common charcoal; two piculs of red rice, grown inthe imperial grounds; fifty bushels of greenish, glutinous rice; fiftybushels of white glutinous rice; fifty bushels of pounded non-glutinousrice; fifty bushels of various kinds of corn and millet; a thousandpiculs of ordinary common rice. Exclusive of a cartload of every sort ofvegetables, and irrespective of two thousand five hundred taels, derivedfrom the sale of corn and millet and every kind of domestic animals,your servant respectfully presents, for your honour's delectation, twopair of live deer, four pair of white rabbits, four pair of blackrabbits, two pair of live variegated fowls, and two pair of duck, fromwestern countries."
When Chia Chen had exhausted the list, "Bring him in!" he cried. In alittle time, he perceived Wu Chin-hsiao make his appearance inside. Butsimply halting in the court, he bumped his head on the ground and paidhis respects.
Chia Chen desired a servant to raise him up. "You're still so hale!" hesmiled.
"I don't deceive you, Sir," Wu Chin-hsiao observed, "when I say thatyours servants are so accustomed to walking, that had we not come, wewouldn't have felt exceedingly dull. Isn't the whole crowd of them keenupon coming to see what the world is like at the feet of the son ofheaven? Yet they're, after all, so young in years, that there's the fearof their going astray on the way. But, in a few more years, I shall beable to appease my solicitude on their account."
"How many days have you been on the way?" Chia Chen inquired.
"To reply to your question, Sir," Wu Chin-hsiao ventured, "so much snowhas fallen this year that it's everywhere out of town four and five feetin depth. The other day, the weather suddenly turned mild, and with thethaw that set in, it became so very hard to make any progress that wewasted several days. Yet albeit we've been a month and two days inaccomplishing the journey; it isn't anything excessive. But as I fearedlest you, Sir, would be giving way to anxiety, didn't I hurry along toarrive in good time?"
"How is it, I said, that he's come only to-day!" Chia Chen observed.
"But upon looking over the list just now it seemed to me that you, oldfossil, had come again to make as much as fun of me, as if you wereputting up a stage for a boxing-match."
Wu Chin-hsiao hastily drew near a couple of steps. "I must tell you,Sir," he remarked, "that the harvest this year hasn't really been good.Rain set in ever since the third moon, and there it went on incessantlystraight up to the eighth moon. Indeed, the weather hasn't kept fine forfive or six consecutive days. In the ninth moon, there came a storm ofhail, each stone of which was about the size of a saucer. And over anarea of the neighbouring two or three hundred li, the men and houses,animals and crops, which sustained injury, numbered over thousands andten thousands. Hence it is that the things we've brought now are whatthey are. Your servant would not have the audacity to tell a lie."
Chia Chen knitted his eyebrows. "I had computed," he said, "that thevery least you would have brought would have been five thousand taels.What's this enough for? There are only now eight or nine of you farmers,and from two localities reports have contrariwise reached us during thecourse of this very year of the occurrence of droughts; and do youpeople come again to try your larks with us? Why, verily these aren'tsufficient to see the new year in with."
"And yet," Wu Chin-hsiao argued, "your place can be looked upon ashaving fared well; for my brother, who's only over a hundred li awayfrom where I am, has actually fallen in with a vastly different lot! Hehas at present eight farms of that mansion under his control, and theseconsiderably larger than those of yours, Sir; and yet this year they toohave only produced but a few things. So nothing beyond two or threethousand taels has been realised. What's more, they've had to borrowmoney."
"Quite so!" Chia Chen exclaimed. "The state of things in my place hereis passable. I've got no outside outlay. The main thing I have to mindis to make provision for a year's necessary expenses. If I launch outinto luxuries, I have to suffer hardships, so I must try a littleself-denial and manage to save something. It's the custom, besides, atthe end of the year to send presents to people and invite others; butI'll thicken the skin of my face a bit, (and dispense with both), andhave done. I'm not like the inmates in that mansion, who have, duringthe last few years, added so many items of expenditure, that it's, ofcourse, a matter of impossibility for them to avoid loosening theirpurse strings. But they haven't, on the other hand, made any addition totheir funds and landed property. During the course of the past year ortwo, they've had to make up many deficits. And if they don't appeal toyou, to whom can they go?"
Wu Chin-hsiao laughed. "It's true," he said, "that in that mansion manyitems have been added, but money goes out and money comes in. And won'tthe Empress and His Majesty the Emperor bestow their favour?"
At these words, Chia Chen smilingly faced Chia Jung and the otherinmates. "Just you listen to his arguments!" he exclaimed. "Aren't theyridiculous, eh?"
Chia Jung and the rest promptly smiled. "Among your hills and seaboardcan anything," they observed, "be known with regard to this principle?Is it likely, pray, that the Empress will ever make over to us theEmperor's treasury? Why, even supposing she may at heart entertain anysuch wish, she herself cannot possibly adopt independent action. Ofcourse, she does confer her benefits on them, but this is at statedtimes and fixed periods, and they merely consist of a few colouredsatins, antiquities, and bric-a-brac. In fact, when she does bestow hardcash on them, it doesn't exceed a hundred ounces of silver. But did sheeven give them so much as a thousand and more taels, what would thesesuffice for? During which of the two last years have they not had tofork out several thousands of taels? In the first year, the imperialconsort paid a visit to her parents; and just calculate how much theymust have run through in laying out that park, and you'll then know howthey stand! Why, if in another couple of years, the Empress comes andpays them a second visit, they'll be, I'm inclined to fancy, regularpaupers."
"That's why," urged Chia Chen smiling, "country people are suchunsophisticated creatures, that though they behold what lies on thesurface, they have no idea of what is inside hidden from view. They'rejust like a piece of yellow cedar made into a mallet for beating thesonorous stones with. The exterior looks well enough; but it's allbitter inside."
"In very truth," Chia Jung added, laughing also the while, as headdressed himself to Chia Chen, "that mansion is impoverished. The otherday, I heard a consultation held on the sly between aunt Secunda andYuean Yang. What they wanted was to filch our worthy senior's things andgo and pawn them in order to raise money."
"This is just another devilish trick of that minx Feng!" Chia Chensmiled. "How ever could they have reached such straits? She's certain tohave seen that expenses were great, and that heavy deficits had to besquared, so wishing again to curtail some item or other, who knowswhich, she devised this plan as a preparatory step, in order that whenit came to be generally known, people should say that they had beenreduced to such poverty. But from the result of the calculations I havearrived at in my mind, things haven't as yet attained this climax:"
Continuing, he issued orders to a servant to take Wu Chin-hsiao outside,and to treat him with every consideration. But no further mention needbe made of him.
During this while, Chia Chen gave directions to keep from the variousperquisites just received such as would prove serviceable for thesacrifices to their ancestors, and, selecting a few things of each kind,he told Chia Jung to have them taken to the Jung mansion. After this, hehimself kept what was required for his own use at home; and thenallotting the rest, with due compliance to gradation, he had share aftershare piled up at the foot of the moon-shaped platform, and sendingservants to summon the young men of the clan, he distributed them amongthem.
In quick succession, numerous contributions for the ancestral sacrificeswere likewise sent from the Jung mansion; also presents for Chia Chen.Chia Chen inspected the things, and having them removed, he completedpreparing the sacrificial utensils. Then putting on a pair of slip-shodshoes and throwing over his shoulders a long pelisse with 'She-li-sun'fur, he bade the servants spread a large wolf-skin rug in a sunny placeon the stone steps below the pillars of the pavilion, and with his backto the warm sun, he leisurely watched the young people come and receivethe new year gifts. Perceiving that Chia Ch'in had also come to fetchhis share, Chia Chen called him over. "How is it that you've come too?"he asked. "Who told you to come?"
Chia Ch'in respectfully dropped his arms against his sides. "I heard,"he replied, "that you, senior Sir, had sent for us to appear before youhere and receive our presents; so I didn't wait for the servants to goand tell me, but came straightway."
"These things," Chia Chen added, "are intended for distribution amongall those uncles and cousins who have nothing to do and who enjoy nosource of income. Those two years you had no work, I gave you plenty ofthings too. But you're entrusted at present with some charge in theother mansion, and you exercise in the family temples control over thebonzes and taoist priests, so that you as well derive every month yourshare of an allowance. Irrespective of that, the allowances and money ofthe Buddhist priests pass through your hands. And do you still come tofetch things of this kind? You're far too greedy. Just you look at thefineries you wear. Why, they look like the habiliments of one who hasmoney to spend, of a regular man of business. You said some time backthat you had nothing which could bring you in any money, but how is itthat you've got none again now? You really don't look as if you were inthe same plight that you were in once upon a time."
"I have in my home a goodly number of inmates," Chia Ch'in explained,"so my expenses are great."
Chia Chen gave a saturnine laugh. "Are you trying again to excuseyourself with me?" he cried. "Do you flatter yourself that I have noidea of your doings in the family temples? When you get there, you, ofcourse, play the grand personnage and no one has the courage to runcounter to your wishes. Then you've also got the handling of money.Besides you're far away from us, so you're arrogant and audacious. Nightafter night, you get bad characters together; you gamble for money; andyou keep women and young boys. And though you now fling away money withsuch a high hand, do you still presume to come and receive gifts? But asyou can't manage to filch anything to take along with you, it will doyou good to get beans, with the pole used for carrying water. Wait untilthe new year is over, and then I'll certainly report you to your uncleSecundus."
Chia Ch'in got crimson in the face, and did not venture to utter asingle word by way of extenuation. A servant, however, then announcedthat the Prince from the Pei mansion had sent a pair of scrolls and apurse.
At this announcement, Chia Chen immediately told Chia Jung to go out andentertain the messengers. "And just say," he added, "that I'm not athome."
Chia Jung went on his way. Chia Chen, meanwhile, dismissed Chia Ch'in;and, seeing the things taken away, he returned to his quarters andfinished his evening meal with Mrs. Yu. But nothing of any note occurredduring that night.
The next day, he had, needless to say, still more things to give hismind to. Soon arrived the twenty ninth day of the twelfth moon, andeverything was in perfect readiness. In the two mansions alike, the gateguardian gods and scrolls were renovated. The hanging tablets were newlyvarnished. The peach charms glistened like new. In the Ning Kuo mansion,every principal door, starting from the main entrance, the ceremonialgates, the doors of the large pavilions, of the winter apartments, andinner pavilions, the inner three gates, the inner ceremonial gates andthe inner boundary gates, straight up to the doors of the main halls,was flung wide open. At the bottom of the steps, were placed on eitherside large and lofty vermilion candles, of uniform colour; which whenlit presented the appearance of a pair of golden dragons.
On the morrow, dowager lady Chia and those with any official status,donned the court dress consistent with their grade, and taking first andforemost a retinue of inmates with them, they entered the palace ineight bearer state chairs, and presented their congratulations. Afteracquitting themselves of the ceremonial rites, and partaking of abanquet, they betook themselves back, and alighted from their chairs ontheir arrival at the winter hall of the Ning mansion. The young men, whohad not followed the party to court, waited, arranged in their properorder, in front of the entrance the King mansion, and subsequently ledthe way into the ancestral temple.
But to return to Pao-ch'in. This was the first occasion, on which sheput her foot inside to look at the inner precincts of the Chia ancestraltemple, and as she did so, she scrutinized with minute attention all thedetails that met her gaze in the halls dedicated to their forefathers.These consisted, in fact, of a distinct courtyard on the west side ofthe Ning mansion. Within the balustrade, painted black, stood fiveapartments. Over the main entrance to these was suspended a flat tabletwith the inscription in four characters: 'Ancestral hall of the Chiafamily.' On the side of these was recorded the fact that it had been thehandiwork of Wang Hsi-feng, specially promoted to the rank of GrandTutor of the Heir Apparent, and formerly Chancellor of the ImperialAcademy. On either side, was one of a pair of scrolls, bearing themotto:
  Besmear the earth with your liver and brains, all ye people, out of      gratitude for the bounty of (the Emperor's) protection!  The reputation (of the Chia family) reaches the very skies. Hundred      generations rejoice in the splendour of the sacrifices accorded      them.
This too had been executed by Wang, the Grand Tutor.
As soon as the court was entered, a raised road was reached, paved withwhite marble, on both sides of which were planted deep green fir trees,and kingfisher-green cypress trees. On the moon-shaped platform werelaid out antiquities, tripods, libation-vases, and other similararticles. In front of the antechamber was hung a gold-coloured flattablet, with nine dragons, and the device:
  Like a dazzling star is the statesman, who assists the Emperor.
This was the autograph of a former Emperor.
On both sides figured a pair of antithetical scrolls, with the motto:
  Their honours equal the sun and moon in lustre.  Their fame is without bounds. It descends to their sons and grandsons.
These lines were likewise from the imperial pencil. Over the five-roomedmain hall was suspended a tablet, inlaid with green, representingwriggling dragons. The sentiments consisted of:
  Mindful of the remotest and heedful of the most distant ancestors.
A pair of antithetical scrolls was hung on the sides; on which waswritten:
  After their death, their sons and grandsons enjoy their beneficent      virtues.  Up to the very present the masses think of the Jung and Ning families.
Both these mottoes owed their origin to the imperial pencil.
Inside, lanterns and candles burnt with resplendent brightness.Embroidered curtains and decorated screens were hung in such profusionthat though a large number of ancestral tablets were placed about theycould not be clearly discerned. The main thing that struck the eye wasthe inmates of the Chia mansion standing about, on the left and right,disposed in their proper order. Chia Ching was overseer of thesacrifices. Chia She played the part of assistant. Chia Chen presentedthe cups for libations. Chia Lien and Chia Tsung offered up the stripsof paper. Pao-yue held the incense. Chia Ch'ang and Chia Ling distributedthe hassocks and looked after the receptacles for the ashes ofjoss-sticks. The black clad musicians discoursed music. Thelibation-cups were offered thrice in sacrifice. These devotions over,paper money was burnt; and libations of wine were poured. After theobservance of the prescribed rites, the band stopped, and withdrew. Thewhole company then pressed round dowager lady Chia, and repaired to themain hall, where the images were placed. The embroidered curtains werehung high up. The variegated screens shut in the place from view. Thefragrant candles burnt with splendour. In the place of honour, of themain apartment, were suspended the portraits of two progenitors of theNing and Jung, both of whom were attired in costumes, ornamented withdragons, and clasped with belts of jade. On the right and left of them,were also arrayed the likenesses of a number of eminent ancestors.
Chia Heng, Chia Chih and the others of the same status stood accordingto their proper grades in a row extending from the inner ceremonial gatestraight up to the verandah of the main hall. Outside the balustradecame at last Chia Ching and Chia She. Inside the balustrade figured thevarious female members of the family. The domestics and pages werearrayed beyond the ceremonial gate. As each set of eatables arrived,they transmitted them as far as the ceremonial gate, where Chia Heng,Chia Chih and his companions were ready to receive them. From one toanother, they afterwards reached the bottom of the steps and found theirway into Chia Ching's hands.
Chia Jung, being the eldest grandson of the senior branch, was the onlyperson, who penetrated within the precincts of the balustrade reservedfor the female inmates. So whenever Chia Ching had any offerings to passon, he delivered them to Chia Jung, and Chia Jung gave them to his wife;who again handed them to lady Feng, Mrs. Yu, and the several ladies. Andwhen these offerings reached the sacrificial altar, they were at lengthsurrendered to Madame Wang. Madame Wang thereupon placed them in dowagerlady Chia's hands, and old lady Chia deposited them on the altar.
Madame Hsing stood on the west-east side of the sacrificial altar, andalong with old lady Chia, she offered the oblations and laid them intheir proper places. After the vegetables, rice, soup, sweets, wine andtea had been handed up, Chia Jung eventually retired outside and resumedhis position above Chia Ch'in.
Of the male inmates, whose names were composed with the radical 'wen,''literature,' Chia Ching was at the time the head. Below followed thosewith the radical 'Yue,' 'gem,' led by Chia Chen. Next to these, came theinmates with the radical 'ts'ao,' 'grass,' headed by Chia Jung. Thesewere arranged in proper order, with due regard to left and right. Themen figured on the east; the women on the west.
When dowager lady Chia picked up a joss-stick and prostrated herself toperform her devotions, one and all fell simultaneously on their knees,packing up the five-roomed principal pavilion, the inside as well asoutside of the three antechambers, the verandahs, the top and bottom ofthe stairs, the interior of the two vermilion avenues so closely withall their fineries and embroideries that not the slightest spaceremained vacant among them. Not so much as the caw of a crow struck theear. All that was audible was the report of jingling and tinkling, andthe sound of the gold bells and jade ornaments slightly rocked to andfro. Besides these, the creaking noise made by the shoes of the inmates,while getting up and kneeling down.
In a little time, the ceremonies were brought to a close. Chia Ching,Chia She and the rest hastily retired and adjourned to the Jung mansion,where they waited with the special purpose of paying their obeisance todowager lady Chia.
Mrs. Yu's drawing rooms were entirely covered with red carpets. In thecentre stood a large gold cloisonne brasier, with three legs, inimitation of rhinoceros tusks, washed with gold. On the stove-couch inthe upper part was laid a new small red hair rug. On it were placed deepred back-cushions with embroidered representations of dragons, whichwere embedded among clouds and clasped the character longevity, as wellas reclining-pillows and sitting-rugs. Covers made of black fox skinwere moreover thrown over the couch, along with skins of pure white foxfor sitting-cushions.
Dowager lady Chia was invited to place herself on the couch; and on theskin-rugs spread, on either side, two or three of the sisters-in-law, ofthe same standing as old lady Chia, were urged to sit down.
After the necessary arrangements had been concluded, skin rugs were alsoput on the small couch, erected in a horizontal position on the nearportion of the apartments, and Madame Hsing and the other ladies of herage were motioned to seat themselves. On the two sides stood, face toface on the floor, twelve chairs carved and lacquered, over which werethrown antimacassars and small grey-squirrel rugs, of uniform colour. Atthe foot of each chair was a large copper foot-stove. On these chairs,Pao-ch'in and the other young ladies were asked to sit down.
Mrs. Yu took a tray and with her own hands she presented tea to old ladyChia. Chia Jung's wife served the rest of their seniors. Subsequently,Mrs. Yu helped Madame Hsing too and her contemporaries; and Chia Jung'swife then gave tea to the various young ladies; while lady Feng, Li Wanand a few others simply remained below, ready to minister to theirwants. After their tea, Madame Hsing and her compeers were the first torise and come and wait on dowager lady Chia, while she had hers. Dowagerlady Chia chatted for a time with her old sisters-in-law and thendesired the servants to look to her chair.
Lady Feng thereupon speedily walked up and supported her to rise to herfeet.
"The evening meal has long ago been got ready for you, venerableancestor," Mrs. Yu smiled. "You've year by year shown no desire tohonour us with your presence, but tarry a bit on this occasion andpartake of some refreshment before you cross over. Is it likely, infact, that we can't come up to that girl Feng?"
"Go on, worthy senior!" laughed lady Feng, as she propped old lady Chia."Let's go home and eat our own. Don't heed what she says!"
"In what bustle and confusion aren't you in over here," smiled dowagerlady Chia, "with all the sacrifices to our ancestors, and how could youstand all the trouble I'm putting you to? I've never, furthermore, hadevery year anything to eat with you; but you've always been in the wayof sending me things. So isn't it as well that you should again let mehave a few? And as I'll keep for the next day what I shan't be able toget through, won't I thus have a good deal more?"
This remark evoked general laughter.
"Whatever you do," she went on to enjoin her, "mind you depute somereliable persons to sit up at night and look after the incense fires;but they mustn't let their wits go wool-gathering."
Mrs. Yu gave her to understand that she would see to it, and theysallied out, at the same time, into the fore part of thewinter-apartments. And when Mrs. Yu and her friends went past thescreen, the pages introduced the bearers, who shouldered the sedan andwalked out by the main entrance. Then following too in the track ofMadame Hsing and the other ladies, Mrs. Yu repaired in their companyinto the Jung mansion.
(Dowager lady Chia's) chair had, meanwhile, got beyond the principalgateway. Here again were deployed, on the east side of the street, thebearers of insignia, the retinue and musicians of the duke of Ning Kuo.They crammed the whole extent of the street. Comers and goers were alikekept back. No thoroughfare was allowed. Shortly, the Jung mansion wasreached. The large gates and main entrances were also thrown openstraight up to the very interior of the compound. On the presentoccasion, however, the bearers did not put the chair down by the winterquarters, but passing the main hall, and turning to the west, theyrested it on their arrival at the near side of dowager lady Chia'sprincipal pavilion. The various attendants pressed round old lady Chiaand followed her into her main apartment, where decorated mats andembroidered screens had also been placed about, and everything looked asif brand-new.
In the brasier, deposited in the centre of the room, burnt fir and cedarincense, and a hundred mixed herbs. The moment dowager lady Chiaensconced herself into a seat, an old nurse entered and announced that:"the senior ladies had come to pay their respects."
Old lady Chia rose with alacrity to her feet to go and greet them, whenshe perceived that two or three of her old sisters-in-law had alreadystepped inside, so clasping each other's hands, they now laughed, andnow they pressed each other to sit down. After tea, they took theirdeparture; but dowager lady Chia only escorted them as far as the innerceremonial gate, and retracing her footsteps, she came and resumed theplace of honour. Chia Ching, Chia She and the other seniors then usheredthe various junior male members of the household into her apartments.
"I put you," smiled old lady Chia, "to ever so much trouble andinconvenience from one year's end to another; so don't pay anyobeisance."
But while she spoke, the men formed themselves into one company, and thewomen into another, and performed their homage, group by group. Thisover, arm-chairs were arranged on the left and on the right; and onthese chairs they too subsequently seated themselves, according to theirseniority and gradation, to receive salutations. The men and womenservants, and the pages and maids employed in the two mansions thenpaid, in like manner, the obeisance consonant with their positions,whether high, middle or low; and this ceremony observed, the new yearmoney was distributed, together with purses, gold and silver ingots, andother presents of the same description. A 'rejoicing together' banquetwas spread. The men sat on the east; the women on the west. 'T'u Su,'new year's day, wine was served; also 'rejoicing together' soup,'propitious' fruits, and 'as you like' cakes. At the close of thebanquet, dowager lady Chia rose and penetrated into the inner chamberwith the purpose of effecting a change in her costume, so the severalinmates present could at last disperse and go their own way.
That night, incense was burnt and offerings presented at the variousaltars to Buddha and the kitchen god. In the courtyard of Madame Wang'smain quarters paper horses and incense for sacrifices to heaven andearth were all ready. At the principal entrance of the garden of BroadVista were suspended horn lanterns, which from their lofty places casttheir bright rays on either side. Every place was hung with streetlanterns. Every inmate, whether high or low, was got up in gala dress.Throughout the whole night, human voices resounded confusedly. The dinof talking and laughing filled the air. Strings of crackers and rocketswere let off incessantly.
The morrow came. At the fifth watch, dowager lady Chia and the othersenior members of the family donned the grand costumes, which accordedwith their status, and with a complete retinue they entered the palaceto present their court congratulations; for that day was, in addition,the anniversary of Yuean Ch'un's birth. After they had regaled themselvesat a collation, they wended their way back, and betaking themselves alsointo the Ning mansion, they offered their oblations to their ancestors,and then returned home and received the conventional salutations, afterwhich they put off their fineries and retired to rest.
None of the relatives and friends, who came to wish their compliments ofthe season, were admitted into (old lady Chia's) presence, but simplyhad a friendly chat with Mrs. Hsueeh and 'sister-in-law' Li, and studiedtheir own convenience. Or along with Pao-yue, Pao-ch'ai and the otheryoung ladies, they amused themselves by playing the game of war ordominoes.
Madame Wang and lady Feng had one day after another their hands fullwith the invitations they had to issue for the new year wine. In thehalls and courts of the other side theatricals and banquets succeededeach other and relations and friends dropped in in an incessant string.Bustle reigned for seven or eight consecutive days, before thingssettled down again.
But presently the festival of the full moon of the first month drewnear, and both mansions, the Ning as well as the Jung, were everywhereornamented with lanterns and decorations. On the eleventh, Chia Sheinvited dowager lady Chia and the other inmates. On the next day, ChiaChen also entertained his old senior and Madame Wang and lady Feng. Butfor us to record on how many consecutive days invitations were extendedto them to go and, drink the new year wine, would be an impossible task.
The fifteenth came. On this evening dowager lady Chia gave orders tohave several banqueting tables laid in the main reception hall, toengage a company of young actors, to have every place illuminated withflowered lanterns of various colours, and to assemble at a familyentertainment all the sons, nephews, nieces, grandchildren andgrandchildren's wives and other members of the two mansions of Ning andJung. As however Chia Ching did not habitually have any wine or take anyordinary food, no one went to press him to come.
On the seventeenth, he hastened, at the close of the ancestralsacrifices, out of town to chasten himself. In fact, even during the fewdays he spent at home, he merely frequented retired rooms and lonelyplaces, and did not take the least interest in any single concern. Buthe need not detain us any further.
As for Chia She, after he had received dowager lady Chia's presents, hesaid good-bye and went away. But old lady Chia herself was perfectlyaware that she could not conveniently tarry any longer on this side soshe too followed his example and took her departure.
When Chia She got home, he along with all the guests feasted his eyes onthe illuminations and drank wine with them, Music and singing deafenedthe ear. Embroidered fineries were everywhere visible. For his way ofseeking amusement was unlike that customary in this portion of theestablishment.
In dowager lady Chia's reception hall, ten tables were meanwhilearranged. By each table was placed a teapoy. On these teapoys stoodcensers and bottles; three things in all. (In the censers) was burnt'Pai ho' palace incense, a gift from his Majesty the Emperor. But smallpots, about eight inches long, four to five inches broad and two orthree inches high, adorned with scenery in the shape of rockeries, werealso placed about. All of which contained fresh flowers. Small foreignlacquer trays were likewise to be seen, laden with diminutive paintedtea-cups of antique ware. Transparent gauze screens with frames ofcarved blackwood, ornamented with a fringe representing flowers andgiving the text of verses, figured too here and there. In differentkinds of small old vases were combined together the three friends ofwinter (pine, bamboo and plum,) as well as 'jade-hall,' 'happiness andhonour,' and other fresh flowers.
At the upper two tables sat 'sister-in-law' Li and Mrs. Hsueeh. On theeast was only laid a single table. But there as well were placed carvedscreens, covered with dragons, and a short low-footed couch, with a fullassortment of back-cushions, reclining-cushions and skin-rugs. On thecouch stood a small teapoy, light and handy, of foreign lacquer, inlaidwith gold. On the teapoy were arrayed cups, bowls, foreign cloth napkinsand such things. But on it spectacle case was also conspicuous.
Dowager lady Chia was reposing on the couch. At one time, she chattedand laughed with the whole company; at another, she took up herspectacles and looked at what was going on on the stage.
"Make allowances," she said, "for my old age. My bones are quite sore;so if I be a little out of order in my conduct bear with me, and let usentertain each other while I remain in a recumbent position."Continuing, she desired Hu Po to make herself comfortable on the couch,and take a small club and tap her legs. No table stood below the couch,but only a high teapoy. On it were a high stand with tassels,flower-vases, incense-burners and other similar articles. But, a small,high table, laden with cups and chopsticks, had besides been got ready.At the table next to this, the four cousins, Pao-ch'in, Hsiang-yuen,Tai-yue and Pao-yue were told to seat themselves. The various viands andfruits that were brought in were first presented to dowager lady Chiafor inspection. If they took her fancy, she kept them at the smalltable. But once tasted by her, they were again removed and placed ontheir table. We could therefore safely say that none but the fourcousins sat along with their old grandmother.
The seats occupied by Madame Hsing and Madame Wang were below. Lowerdown came Mrs. Yu, Li Wan, lady Feng and Chia Jung's wife. On the westsat Pao-ch'ai, Li Wen, Li Ch'i, Chou Yen, Ying Ch'un, and the othercousins. On the large pillars, on either side, were suspended, in groupsof three and five, glass lanterns ornamented with fringes. In front ofeach table stood a candlestick in the shape of drooping lotus leaves.The candlesticks contained coloured candles. These lotus leaves wereprovided with enamelled springs, of foreign make, so they could betwisted outward, thus screening the rays of the lights and throwing them(on the stage), enabling one to watch the plays with exceptionaldistinctness. The window-frames and doors had all been removed. In everyplace figured coloured fringes, and various kinds of court lanterns.Inside and outside the verandahs, and under the roofs of the coveredpassages, which stretched on either side, were hung lanterns ofsheep-horn, glass, embroidered gauze or silk, decorated or painted, ofsatin or of paper.
Round different tables sat Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Huan, Chia Tsung,Chia Jung, Chia Yuen, Chia Ch'in, Chia Ch'ang, Chia Ling and other maleinmates of the family.
Dowager lady Chia had at an early hour likewise sent servants to invitethe male and female members of the whole clan. But those advanced inyears were not disposed to take part in any excitement. Some had no oneat the time to look after things; others too were detained byill-health; and much though these had every wish to be present, theywere not, after all, in a fit state to come. Some were so envious ofriches, and so ashamed of their poverty, that they entertained no desireto avail themselves of the invitation. Others, what is more, fosteredsuch a dislike for, and stood in such awe of, lady Feng that they feltbitter towards her and would not accept. Others again were timid andshy, and so little accustomed to seeing people, that they could notmuster sufficient courage to come. Hence it was that despite the largenumber of female relatives in the clan, none came but Chia Lan's mother,nee Lou, who brought Chia Lan with her. In the way of men, there wereonly Chia Ch'in, Chia Yuen, Chia Ch'ang and Chia Ling; the four of themand no others. The managers, at present under lady Feng's control, werehowever among those who accepted. But albeit there was not a completegathering of the inmates on this occasion, yet, for a small familyentertainment, sufficient animation characterised the proceedings.
About this time, Lin Chih-hsiao's wife also made her appearance, withhalf a dozen married women who carried three divan tables between them.Each table was covered with a red woollen cloth, on which lay a lot ofcash, picked out clean and of equal size, and recently issued from themint. These were strung together with a deep-red cord. Each couplecarried a table, so there were in all three tables.
Lin Chih-hsiao's wife directed that two tables should be placed belowthe festive board, round which were seated Mrs. Hsueeh and'sister-in-law' Li, and that one should be put at the foot of dowagerlady Chia's couch.
"Place it in the middle!" old lady Chia exclaimed. "These women havenever known what good manners mean. Put the table down." Saying this,she picked up the cash, and loosening the knots, she unstrung them andpiled them on the table.
'The reunion in the western chamber' was just being sung. The play wasdrawing to a close. They had reached a part where Yue Shu runs off atnight in high dudgeon, and Wen Pao jokingly cried out: "You go off withyour monkey up; but, as luck would have it, this is the very day of thefifteenth of the first moon, and a family banquet is being given by theold lady in the Jung Kuo mansion, so wait and I'll jump on this horseand hurry in and ask for something to eat. I must look sharp!" The jokemade old lady Chia, and the rest of the company laugh.
"What a dreadful, impish child!" Mrs. Hsueeh and the others exclaimed."Yet poor thing!"
"This child is only just nine years of age," lady Feng interposed.
"He has really made a clever hit!" dowager lady Chia laughed. "Tip him!"she shouted.
This shout over, three married women, who has previously got readyseveral small wicker baskets, came up, as soon as they heard the word'tip', and, taking the heaps of loose cash piled on the table, they eachfilled a basket full, and, issuing outside, they approached the stage."Dowager lady Chia, Mrs. Hsueeh, and the family relative, Mrs. Li,present Wen Pao this money to purchase something to eat with," theysaid.
At the end of these words, they flung the contents of the baskets uponthe stage. So all then that fell on the ear was the rattle of the cashflying in every direction over the boards.
Chia Chen and Chia Lien had, by this time, enjoined the pages to fetchbig baskets full of cash and have them in readiness. But as, reader, youdo not know as yet in what way these presents were given, listen to thecircumstances detailed in the subsequent chapter.

CHAPTER LIV.
  Dowager lady Chia, nee Shih, does away with rotten old customs.  Wang Hsi-feng imitates in jest (the dutiful son), by getting herself      up in gaudy theatrical clothes.
Chia Chen and Chia Lien had, we will now explain, secretly got readylarge baskets of cash, so the moment they heard old lady Chia utter theword 'tip,' they promptly bade the pages be quick and fling the money.The noise of the cash, running on every side of the stage, was all thatfell on the ear. Dowager lady Chia thoroughly enjoyed it.
The two men then rose to their feet. The pages hastened to lay hold of asilver kettle, newly brought in with fresh wine, and to deposit it inChia Lien's hands, who followed Chia Chen with quick step into the innerrooms. Chia Chen advanced first up to 'sister-in-law' Li's table, andcurtseying, he raised her cup, and turned round, whereupon Chia Lienquickly filled it to the brim. Next they approached Mrs. Hsueeh's table,and they also replenished her cup.
These two ladies lost no time in standing up, and smilinglyexpostulating. "Gentlemen," they said, "please take your seats. What'sthe use of standing on such ceremonies?"
But presently every one, with the exception of the two ladies MesdamesHsing and Wang, quitted the banquet and dropping their arms againsttheir bodies they stood on one side. Chia Chen and his companion thendrew near dowager lady Chia's couch. But the couch was so low that theyhad to stoop on their knees. Chia Chen was in front, and presented thecup. Chia Lien was behind, and held the kettle up to her. Butnotwithstanding that only these two offered her wine, Chia Tsung and theother young men followed them closely in the order of their age andgrade; so the moment they saw them kneel, they immediately threwthemselves on their knees. Pao-yue too prostrated himself at once.
Hsiang-yuen stealthily gave him a push. "What's the use of your nowfollowing their lead again and falling on your knees?" she said. "Butsince you behave like this, wouldn't it be well if you also went andpoured wine all round?"
Pao-yue laughed. "Hold on a bit," he rejoined in a low tone, "and I'll goand do so."
So speaking, he waited until his two relatives had finished pouring thewine and risen to their feet, when he also went and replenished the cupsof Mesdames Wang and Hsing.
"What about the young ladies?" Chia Chen smilingly asked.
"You people had better be going," old lady Chia and the other ladiesunanimously observed. "They'll, then, be more at their ease."
At this hint Chia Chen and his companions eventually withdrew. Thesecond watch had not, at the time, yet gone. The play that was beingsung was: 'The eight worthies look at the lanterns,' consisting of eightacts; and had now reached a sensational part.
Pao-yue at this stage left the feast and was going out. "Where are youoff to?" inquired his grandmother Chia. "The crackers outside aredreadful. Mind, the lighted pieces of paper falling from above mightburn you."
Pao-yue smiled. "I'm not going far," he answered. "I'm merely going outof the room, and will be back at once."
Dowager lady Chia directed the matrons to "be careful and escort him."
Pao-yue forthwith sallied out; with no other attendants however than SheYueeh, Ch'iu Wen and several youthful maids.
"How is it," his grandmother Chia felt obliged so ask, "that I don't seeanything of Hsi Jen? Is she too now putting on high and mighty airs thatshe only sends these juvenile girls here?"
Madame Wang rose to her feet with all haste. "Her mother," sheexplained, "died the other day; so being in deep mourning, she couldn'tvery well present herself."
Dowager lady Chia nodded her head assentingly. "When one is in service,"she smilingly remarked, "there should be no question of mourning or nomourning. Is it likely that, if she were still in my pay, she wouldn'tat present be here? All these practices have quite become precedents!"
Lady Feng crossed over to her. "Had she even not been in mourningto-night," she chimed in with a laugh, "she would have had to be in thegarden and keep an eye over that pile of lanterns, candles, andfireworks, as they're most dangerous things. For as soon as anytheatricals are set on foot in here, who doesn't surreptitiously sneakout from the garden to have a look? But as far as she goes, she'sdiligent, and careful of every place. Moreover, when the companydisperses and brother Pao-yue retires to sleep, everything will be inperfect readiness. But, had she also come, that bevy of servantswouldn't again have cared a straw for anything; and on his return, afterthe party, the bedding would have been cold, the tea-water wouldn't havebeen ready, and he would have had to put up with every sort ofdiscomfort. That's why I told her that there was no need for her tocome. But should you, dear senior, wish her here, I'll send for herstraightway and have done."
Old lady Chia lent an ear to her arguments. "What you say," she promptlyput in, "is perfectly right. You've made better arrangements than Icould. Quick, don't send for her! But when did her mother die? How is itI know nothing about it?"
"Some time ago," lady Feng laughed, "Hsi Jen came in person and toldyou, worthy ancestor, and how is it you've forgotten it?"
"Yes," resumed dowager lady Chia smiling, after some reflection, "Iremember now. My memory is really not of the best."
At this, everybody gave way to laughter. "How could your venerableladyship," they said, "recollect so many matters?"
Dowager lady Chia thereupon heaved a sigh. "How I remember," she added,"the way she served me ever since her youth up; and how she waited uponYuen Erh also; how at last she was given to that prince of devils, andhow she has slaved away with that imp for the last few years. She is,besides, not a slave-girl, born or bred in the place. Nor has she everreceived any great benefits from our hands. When her mother died, Imeant to have given her several taels for her burial; but it quiteslipped from my mind."
"The other day," lady Feng remarked, "Madame Wang presented her withforty taels; so that was all right."
At these words, old lady Chia nodded assent. "Yes, never mind aboutthat," she observed. "Yuan Yang's mother also died, as it happens, theother day; but taking into consideration that both her parents lived inthe south, I didn't let her return home to observe a period of mourning.But as both these girls are now in mourning, why not allow them to livetogether? They'll thus be able to keep each other company. Take a fewfruits, eatables, and other such things," continuing she bade a matron,"and give them to those two girls to eat."
"Would she likely wait until now?" Hu Po laughingly interposed. "Why,she joined (Hsi Jen) long ago."
In the course of this conversation, the various inmates partook of somemore wine, and watched the theatricals.
But we will now turn our attention to Pao-yue. He made his way straightinto the garden. The matrons saw well enough that he was returning tohis rooms, but instead of following him in, they ensconced themselvesnear the fire in the tea-room situated by the garden-gate, and made thebest of the time by drinking and playing cards with the girls in chargeof the tea. Pao-yue entered the court. The lanterns burnt brightly, yetnot a human voice was audible. "Have they all, forsooth, gone to sleep?"She Yueeh ventured. "Let's walk in gently, and give them a fright!"
Presently, they stepped, on tiptoe, past the mirrored partition-wall. Ata glance, they discerned Hsi Jen lying on the stove-couch, face to facewith some other girl. On the opposite side sat two or three old nursesnodding, half asleep. Pao-yue conjectured that both the girls wereplunged in sleep, and was just about to enter, when of a sudden some onewas heard to heave a sigh and to say: "How evident it is that worldlymatters are very uncertain! Here you lived all alone in here, while yourfather and mother tarried abroad, and roamed year after year from eastto west, without any fixed place of abode. I ever thought that youwouldn't have been able to be with them at their last moments; but, asit happened, (your mother) died in this place this year, and you could,after all, stand by her to the end."
"Quite so!" rejoined Hsi Jen. "Even I little expected to be able to seeany of my parents' funeral. When I broke the news to our Madame Wang,she also gave me forty taels. This was really a kind attention on herpart. I hadn't nevertheless presumed to indulge in any vain hopes."
Pao-yue overheard what was said. Hastily twisting himself round, heremarked in a low voice, addressing himself to She Yueeh and hercompanions: "Who would have fancied her also in here? But were I toenter, she'll bolt away in another tantrum! Better then that we shouldretrace our steps, and let them quietly have a chat together, eh? HsiJen was alone, and down in the mouth, so it's a fortunate thing that shejoined her in such good time."
As he spoke, they once more walked out of the court with gentle tread.Pao-yue went to the back of the rockery, and stopping short, he raisedhis clothes. She Yueeh and Ch'iu Wen stood still, and turned their facesaway. "Stoop," they smiled, "and then loosen your clothes! Be carefulthat the wind doesn't blow on your stomach!"
The two young maids, who followed behind, surmised that he was bent uponsatisfying a natural want, and they hurried ahead to the tea-room toprepare the water.
Just, however, as Pao-yue was crossing over, two married women came insight, advancing from the opposite direction. "Who's there?" theyinquired.
"Pao-yue is here," Ch'ing Wen answered. "But mind, if you bawl and shoutlike that, you'll give him a start."
The women promptly laughed. "We had no idea," they said, "that we werecoming, at a great festive time like this, to bring trouble uponourselves! What a lot of hard work must day after day fall to yourshare, young ladies."
Speaking the while, they drew near. She Yueeh and her friends then askedthem what they were holding in their hands.
"We're taking over," they replied, "some things to the two girls: MissChin and Miss Hua."
"They're still singing the 'Eight Worthies' outside," She Yueeh went onto observe laughingly, "and how is it you're running again to MissChin's and Miss Hua's before the 'Trouble-first moon-box' has been gonethrough?"
"Take the lid off," Pao-yue cried, "and let me see what there's inside."
Ch'in Wen and She Yueeh at once approached and uncovered the boxes. Thetwo women promptly stooped, which enabled Pao-yue to see that thecontents of the two boxes consisted alike of some of the finest fruitsand tea-cakes, which had figured at the banquet, and, nodding his head,he walked off, while She Yueeh and her friend speedily threw the lidsdown anyhow, and followed in his track.
"Those two dames are pleasant enough," Pao-yue smiled, "and they know howto speak decently; but it's they who get quite worn out every day, andthey contrariwise say that you've got ample to do daily. Now, doesn'tthis amount to bragging and boasting?"
"Those two women," She Yueeh chimed in, "are not bad. But such of them asdon't know what good manners mean are ignorant to a degree of allpropriety."
"You, who know what's what," Pao-yue added, "should make allowances forthat kind of rustic people. You should pity them; that's all."
Speaking, he made his exit out of the garden gate. The matrons had,though engaged in drinking and gambling, kept incessantly stepping outof doors to furtively keep an eye on his movements, so that the momentthey perceived Pao-yue appear, they followed him in a body. On theirarrival in the covered passage of the reception-hall, they espied twoyoung waiting-maids; the one with a small basin in her hand; the otherwith a towel thrown over her arm. They also held a bowl and smallkettle, and had been waiting in that passage for ever so long.
Ch'iu Wen was the first to hastily stretch out her hand and test thewater. "The older you grow," she cried, "the denser you get! How couldone ever use this icy-cold water?"
"Miss, look at the weather!" the young maid replied. "I was afraid thewater would get cold. It was really scalding; is it cold now?"
While she made this rejoinder, an old matron was, by a strangecoincidence, seen coming along, carrying a jug of hot water. "Deardame," shouted the young maid, "come over and pour some for me in here!"
"My dear girl," the matron responded, "this is for our old mistress tobrew tea with. I'll tell you what; you'd better go and fetch someyourself. Are you perchance afraid lest your feet might grow bigger bywalking?"
"I don't care whose it is," Ch'iu Wen put in. "If you don't give me any,I shall certainly empty our old lady's teapot and wash my hands."
The old matron turned her head; and, catching sight of Ch'iu Wen, shethere and then raised the jug and poured some of the water.
"That will do!" exclaimed Ch'iu Wen. "With all your years, don't you yetknow what's what? Who isn't aware that it's for our old mistress? Butwould one presume to ask for what shouldn't be asked for?"
"My eyes are so dim," the matron rejoined with a smile, "that I didn'trecognise this young lady."
When Pao-yue had washed his hands, the young maid took the small jug andfilled the bowl; and, as she held it in her hand, Pao-yue rinsed hismouth. But Ch'iu Wen and She Yueeh availed themselves likewise of thewarm water to have a wash; after which, they followed Pao-yue in.
Pao-yue at once asked for a kettle of warm wine, and, starting fromsister-in-law Li, he began to replenish their cups. (Sister-in-law Liand his aunt Hsueeh) pressed him, however, with smiling faces, to take aseat; but his grandmother Chia remonstrated. "He's only a youngster,"she said, "so let him pour the wine! We must all drain this cup!"
With these words, she quaffed her own cup, leaving no heel-taps.Mesdames Hsing and Wang also lost no time in emptying theirs; so Mrs.Hsueeh and 'sister-in-law' Li had no alternative but to drain theirshare.
"Fill the cups too of your female cousins, senior or junior," dowagerlady Chia went on to tell Pao-yue. "And you mayn't pour the wine anyhow.Each of you must swallow every drop of your drinks."
Pao-yue upon hearing her wishes, set to work, while signifying hisassent, to replenish the cups of the several young ladies in theirproper gradation. But when he got to Tai-yue, she raised the cup, for shewould not drink any wine herself, and applied it to Pao-yue's lips.Pao-yue drained the contents with one breath; upon which Tai-yue gave hima smile, and said to him: "I am much obliged to you."
Pao-yue next poured a cup for her. But lady Feng immediately laughed andexpostulated. "Pao-yue!" she cried, "you mustn't take any cold wine.Mind, your hand will tremble, and you won't be able to-morrow to writeyour characters or to draw the bow."
"I'm not having any cold wine," Pao-yue replied.
"I know you're not," lady Feng smiled, "but I simply warn you."
After this, Pao-yue finished helping the rest of the inmates inside, withthe exception of Chia Jung's wife, for whom he bade a maid fill a cup.Then emerging again into the covered passage, he replenished the cups ofChia Chen and his companions; after which, he tarried with them for awhile, and at last walked in and resumed his former seat.
Presently, the soup was brought, and soon after that the 'feast oflanterns' cakes were handed round.
Dowager lady Chia gave orders that the play should be interrupted for atime. "Those young people," (she said) "are be to pitied! Let them toohave some hot soup and warm viands. They then can go on again. Take ofevery kind of fruit," she continued, "'feast of lanterns' cakes, andother such dainties and give them a few."
The play was shortly stopped. The matrons ushered in a couple of blindsinging-girls, who often came to the house, and put two benches, on theopposite side, for them. Old lady Chia desired them to take a seat, andbanjos and guitars were then handed to them.
"What stories would you like to hear?" old lady Chia inquired of'sister-in-law' Li and Mrs. Hsueeh.
"We don't care what they are;" both of them rejoined with one voice."Any will do!"
"Have you of late added any new stories to your stock?" old lady Chiaasked.
"We've got a new story," the two girls explained. "It's about an oldaffair of the time of the Five Dynasties, which trod down the T'angdynasty."
"What's its title?" old lady Chia inquired.
"It's called: 'A Feng seeks a Luan in marriage': (the male phoenix asksthe female phoenix in marriage)," one of the girls answered.
"The title is all very well," dowager lady Chia proceeded, "but why Iwonder was it ever given to it. First tell us its general purport, andif it's interesting, you can continue."
"This story," the girl explained, "treats of the time when the T'angdynasty was extinguished. There lived then one of the gentry, who hadoriginally been a denizen of Chin Ling. His name was Wang Chun. He hadbeen minister under two reigns. He had, about this time, pleaded old ageand returned to his home. He had about his knees only one son, calledWang Hsi-feng."
When the company heard so far, they began to laugh.
"Now isn't this a duplicate of our girl Feng's name?" old lady Chialaughingly exclaimed.
A married woman hurried up and pushed (the girl). "That's the name ofyour lady Secunda," she said, "so don't use it quite so heedlessly!"
"Go on with your story!" dowager lady Chia shouted.
The girl speedily stood up, smiling the while. "We do deserve death!"she observed. "We weren't aware that it was our lady's worthy name."
"Why should you be in such fear and trembling?" lady Feng laughed. "Goon! There are many duplicate names and duplicate surnames."
The girl then proceeded with her story. "In a certain year," sheresumed, "his honour old Mr. Wang saw his son Mr. Wang off for thecapital to be in time for the examinations. One day, he was overtaken bya heavy shower of rain and he betook himself into a village for shelter.Who'd have thought it, there lived in this village, one of the gentry,of the name of Li, who had been an old friend of his honour old Mr.Wang, and he kept Mr. Wang junior to put up in his library. This Mr. Lihad no son, but only a daughter. This young daughter's worthy name wasCh'u Luan. She could perform on the lute; she could play chess; and shehad a knowledge of books and of painting. There was nothing that she didnot understand."
Old lady Chia eagerly chimed in. "It's no wonder," she said, "that thestory has been called: 'A Feng seeks a Luan in marriage,' '(a malephoenix seeks a female phoenix in marriage).' But you needn't proceed.I've already guessed the denouement. There's no doubt that Wang Hsi-fengasks for the hand of this Miss Ch'u Luan."
"Your venerable ladyship must really have heard the story before," thesinging-girl smiled.
"What hasn't our worthy senior heard?" they all exclaimed. "But she'squick enough in guessing even unheard of things."
"All these stories run invariably in one line," old lady Chia laughinglyrejoined. "They're all about pretty girls and scholars. There's no funin them. They abuse people's daughters in every possible way, and thenthey still term them nice pretty girls. They're so concocted thatthere's not even a semblance of truth in them. From the very first, theycanvass the families of the gentry. If the paterfamilias isn't apresident of a board; then he's made a minister. The heroine is bound tobe as lovable as a gem. This young lady is sure to understand all aboutletters, and propriety. She knows every thing and is, in a word, apeerless beauty. At the sight of a handsome young man, she pays no heedas to whether he be relation or friend, but begins to entertain thoughtsof the primary affair of her life, and forgets her parents and sets herbooks on one side. She behaves as neither devil nor thief would: so inwhat respect does she resemble a nice pretty girl? Were even her brainfull of learning, she couldn't be accounted a nice pretty girl, afterbehaving in this manner! Just like a young fellow, whose mind is wellstored with book-lore, and who goes and plays the robber! Now is itlikely that the imperial laws would look upon him as a man of parts, andthat they wouldn't bring against him some charge of robbery? From thisit's evident that those, who fabricate these stories, contradictthemselves. Besides, they may, it's true, say that the heroines belongto great families of official and literary status, that they'reconversant with propriety and learning and that their honourable motherstoo understand books and good manners, but great households like theirsmust, in spite of the parents having pleaded old age and returned totheir natives places, contain a great number of inmates; and the nurses,maids and attendants on these young ladies must also be many; and how isit then that, whenever these stories make reference to such matters, oneonly hears of young ladies with but a single close attendant? What can,think for yourselves, all the other people be up to? Indeed, what issaid before doesn't accord with what comes afterwards. Isn't it so, eh?"
The party listened to her with much glee. "These criticisms of yours,venerable ancestor," they said, "have laid bare every singlediscrepancy."
"They have however their reasons," old lady Chia smilingly resumed."Among the writers of these stories, there are some, who begrudgepeople's wealth and honours, or possibly those, who having solicited afavour (of the wealthy and honorable), and not obtained the object, uponwhich their wishes were set, have fabricated lies in order to disparagepeople. There is moreover a certain class of persons, who become socorrupted by the perusal of such tales that they are not satisfied untilthey themselves pounce upon some nice pretty girl. Hence is it that, forfun's sake, they devise all these yarns. But how could such as they everknow the principle which prevails in official and literary families? Notto speak of the various official and literary families spoken about inthese anecdotes, take now our own immediate case as an instance. We'reonly such a middle class household, and yet we've got none of thoseoccurrences; so don't let her go on spinning these endless yarns. Wemust on no account have any of these stories told us! Why, even themaids themselves don't understand any of this sort of language. I'vebeen getting so old the last few years, that I felt unawares quitemelancholy whenever the girls went to live far off, so my wont has beento have a few passages recounted to me; but as soon as they got back, Iat once put a stop to these things."
'Sister-in-law' Li and Mrs. Hsueeh both laughed. "This is just the rule,"they said, "which should exist in great families. Not even in our homesis any of this confused talk allowed to reach the ears of the youngpeople."
Lady Feng came forward and poured some wine. "Enough, that will do!" shelaughed. "The wine has got quite cold. My dear ancestor, do take a sipand moisten your throat with, before you begin again to dilate onfalsehoods. What we've been having now can well be termed 'Record of adiscussion on falsehoods.' It has had its origin in this reign, in thisplace, in this year, in this moon, on this day and at this very season.But, venerable senior, you've only got one mouth, so you couldn't verywell simultaneously speak of two families. 'When two flowers opentogether,' the proverb says, 'one person can only speak of one.' Butwhether the stones be true or fictitious, don't let us say anything moreabout them. Let's have the footlights put in order, and look at theplayers. Dear senior, do let these two relatives have a glass of wineand see a couple of plays; and you can then start arguing about onedynasty after another. Eh, what do you say?"
Saying this, she poured the wine, laughing the while. But she hadscarcely done speaking before the whole company were convulsed withlaughter. The two singing girls were themselves unable to keep theircountenance.
"Lady Secunda," they both exclaimed, "what a sharp tongue you have! Wereyour ladyship to take to story-telling, we really would have nowhere toearn our rice."
"Don't be in such overflowing spirits," Mrs. Hsueeh laughed. "There arepeople outside; this isn't like any ordinary occasion."
"There's only my senior brother-in-law Chen outside," lady Feng smiled."And we've been like brother and sister from our youth up. We've rompedand been up to every mischief to this age together. But all on accountof my marriage, I've had of late years to stand on ever so manyceremonies. Why besides being like brother and sister from the time wewere small kids, he's anyhow my senior brother-in-law, and I his juniorsister-in-law. (One among) those twenty four dutiful sons, travestiedhimself in theatrical costume (to amuse his parents), but those fellowshaven't sufficient spirit to come in some stage togs and try and makeyou have a laugh, dear ancestor. I've however succeeded, after ever somuch exertion, in so diverting you as to induce you to eat a little morethan you would, and in putting everybody in good humour; and I should bethanked by one and all of you; it's only right that I should. But can itbe that you will, on the contrary, poke fun at me?"
"I've truly not had a hearty laugh the last few days," old lady Chiasmiled, "but thanks to the funny things she recounted just now, I'vemanaged to get in somewhat better spirits in here. So I'll have anothercup of wine." Then having drunk her wine, "Pao-yue," she went on to say,"come and present a cup to your sister-in-law!"
Lady Feng gave a smile. "There's no use for him to give me any wine,"she ventured. "(I'll drink out of your cup,) so as to bring upon myselfyour longevity, venerable ancestor."
While uttering this response, she raised dowager lady Chia's cup to herlips, and drained the remaining half of the contents; after which, shehanded the cup to a waiting-maid, who took one from those which had beenrinsed with tepid water, and brought it to her. But in due course, thecups from the various tables were cleared, and clean ones, washed inwarm water, were substituted; and when fresh wine had been served round,(lady Feng and the maid) resumed their seats.
"Venerable lady," a singing-girl put in, "you don't like the stories wetell; but may we thrum a song for you?"
"You two," remarked old lady Chia, "had better play a duet of the'Chiang Chuen ling' song: 'the general's command.'"
Hearing her wishes, the two girls promptly tuned their cords, to suitthe pitch of the song, and struck up on their guitars.
"What watch of the night is it?" old lady Chia at this point inquired.
"It's the third watch," the matrons replied with alacrity.
"No wonder it has got so chilly and damp!" old lady Chia added.
Extra clothes were accordingly soon fetched by the servants and maids.
Madame Wang speedily rose to her feet and forced a smile. "Venerablesenior," she said, "wouldn't it be prudent for you to move on to thestove couch in the winter apartments? It would be as well. These tworelatives are no strangers. And if we entertain them, it will he allright."
"Well, in that case," dowager lady Chia smilingly rejoined, "whyshouldn't the whole company adjourn inside? Wouldn't it be warmer for usall?"
"I'm afraid there isn't enough sitting room for every one of us," MadameWang explained.
"I've got a plan," old lady Chia added. "We can now dispense with thesetables. All we need are two or three, placed side by side; we can thensit in a group, and by bundling together it will be both sociable aswell as warm."
"Yes, this will be nice!" one and all cried.
Assenting, they forthwith rose from table. The married women hastened toremove the debandade of the banquet. Then placing three large tableslengthways side by side in the inner rooms, they went on to properlyarrange the fruits and viands, some of which had been replenished,others changed.
"You must none of you stand on any ceremonies!" dowager lady Chiaobserved. "If you just listen while I allot you your places, and sitdown accordingly, it will be all right!"
Continuing, she motioned to Mrs. Hsueeh and 'sister-in-law' Li to takethe upper seats on the side of honour, and, making herself comfortableon the west, she bade the three cousins Pao-ch'in, Tai-yue and Hsian-yuensit close to her on the left and on the right. "Pao-yue," she proceeded"you must go next to your mother." So presently she put Pao-yue, andPao-ch'ai and the rest of the young ladies between Mesdames Hsing andWang. On the west, she placed, in proper gradation, dame Lou, along withChia Lan, and Mrs. Yu and Li Wan, with Chia Lan, (number two,) betweenthem. While she assigned a chair to Chia Jung's wife among the lowerseats, put crosswise. "Brother Chen," old lady Chia cried, "take yourcousins and be off! I'm also going to sleep in a little time."
Chia Chen and his associates speedily expressed their obedience, andmade, in a body, their appearance inside again to listen to anyinjunctions she might have to give them.
"Bundle yourself away at once!" shouted dowager lady Chia. "You needn'tcome in. We've just sat down, and you'll make us get up again. Go andrest; be quick! To-morrow, there are to be some more grand doings!" ChiaChen assented with alacrity. "But Jung Erh should remain to replenishthe cups," he smiled; "it's only fair that he should."
"Quite so!" answered old lady Chia laughingly. "I forgot all about him."
"Yes!" acquiesced Chia Chen. Then twisting himself round, he led ChiaLien and his companions out of the apartment.
(Chia Chen and Chia Lien) were, of course, both pleased at being able toget away. So bidding the servants see Chia Tsung and Chia Huang to theirrespective homes, (Chia Chen) arranged with Chia Lien to go in pursuitof pleasure and in quest of fun. But we will now leave them to their owndevices without another word.
"I was just thinking," meanwhile dowager lady Chia laughed, "that itwould be well, although you people are numerous enough to enjoyyourselves, to have a couple of great-grandchildren present at thisbanquet, so Jung Erh now makes the full complement. But Jung Erh sitnear your wife, for she and you will then make the pair complete."
The wife of a domestic thereupon presented a play-bill.
"We, ladies," old lady Chia demurred, "are now chatting in high glee,and are about to start a romp. Those young folks have, also, beensitting up so far into the night that they must be quite cold, so letthe plays alone. Tell them then to have a rest. Yet call our own girlsto come and sing a couple of plays on this stage. They too will thushave a chance of watching us a bit."
After lending an ear to her, the married women assented and quitted theroom. And immediately finding some servant to go to the garden of BroadVista and summon the girls, they betook themselves, at the same time, asfar as the second gate and called a few pages to wait on them.
The pages went with hurried step to the rooms reserved for the players,and taking with them the various grown-up members of the company, theyonly left the more youthful behind. Then fetching, in a little time, WenKuan and a few other girls, twelve in all, from among the novices in thePear Fragrance court, they egressed by the corner gate leading out ofthe covered passage. The matrons took soft bundles in their arms, astheir strength was not equal to carrying boxes. And under the convictionthat their old mistress would prefer plays of three or five acts, theyhad put together the necessary theatrical costumes.
After Wen Kuan and the rest of the girls had been introduced into theroom by the matrons, they paid their obeisance, and, dropping their armsagainst their sides, they stood reverentially.
"In this propitious first moon," old lady Chia smiled, "won't yourteacher let you come out for a stroll? What are you singing now? Theeight acts of the 'Eight worthies' recently sung here were so noisy,that they made my head ache; so you'd better let us have something morequiet. You must however bear in mind that Mrs. Hsueeh and Mrs. Li areboth people, who give theatricals, and have heard I don't know how manyfine plays. The young ladies here have seen better plays than our owngirls; and they have heard more beautiful songs than they. Theseactresses, you see here now, formed once, despite their youth, part of acompany belonging to renowned families, fond of plays; and though merechildren, they excel any troupe composed of grown-up persons. Sowhatever we do, don't let us say anything disparaging about them. But wemust now have something new. Tell Fang Kuan to sing us the 'Hsuen Meng'ballad; and let only flutes and Pandean pipes be used. The otherinstruments can be dispensed with."
"Your venerable ladyship is quite right," Wen Kuan smiled. "Our actingcouldn't, certainly, suit the taste of such people as Mrs. Hsueeh, Mrs.Li and the young ladies. Nevertheless, let them merely heed ourenunciation, and listen to our voices; that's all."
"Well said!" dowager lady Chia laughed.
'Sister-in-law' Li and Mrs. Hsueeh were filled with delight. "What asharp girl!" they remarked smilingly. "But do you also try to imitateour old lady by pulling our leg?"
"They're intended to afford us some ready-at-hand recreation," old ladyChia smiled. "Besides, they don't go out to earn money. That's how it isthey are not so much up to the times." At the close of this remark, shealso desired K'uei Kuan to sing the play: 'Hui Ming sends a letter.'"You needn't," she added, "make your face up. Just sing this couple ofplays so as to merely let both those ladies hear a kind of parody ofthem. But if you spare yourselves the least exertion, I shall beunhappy."
When they heard this, Wen Kuan and her companions left the apartment andpromptly apparelled themselves and mounted the stage. First in order,was sung the 'Hsuen Meng;' next, '(Hui Ming) sends a letter;' duringwhich, everybody observed such perfect silence that not so much as thecaw of a crow fell on the ear.
"I've verily seen several hundreds of companies," Mrs. Hsueeh smiled,"but never have I come across any that confined themselves to flutes."
"There are some," dowager lady Chia answered. "In fact, in that playacted just now called: 'Love in the western tower at Ch'u Ch'iang,'there's a good deal sung by young actors in unison with the flutes. Butlengthy unison pieces of this description are indeed few. This too,however, is purely a matter of taste; there's nothing out of the wayabout it. When I was of her age," resuming, she pointed at Hsiang-yuen,"her grandfather kept a troupe of young actresses. There was among themone, who played the lute so efficiently that she performed the part whenthe lute is heard in the 'Hsi Hsiang Chi,' the piece on the lute in the'Yue Ts'an Chi,' and that in the supplementary 'P'i Pa Chi,' on theMongol flageolet with the eighteen notes, in every way as if she hadbeen placed in the real circumstances herself. Yea, far better thanthis!"
"This is still rarer a thing!" the inmates exclaimed.
Old lady Chia then shortly called the married women, and bade them tellWen Kuan and the other girls to use both wind and string instruments andrender the piece; 'At the feast of lanterns, the moon is round.'
The women servants received her orders and went to execute them. ChiaJung and his wife meanwhile passed the wine round.
When lady Feng saw dowager lady Chia in most exuberant spirits, shesmiled. "Won't it be nice," she said, "to avail ourselves of thepresence of the singing girls to pass plum blossom round and have thegame of forfeits: 'Spring-happy eyebrow-corners-go-up,' eh?"
"That's a fine game of forfeits!" Old lady Chia cried, with a smile. "Itjust suits the time of the year."
Orders were therefore given at once to fetch a forfeit drum, varnishedblack, and ornamented with designs executed with copper tacks. Whenbrought, it was handed to the singing girls to put on the table and rapon it. A twig of red plum blossom was then obtained. "The one in whosehand it is when the drum stops," dowager lady Chia laughingly proposed,"will have to drink a cup of wine, and to say something or other aswell."
"I'll tell you what," lady Feng interposed with a smile. "Who of us canpit herself against you, dear ancestor, who have ever ready at handwhatever you want to say? With the little use we are in this line, won'tthere be an absolute lack of fun in our contributions? My idea is thatit would be nicer were something said that could be appreciated both bythe refined as well as the unrefined. So won't it be preferable that theperson, in whose hands the twig remains, when the drum stops, shouldcrack some joke or other?"
Every one, who heard her, was fully aware what a good hand she hadalways been at witty things, and how she, more than any other, had aninexhaustible supply of novel and amusing rules of forfeits, everstocked in her mind, so her suggestion not only gratified the variousinmates of the family seated at the banquet, but even filled the wholeposse of servants, both old and young, who stood in attendance below,with intense delight. The young waiting-maids rushed with eagerness insearch of the young ladies and told them to come and listen to theirlady Secunda, who was on the point again of saying funny things. A wholecrowd of servant-girls anxiously pressed inside and crammed the room. Ina little time, the theatricals were brought to a close, and the musicwas stopped. Dowager lady Chia had some soup, fine cakes and fruitshanded to Wen Kuan and her companions to regale themselves with, andthen gave orders to sound the drum. The singing-girls were both experts,so now they beat fast; and now slow. Either slow like the dripping ofthe remnants of water in a clepsydra. Or quick, as when beans are beingsown. Or with the velocity of the pace of a scared horse, or that of theflash of a swift lightning. The sound of the drum came to a standstillabruptly. The twig of plum blossom had just reached old lady Chia, whenby a strange coincidence, the rattle ceased. Every one blurted out intoa boisterous fit of laughter. Chia Jung hastily approached and filled acup. "It's only natural," they laughingly cried, "that you venerablesenior, should be the first to get exhilarated; for then, thanks to you,we shall also come in for some measure of good cheer."
"To gulp down this wine is an easy job," dowager lady smiled, "but tocrack jokes is somewhat difficult."
"Your jokes, dear ancestor, are even wittier than those of lady Feng,"the party shouted, "so favour us with one, and let's have a laugh!"
"I've nothing out of the way to evoke laughter with," old lady Chiasmilingly answered. "Yet all that remains for me to do is to thicken theskin of my antiquated phiz and come out with some joke. In a certainfamily," she consequently went on to narrate, "there were ten sons;these married ten wives. The tenth of these wives was, however, sointelligent, sharp, quick of mind, and glib of tongue, that her fatherand mother-in-law loved her best of all, and maintained from morning tonight that the other nine were not filial. These nine felt muchaggrieved and they accordingly took counsel together. 'We nine,' theysaid, 'are filial enough at heart; the only thing is that that shrew hasthe gift of the gab. That's why our father and mother-in-law think herso perfect. But to whom can we go and confide our grievance?' One ofthem was struck with an idea. 'Let's go to-morrow,' she proposed, 'tothe temple of the King of Hell and burn incense. We can then tell theKing our grudge and ask him how it was that, when he bade us receivelife and become human beings, he only conferred a glib tongue on thatvixen and that we were only allotted such blunt mouths?' The eightlistened to her plan, and were quite enraptured with it. 'This proposalis faultless!' they assented. On the next day, they sped in a body tothe temple of the God of Hell, and after burning incense, the ninesisters-in-law slept under the altar, on which their offerings werelaid. Their nine spirits waited with the special purpose of seeing thecarriage of the King of Hell arrive; but they waited and waited, and yethe did not come. They were just giving way to despair when they espiedSun Hsing-che, (the god of monkeys), advancing on a rolling cloud. Heespied the nine spirits, and felt inclined to take a golden rod and beatthem. The nine spirits were plunged in terror. Hastily they fell ontheir knees, and pleaded for mercy."
"'What are you up to?' Sun Hsing-che inquired."
"The nine women, with alacrity, told him all."
"After Sun Hsing-che had listened to their confidences, he stamped hisfoot and heaved a sigh. 'Is that the case?' he asked. 'Well, it's luckyenough you came across me, for had you waited for the God of Hell, hewouldn't have known anything about it.'"
"At these assurances, the nine women gave way to entreaties. 'Greatsaint,' they pleaded, 'if you were to display some commiseration, wewould be all right.'"
"Sun Hsing-che smiled. 'There's no difficulty in the way,' he observed.'On the day on which you ten sisters-in-law came to life, I was, as luckwould have it, on a visit to the King of Hell's place. So I (saw) him dosomething on the ground, and the junior sister-of-law of yours lap itup. But if you now wish to become smart and sharp-tongued, the remedylies in water. If I too were therefore to do something, and you to drinkit, the desired effect will be attained.'"
At the close of her story, the company roared with laughter.
"Splendid!" shouted lady Feng. "But luckily we're all slow of tongue anddull of intellect, otherwise, we too must have had the water of monkeysto drink."
"Who among us here," Mrs. Yu and dame Lou smilingly remarked, addressingthemselves to Li Wan, "has tasted any monkey's water. So don't shamignorance of things!"
"A joke must hit the point to be amusing," Mrs. Hsueeh ventured.
But while she spoke, (the girls) began again to beat the drum. The youngmaids were keen to hear lady Feng's jokes. They therefore explained tothe singing girls, in a confidential tone, that a cough would be thegiven signal (for them to desist). In no time (the blossom) was handedround on both sides. As soon as it came to lady Feng, the young maidspurposely gave a cough. The singing-girl at once stopped short. "Nowwe've caught her!" shouted the party laughingly; "drink your wine, bequick! And mind you tell something nice! But don't make us laugh soheartily as to get stomachaches."
Lady Feng was lost in thought. Presently, she began with a smile. "Acertain household," she said, "was celebrating the first moon festival.The entire family was enjoying the sight of the lanterns, and drinkingtheir wine. In real truth unusual excitement prevailed. There were greatgrandmothers, grandmothers, daughters-in-law, grandsons' wives, greatgrandsons, granddaughters, granddaughters-in-law, aunts' granddaughters,cousins' granddaughters; and ai-yo-yo, there was verily such a bustleand confusion!"
While minding her story, they laughed. "Listen to all this mean mouthsays!" they cried. "We wonder what other ramifications she won'tintroduce!"
"If you want to bully me," Mrs. Yu smiled, "I'll tear that mouth ofyours to pieces."
Lady Feng rose to her feet and clapped her hands.
"One does all one can to rack one's brain," she smiled, "and here youcombine to do your utmost to confuse me! Well, if it is so, I won't goon."
"Proceed with your story," old lady Chia exclaimed with a smile. "Whatcomes afterwards?"
Lady Feng thought for a while. "Well, after that," she continuedlaughingly, "they all sat together and crammed the whole room. Theyprimed themselves with wine throughout the hours of night and then theybroke up."
The various inmates noticed in what a serious and sedate manner shenarrated her story, and none ventured to pass any further remarks, butwaited anxiously for her to go on, when they became aware that shecoldly and drily came to a stop.
Shih Hsiang-yuen stared at her for ever so long.
"I'll tell you another," lady Feng laughingly remarked. "At the firstmoon festival, several persons carried a cracker as large as a room andwent out of town to let it off. Over and above ten thousand persons wereattracted, and they followed to see the sight. One among them was of animpatient disposition. He could not reconcile himself to wait; sostealthily he snatched a joss-stick and set fire to it. A sound of'pu-ch'ih' was heard. The whole number of spectators laughedboisterously and withdrew. The persons, who carried the cracker, felt agrudge against the cracker-seller for not having made it tight, (andwondered) how it was that every one had left without hearing it go off."
"Is it likely that the men themselves didn't hear the report?"Hsiang-yuen insinuated.
"Why, the men themselves were deaf," lady Feng rejoined.
After listening to her, they pondered for a while, and then suddenlythey laughed aloud in chorus. But remembering that her first story hadbeen left unfinished, they inquired of her: "What was, after all, theissue of the first story? You should conclude that too."
Lady Feng gave a rap on the table with her hand. "How vexatious youare!" she exclaimed. "Well, the next day was the sixteenth; so thefestivities of the year were over, and the feast itself was past andgone. I see people busy putting things away, and fussing about still, sohow can I make out what will be the end of it all?"
At this, one and all indulged in renewed merriment.
"The fourth watch has long ago been struck outside," lady Feng smilinglysaid. "From what I can see, our worthy senior is also tired out; and weshould, like when the cracker was let off in that story of the deafpeople, be bundling ourselves off and finish!"
Mrs. Yu and the rest covered their mouths with their handkerchiefs andlaughed. Now they stooped forward; and now they bent backward. Andpointing at her, "This thing," they cried, "has really a mean tongue."
Old lady Chia laughed. "Yes," she said, "this vixen Feng has, in realtruth, developed a meaner tongue than ever! But she alluded tocrackers," she added, "so let's also let off a few fireworks so as tocounteract the fumes of the wine."
Chia Jung overheard the suggestion. Hurriedly leaving the room, he tookthe pages with him, and having a scaffolding erected in the court, theyhung up the fireworks, and got everything in perfect readiness. Thesefireworks were articles of tribute, sent from different states, andwere, albeit not large in size, contrived with extreme ingenuity. Therepresentations of various kinds of events of antiquity were perfect,and in them were inserted all sorts of crackers.
Lin Tai-yue was naturally of a weak disposition, so she could not standthe report of any loud intonation. Her grandmother Chia thereforeclasped her immediately in her embrace. Mrs. Hsueeh, meanwhile, tookHsiang-yuen in her arms.
"I'm not afraid," smiled Hsiang-yuen.
"Nothing she likes so much as letting off huge crackers," Pao-ch'aismilingly interposed, "and could she fear this sort of thing?"
Madame Wang, thereupon, laid hold of Pao-yue, and pulled him in her lap.
"We've got no one to care a rap for us," lady Feng laughed.
"I'm here for you," Mrs. Yu rejoined with a laugh. "I'll embrace you.There you're again behaving like a spoilt child. You've heard aboutcrackers, and you comport yourself as if you'd had honey to eat! You'requite frivolous again to-day!"
"Wait till we break up," lady Feng answered laughing, "and we'll go andlet some off in our garden. I can fire them far better than any of theyoung lads!"
While they bandied words, one kind of firework after another was lightedoutside, and then later on some more again. Among these figured'fill-heaven-stars;' 'nine dragons-enter-clouds;' 'over-whole-land-a-crack-of-thunder;' 'fly-up-heavens;' 'sound-ten shots,' and other suchsmall crackers.
The fireworks over, the young actresses were again asked to render the'Lotus-flowers-fall,' and cash were strewn upon the stage. The younggirls bustled all over the boards, snatching cash and capering about.
The soup was next brought. "The night is long," old lady Chia said, "andsomehow or other I feel peckish."
"There's some congee," lady Feng promptly remarked, "prepared withduck's meat."
"I'd rather have plain things," dowager lady Chia answered.
"There's also some congee made with non-glutinous rice and powder ofdates. It's been cooked for the ladies who fast."
"If there's any of this, it will do very well," old lady Chia replied.
While she spoke, orders were given to remove the remnants of thebanquet, and inside as well as outside; were served every kind of_recherche_ small dishes. One and all then partook of some of theserefreshments, at their pleasure, and rinsing their mouths with tea, theyafterwards parted.
On the seventeenth, they also repaired, at an early hour, to the Ningmansion to present their compliments; and remaining in attendance, whilethe doors of the ancestral hall were closed and the images put away,they, at length, returned to their quarters.
Invitations had been issued on this occasion to drink the new year wineat Mrs. Hsueeh's residence. But dowager lady Chia had been out on severalconsecutive days, and so tired out did she feel that she withdrew to herrooms, after only a short stay.
After the eighteenth, relatives and friends arrived and made theirformal invitations; or else they came as guests to the banquets given.But so little was old lady Chia in a fit state to turn her mind toanything that the two ladies, Madame Hsing and lady Feng, had to attendbetween them to everything that cropped up. But Pao-yue as well did notgo anywhere else than to Wang Tzu-t'eng's, and the excuse he gave outwas that his grandmother kept him at home to dispel her ennui.
We need not, however, dilate on irrelevant details. In due course, thefestival of the fifteenth of the first moon passed. But, reader, if youhave any curiosity to learn any subsequent events, listen to those givenin the chapter below.

CHAPTER LV.
  The stupid secondary wife, dame Chao, needlessly loses her temper and      insults her own daughter, T'an Ch'un.  The perverse servant-girls are so full of malice that they look down      contemptuously on their youthful mistresses.
We will now resume our narration with the Jung Mansion. Soon after thebustle of the new year festivities, lady Feng who, with the most arduousduties she had had to fulfil both before and after the new year, hadfound little time to take proper care of herself, got a miscarriage andcould not attend to the management of domestic affairs. Day after daytwo and three doctors came and prescribed for her. But lady Feng hadever accustomed herself to be hardy, so although unable to go out ofdoors, she nevertheless devised the ways and means for everything, andmade the various arrangements she deemed necessary, and whatever concernsuggested itself to her mind, she entrusted to P'ing Erh to lay beforeMadame Wang. But however much people advised her to be careful, shewould not lend an ear to them. Madame Wang felt as if she had beendeprived of her right arm. And as she alone had not sufficient energy tosee to everything, she bestowed her own attention upon such importantaffairs, as turned up, and entrusted, for the time being, allmiscellaneous domestic matters to the co-operation of Li Wan.
Li Wan had at all times held virtue at a high price, and set but littlevalue on talents of any kind, so that she, as a matter of course,displayed leniency to those who were placed under her. Madame Wangaccordingly bade T'an Ch'un combine with Li Wan in the management of thehousehold. "In a month," she argued, "lady Feng will be getting allright again, and then you can once more hand over charge to her."
Little, however, though one would think it, lady Feng was endowed with apoor physique. From her youth up, moreover, she had not known how tohusband her health; and emulation and contentiousness had, more thananything else, combined to undermine her vital energies. Hence it wasthat although her complaint was a simple miscarriage, it had really,after all, been the outcome of loss of vigour. After a month symptoms ofemissions of blood began also to show themselves. And notwithstandingher reluctance to utter what she felt every one, at the sight of hersallow and emaciated face, readily concluded that she was not nursingherself as well as she should.
Madame Wang therefore enjoined her merely to take her medicines and lookto herself with due care; and she would not allow her to disquiet hermind about the least thing. But (lady Feng) herself also gave way tomisgivings lest her illness should assume some grave phase, and muchthough she laughed with one and all, she was ever mindful to steal timeto attend to her health, feeling inwardly vexed at not being able tosoon get back her old strength again. But she had, as it happened, todose herself with medicines and to nurse herself for three whole months,before she gradually began to rally and before the discharges stopped bydegrees. But we will abstain from any reference to these details whichpertain to the future, suffice it now to add that though Madame Wangnoticed her improved state, (she thought it) impossible for the timebeing for T'an Ch'un and Li Wan to resign their charge. But so fidgettywas she lest with the large number of inmates in the garden propercontrol should not be exercised that she specially sent for Pao-ch'aiand begged of her to keep an eye over every place, explaining to herthat the old matrons were of no earthly use, for whenever they couldobtain any leisure, they drank and gambled; and slept during broaddaylight, while they played at cards during the hours of night. "I knowall about their doings," (she said). "When that girl Feng is well enoughto go out, they have some little fear. But they're bound at present toconsult again their own convenience. Yet you, dear child, are one inwhom I can repose complete trust. Your brother and your female cousinsare, on the one hand, young; and I can, on the other, afford no sparetime; so do exert yourself on my behalf for a couple of days, andexercise proper supervision. And should anything unexpected turn up,just come and tell it to me. Don't wait until our old lady inquiresabout it, as I shall then find myself in a corner with nothing to say inmy defence. If those servants aren't on their good behaviour, mind youblow them up; and if they don't listen to you, come and lay yourcomplaint before me; for it will be best not to let anything assume aserious aspect."
Pao-ch'ai listened to her appeal and felt under the necessity ofvolunteering to undertake the charge.
The season was about the close of spring, so Tai-yue got her cough backagain. But Hsiang-yuen was likewise laid up in the Heng Wu Yuean, as shetoo was affected by the weather, and day after day she saw numberlessdoctors and took endless medicines.
T'an Ch'un and Li Wan lived apart, but as they had of late assumed jointmanagement of affairs, it was, unlike former years, extremelyinconvenient even for the servants to go backwards and forwards to maketheir reports. They consequently resolved that they should meet earlyevery day in the small three-roomed reception-hall, at the south side ofthe garden gate, to transact what business there was, and that theirmorning meal over, they should after noon return again to theirquarters.
This three-roomed hall had originally been got ready at the time of thevisit of the imperial consort to her parents, to accommodate theattendants and eunuchs. This visit over, it proved, therefore, no longerof use, and the old matrons simply came to it every night to keep watch.But mild weather had now set in, and any complete fittings were quitesuperfluous. All that could be seen about amounted to a few small piecesof furniture just sufficient for them to make themselves comfortablewith. Over this hall was likewise affixed a placard, with theinscription in four characters:
  "Perfected philanthropy, published virtue!"
Yet the place was generally known among the domestics as 'thediscuss-matters-hall.' To this hall, (Li Wan and T'an Ch'un) would dailyadjourn at six in the morning, and leave it at noon, and the wives ofthe managers and other servants, who had any matters to lay before them,came and went in incessant strings.
When the domestics heard that Li Wan would assume sole control, each andall felt secretly elated; for as Li Wan had always been considerate,forbearing and loth to inflict penalties, she would be, of course, theythought, easier to put off than lady Feng. Even when T'an Ch'un wasadded, they again remembered that she was only a youthful unmarried girland that she too had ever shown herself goodnatured and kindly to adegree, so none of them worried their minds about her, and they becameconsiderably more indolent than when they had to deal with lady Feng.But after the expiry of three or four days several concerns passedthrough her hands, which gave them an opportunity to gradually find outthat T'an Ch'un did not, in smartness and thoroughness, yield to ladyFeng, and that the only difference between them was that she was soft inspeech and gentle in disposition. By a remarkable coincidence, princes,dukes, marquises, earls, and hereditary officials arrived forconsecutive days from various parts; all of whom were, if not therelatives of the Jung and Ning mansions, at least their old friends.There were either those who had obtained transfers on promotion, orothers who had been degraded; either those, who had married, or thosewho had gone into mourning, and Madame Wang had so much congratulatingand condoling, receiving and escorting to do that she had no time toattend to any entertaining. There was therefore less than ever any onein the front part to look after things. So while (T'an Ch'un and Li Wan)spent their whole days in the hall, Pao-ch'ai tarried all day in thedrawing-rooms, to keep an eye over what was going on; and they onlybetook themselves back to their quarters after Madame Wang's return. Ofa night, they whiled away their leisure hours by doing needlework; butthey would, previous to retiring to sleep, get into their chairs, and,taking along with them the servants, whose duty it was to be on nightwatch in the garden, and other domestics as well, they visited eachplace on their round. Such was the control exercised by these threeinmates that signs were not wanting to prove that greater severity wasobserved than in the days when the management devolved on lady Feng. Tothis reason must be assigned the fact that all the servants attachedinside as well as outside cherished a secret grudge against them. "Nosooner," they insinuated, "has one patrolling ogre come than they addthree more cerberean sort of spring josses so that even at night we'vegot less time than ever to sip a cup of wine and indulge in a romp!"
On the day that Madame Wang was going to a banquet at the mansion of theMarquis of Chin Hsiang, Li Wan and T'an Ch'un arranged their coiffureand performed their ablutions at an early hour; and after waiting uponher until she went out of doors, they repaired into the hall andinstalled themselves in their seats. But just as they were sipping theirtea, they espied Wu Hsin-teng's wife walk in. "Mrs. Chao's brother, ChaoKuo-chi," she observed, "departed this life yesterday; the tidings havealready been reported to our old mistress and our lady, who said that itwas all right, and bade me tell you, Miss."
At the close of this announcement, she respectfully dropped her armsagainst her body, and stood aloof without adding another word. Theservants, who came at this season to lay their reports before (T'anCh'un and Li Wan), mustered no small number. But they all endeavoured tofind out how their two new mistresses ran the household; for as longthey managed things properly, one and all willingly resolved to respectthem, but in the event of the least disagreement or improper step, notonly did they not submit to them, but they also spread, the moment theyput their foot outside the second gate, numberless jokes on theiraccount and made fun of them. Wu Hsin-teng's wife had thus devised anexperiment in her own mind. Had she had to deal with lady Feng, shewould have long ago made an attempt to show off her zeal by proposingnumerous alternatives and discovering various bygone precedents, andthen allowed lady Feng to make her own choice and take action; but, inthis instance, she looked with such disdain on Li Wan, on account of hersimplicity, and on T'an Ch'un, on account of her youthfulness, that shevolunteered only a single sentence, in order to put both these ladies tothe test, and see what course they would be likely to adopt.
"What shall we do?" T'an Ch'un asked Li Wan.
Li Wan reflected for a while. "The other day," she rejoined, "that HsiJen's mother died, I heard that she was given forty taels. So now giveher forty taels as well and have done!"
Upon hearing this proposal, Wu Hsin-teng's wife eagerly expressed heracquiescence, by uttering a yes; and taking over the permit she wasgoing on her way at once.
"Come back," shouted T'an Ch'un.
"Wu Hsing-teng's wife had perforce to retrace her footsteps.
"Wait, don't get the money yet," T'an Ch'un remarked. "I want to ask yousomething. Some of the old secondary wives, attached years back to ourvenerable senior's rooms, lived inside the establishment; othersoutside; there were these two distinctions between them. Now if any ofthem died at home, how much was allowed them? And how much was allottedto such as died outside? Tell us what was given in either case for ourguidance."
As soon as Wu Hsin-teng's wife was asked this question, every detailbearing on the subject slipped from her memory. Hastily forcing a smile,"This is," she replied, "nothing of any such great consequence. Whethermuch or little be allowed, who'll ever venture to raise a quarrel aboutit?"
T'an Ch'un then smiled. "This is all stuff and nonsense!" she exclaimed."My idea is that it would be better to give a hundred taels. For if wedon't comply with what's right, we shall, not to speak of yourridiculing us, find it also a hard job by and bye to face your mistressSecunda."
"Well, in that case," laughed Wu Hsin-teng's wife, "I'll go and look upthe old accounts. I can't recollect anything about them just at thismoment."
"You're quite an old hand in the management of affairs," T'an Ch'unobserved with a significant smile, "and can't you remember, but comeinstead to perplex us? Whenever you've had anything of the kind to laybefore your lady Secunda, have you also had to go first and look it up?But if this has been the practice, lady Feng can't be looked upon asbeing such a dreadful creature. One could very well call her lenient andkind. Yet don't you yet hurry to go and hunt them up and bring them tome to see? If we dilly-dally another day, they won't run you people downfor your coarse-mindedness, but we will seem to have been driven to ourwits' ends!"
Wu Hsin-teng's wife got quite scarlet in the face. Promptly twistingherself round, she quitted the hall; while the whole bevy of marriedwomen stretched out their tongues significantly.
During her absence, other matters were reported. But in a little while,Wu Hsin-teng's wife returned with the old accounts. On inspection, T'anCh'un found that for a couple of secondary wives, who had lived in theestablishment, twenty-four taels had been granted, and that for two,whose quarters had been outside, forty taels had in each case beenallowed. Besides these two, others were mentioned, who had lived outsidethe mansion; to one of whom a hundred taels had been given, and to theother, sixty taels. Under these two records, the reasons were assigned.In the one case, the coffins of father and mother had had to be removedfrom another province, and sixty taels extra had consequently beengranted. In the other, an additional twenty taels had been allowed, as aburial-place had to be purchased at the time.
T'an Ch'un handed the accounts to Li Wan for her perusal.
"Give her twenty taels," readily suggested T'an Ch'un. "Leave theseaccounts here for us to examine minutely."
Wu Hsin-teng's wife then walked away. But unexpectedly Mrs. Chao enteredthe hall. Li Wan and T'an Ch'un speedily pressed her to take a seat.
Mrs. Chao then broke the silence. "All the inmates of these rooms havetrampled me under heel," she said, "but never mind! Yet, my child, justponder, it is only fair that you should take my part."
While ventilating her grievances, her eyes got moist, her nose watered,and she began to sob.
"To whom are you alluding Mrs. Chao?" T'an Ch'un hastily inquired. "Ican't really make out what you're driving at. Who tramples you underfoot? Speak out and I'll take up your cudgels."
"You're now trampling me down yourself, young lady," Mrs. Chao observed."And to whom can I go and tell my grievance?"
T'an Ch'un, at these words, jumped up with alacrity. "I never wouldpresume to do any such thing," she protested.
Li Wan too vehemently sprung to her feet to proffer her some goodcounsel.
"Pray seat yourselves, both of you," Mrs. Chao cried, "and listen towhat I have to say. I've had, like simmering oil, to consume away inthese rooms to this advanced age. There's also your brother besides. YetI can't compare myself now even to Hsi Jen, and what credit do I enjoy?But you haven't as well any face, so don't let's speak of myself."
"It was really on account of this," T'an Ch'un smiled, "that I said thatI didn't presume to disregard right and to violate propriety."
While she spoke, she resumed her seat, and taking up the accounts, sheturned them over for Mrs. Chao to glance at, after which she read themout to her for her edification. "These are old customs," she proceeded,"enforced by the seniors of the family, and every one complies withthem, and could I ever, pray, have changed them? These will hold goodnot only with Hsi Jen; but even when by and bye Huan-erh takes aconcubine, the same course will naturally be adopted as in the case ofHsi Jen. This is no question for any large quarrels or small disputes,and no mention should be made about face or no face. She's our MadameWang's servant-girl, and I've dealt with her according to along-standing precedent. Those who say that I've taken suitable actionwill come in for our ancestors' bounty and our lady's bounty as well.But should any one uphold that I've adopted an unfair course, thatperson is devoid of all common sense and totally ignorant of what ablessing means. The only thing she can do is to foster as muchresentment as she chooses. Our lady, Madame Wang, may even give apresent of a house to any one; what credit is that to me? Again, she maynot give a single cash, but even that won't imply any loss of face, asfar as I am concerned. What I have to say is that as Madame Wang is awayfrom home, you should quietly look after yourself a bit. What's the goodof worrying and fretting? Our lady is extremely fond of me; and, if, atdifferent times, a chilliness has sprung up on her part, it's becauseyou, Mrs. Chao, have again and again been officious. Had I been a manand able to have gone abroad, I would long ago have run away and startedsome business. I would then have had something of my own to attend to.But, as it happens, I am a girl, so that I can't even recklessly utterso much as a single remark. Madame Wang is well aware of it in herheart. And it's now because she entertains a high opinion of me that sherecently bade me assume the charge of domestic affairs. But before I'vehad time enough to do a single good act, here you come, Mrs. Chao, tolay down the law. If this reaches Madame Wang's ear, I fear I shall getinto trouble. She won't let me exercise any control, and then I shall,in real earnest, come in for no face. But even you, Mrs. Chao, will thenactually lose countenance."
Reasoning with her, she so little could repress her tears that theyrolled down her cheeks.
Mrs. Chao had not a word more to say to refute her arguments with. "IfMadame Wang loves you," she simply responded, "there's still more reasonwhy you should have drawn us into her favour. (Instead of that), all youthink about is to try and win Madame Wang's affections, and you forgetall about us."
"How ever did I forget you?" T'an Ch'un exclaimed. "How would you haveme drag you into favour? Go and ask every one of them, and you'll seewhat mistress is indifferent to any one, who exerts her energies andmakes herself useful, and what worthy person requires being drawn intofavour?"
Li Wan, who stood by, did her best to pacify them with her advice. "Mrs.Chao," she argued, "don't lose your temper! Neither should you feel anyill-will against this young lady of yours. Had she even at heart everygood intention to lend you a hand, how could she put it into words?"
"This worthy senior dame," T'an Ch'un impatiently interposed, "has alsogrown quite dense! Whom could I drag into favour? Why, in what family,do the young ladies give a lift to slave-girls? Their qualities as wellas defects should all alike be well known to you people. And what havethey got to do with me?"
Mrs. Chao was much incensed. "Who tells you," she asked, "to give a liftto any one? Were it not that you looked after the house, I wouldn't havecome to inquire anything of you. But anything you may suggest is right;so had you, now that your maternal uncle is dead, granted twenty orthirty taels in excess, is it likely that Madame Wang would not havegiven you her consent? It's evident that our Madame Wang is a good womanand that it's you people who are mean and stingy. Unfortunately,however, her ladyship has with all her bounty no opportunity ofexercising it. You could, my dear girl, well set your mind at ease. Youwouldn't, in this instance, have had to spend any of your own money; andat your marriage by and bye, I would still have borne in mind theexceptional regard you had shown the Chao family. But now that you'vegot your full plumage, you've forgotten your extraction, and chosen alofty branch to fly to."
Before T'an Ch'un had heard her to the end, she flew into such a ragethat her face blanched; and choking for breath, she gasped and panted.Sobbing, she asked the while: "Who's my maternal uncle? My maternaluncle was at the end of the year promoted to be High Commissioner of theNine Provinces! How can another maternal uncle have cropped up? It'sbecause I've ever shown that reverence enjoined by the rites that otherrelatives have now more than ever turned up. If what you say be thecase, how is it that every day that Huan-erh goes out, Chao Kuo-chi toostands up, and follows him to school? Why doesn't he put on the airs ofan uncle? What's the reason that he doesn't? Who isn't aware of the factthat I'm born of a concubine? Would it require two or three months' timeto trace my extraction? But the fact is you've come to kick up all thishullaballoo for fear lest people shouldn't be alive to the truth; andwith the express design of making it public all over the place! But Iwonder who of us two will make the other lose face? Luckily, I've got mywits about me; for had I been a stupid creature ignorant of goodmanners, I would long ago have lost all patience."
Li Wan was much concerned, but she had to continue to exhort them todesist. But Mrs. Chao proceeded with a long rigmarole until a servantwas unexpectedly heard to report that lady Secunda had sent Miss Ping todeliver a message. Mrs. Chao caught the announcement, and eventuallyheld her peace, when they espied P'ing erh making her appearance. Mrs.Chao hastily forced a saturnine smile, and motioned to her to take aseat. "Is your lady any better?" she went on to inquire with vehemence."I was just thinking of going to look her up; but I could find noleisure!"
Upon seeing P'ing Erh enter, Li Wan felt prompted to ask her the objectof her visit.
"My lady says," P'ing Erh smilingly responded, "that she apprehends, nowthat Mrs. Chao's brother is dead, that your ladyship and you, miss, arenot aware of the existence of an old precedent. According to theordinary practice no more need be given than twenty taels; but she nowrequests you, miss, to consider what would be best to do; if even youadd a good deal more, it will do well enough."
T'an Ch'un at once wiped away all traces of tears. "What's the use ofanother addition, when there's no valid reason for it?" she promptlydemurred. "Who has again been twenty months in the womb? Or is itforsooth any one who's gone to the wars, and managed to escape with hislife, carrying his master on his back? Your mistress is certainly veryingenious! She tells me to disregard the precedent, in order that sheshould pose as a benefactress! She wishes to take the money, whichMadame Wang spurns, so as to reap the pleasure of conferring favours!Just you tell her that I could not presume to add or reduce anything, oreven to adopt any reckless decision. Let her add what she wants and makea display of bounty. When she gets better and is able to come out, shecan effect whatever additions she fancies."
The moment P'ing Erh arrived, she obtained a fair insight (into ladyFeng's designs), so when she heard the present remarks, she grasped astill more correct idea of things. But perceiving an angry look aboutT'an Ch'un's face, she did not have the temerity to behave towards heras she would, had she found her in the high spirits of past days. Allshe did therefore was to stand aloof with her arms against her sides andto wait in rigid silence. Just at that moment, however, Pao-ch'aidropped in, on her return from the upper rooms. T'an Ch'un quickly roseto her feet, and offered her a seat. But before they had had time toexchange any words, a married woman likewise came to report somebusiness.
But as T'an Ch'un had been having a good cry, three or four young maidsbrought her a basin, towel, and hand-glass and other articles oftoilette. T'an Ch'un was at the moment seated cross-legged, on a lowwooden couch, so the maid with the basin had, when she drew near, todrop on both her knees and lift it high enough to bring it within reach.The other two girls prostrated themselves next to her and handed thetowels and the rest of the toilet things, which consisted of alooking-glass, rouge and powder. But P'ing Erh noticed that Shih Shu wasnot in the room, and approaching T'an Ch'un with hasty step, she tuckedup her sleeves for her and unclasped her bracelets. Seizing also a largetowel from the hands of one of the maids, she covered the lapel on thefront part of T'an Ch'un's dress; whereupon T'an Ch'un put out herhands, and washed herself in the basin.
"My lady and miss," the married woman observed, "may it please you topay what has been spent in the family school for Mr. Chia Huan and Mr..Chia Lan during the year."
P'ing Erh was the first to speak. "What are you in such a hurry for?"she cried. "You've got your eyes wide open, and must be able to see ouryoung lady washing her face; instead of coming forward to wait on her,you start talking! Do you also behave in this blind sort of way in thepresence of your lady Secunda? This young lady is, it's true, generousand lenient, but I'll go and report you to your mistress. I'll simplytell her that you people have no eye for Miss T'an Ch'un. But when youfind yourselves in a mess, don't bear me any malice."
At this hint the woman took alarm, and hastily forcing a smile, shepleaded guilty. "I've been rude," she exclaimed. With these words, sherushed with all despatch out of the room.
T'an Ch'un smoothed her face. While doing so, she turned herself towardsP'ing Erh and gave her a cynical smile. "You've come just one step toolate," she remarked. "You weren't in time to see something laughable!Even sister Wu, an old hand at business though she be, failed to look upclearly an old custom and came to play her tricks on us. But when weplied her with questions, she luckily had the face to admit that it hadslipped from her memory. 'Do you,' I insinuated, 'also forget, whenyou've got anything to report to lady Secunda? and have you subsequentlyto go and hunt up all about it?' Your mistress can't, I fancy, be sopatient as to wait while she goes and institutes proper search."
P'ing Erh laughed. "Were she to have behaved but once in this wise," sheobserved, "I feel positive that a couple of the tendons of her legswould have long ago been snapped. But, Miss, don't credit all they say.It's because they see that our senior mistress is as sweet-tempered as a'P'u-sa,' and that you, miss, are a modest young lady, that they,naturally, shirk their duties and come and take liberties with you. Yourmind is set upon playing the giddy dogs," continuing, she added;speaking towards those beyond the doorway; "but when your mistress getsquite well again, we'll tell her all."
"You're gifted with the greatest perspicacity, miss," the married women,standing outside the door, smiled in chorus. "The proverb says: 'theperson who commits a fault must be the one to suffer.' We don't in anyway presume to treat any mistress with disdain. Our mistress at presentis in delicate health, and if we intentionally provoke her, may we, whenwe die, have no place to have our corpses interred in."
P'ing Erh laughed a laugh full irony. "So long as you're aware of this,it's well and good," she said. And smiling a saturnine smile, sheresumed, addressing herself to T'an Ch'un: "Miss, you know very well howbusy our lady has been and how little she could afford the time to keepthis tribe of people in order. Of course, they couldn't therefore, beprevented from becoming remiss. The adage has it: 'Lookers-on are clearof sight!' During all these years that you, have looked ondispassionately, there have possibly been instances on which, thoughadditions or reductions should have been made, our lady Secunda has notbeen able to effect them, so, miss, do add or curtail whatever you maydeem necessary, in order that, first, Madame Wang may be benefited, andthat, secondly, you mayn't too render nugatory the kindness with whichyou ever deal towards our mistress."
But scarcely had she finished, than Pao-ch'ai and Li Wan smilinglyinterposed. "What a dear girl!" they ejaculated. "One really can't feelangry with that hussy Feng for being partial to her and fond of her. Wedidn't, at first, see how we could very well alter anything by anyincrease or reduction, but after what you've told us, we must hit uponone or two things and try and devise means to do something, with a viewof not showing ourselves ungrateful of the advice you've tendered us."
"My heart was swelling with indignation," T'an Ch'un observed laughing,"and I was about to go and give vent to my temper with her mistress, butnow that she (P'ing Erh) has happened to come, she has, with a fewwords, quite dissuaded me from my purpose."
While she spoke, she called the woman, who had been with them a fewminutes back, to return into the room. "For what things for Mr. ChiaHuan and Mr. Chia Lau was the money expended during the year in thefamily school?" she inquired of her.
"For cakes," replied the woman, "they ate during the year at school; orfor the purchase of paper and pens. Each one of them is allowed eighttaels."
"The various expenses on behalf of the young men," T'an Ch'un added,"are invariably paid in monthly instalments to the respectivehouseholds. For cousin Chia Huan's, Mrs. Chao receives two taels. ForPao-yue's, Hsi Jen draws two taels from our venerable senior's suite ofapartments. For cousin Chia Lan's, some one, in our senior lady's rooms,gets the proper allowance. So how is it that these extra eight taelshave to be disbursed at school for each of these young fellows? Is itreally for these eight taels that they go to school? But from this dayforth I shall put a stop to this outlay. So P'ing Erh, when you getback, tell your mistress that I say that this item must absolutely bedone away with."
"This should have been done away with long ago," P'ing Erh smiled. "Lastyear our lady expressed her intention to eliminate it, but with theendless things that claimed her attention about the fall of the year,she forgot all about it."
The woman had no other course than to concur with her views and to walkaway. But the married women thereupon arrived from the garden of BroadVista with the boxes of eatables. So Shih Shu and Su Yuen at once broughta small dining-table, and P'ing Erh began to fuss about laying theviands on it.
"If you've said all you had," T'an Ch'un laughed, "you'd better be offand attend to your business. What's the use of your bustling abouthere?"
"I've really got nothing to do," P'ing Erh answered smiling. "Our ladySecunda sent me first, to deliver a message; and next, because shefeared that the servants in here weren't handy enough. The fact is, shebade me come and help the girls wait on you, my lady, and on you, miss."
"Why don't you bring Mrs. Pao's meal so that she should have it alongwith us?" T'an Ch'un then inquired.
As soon as the waiting-maids heard her inquiry, they speedily rushed outand went under the eaves. "Go," they cried, directing the married women,"and say that Miss Pao-ch'ai would like to have her repast just now inthe hall along with the others, and tell them to send the eatableshere."
T'an Ch'un caught their directions. "Don't be deputing people to go onreckless errands!" she vociferated. "Those are dames, who manageimportant matters and look after the house, and do you send them to askfor eatables and inquire about tea? You haven't even the least notionabout gradation. P'ing Erh is standing here, so tell her to go and givethe message."
P'ing Erh immediately assented, and issued from the room, bent upongoing on the errand. But the married women stealthily pulled her back."How could you, miss, be made to go and tell them?" they smiled. "We'vegot some one here, who can do so!"
So saying, they dusted one of the stone steps with their handkerchiefs."You've been standing so long," they observed, "that you must feel quitetired. Do sit in this sunny place and have a little rest."
P'ing Erh took a seat on the step. Two matrons attached to the tea-roomthen fetched a rug and spread it out for her. "It's cold on thosestones," they ventured; "this is, as clean as it can be. So, miss, domake the best of it, and use it!"
P'ing Erh hastily forced a smile. "Many thanks," she replied.
Another matron next brought her a cup of fine new tea. "This isn't thetea we ordinarily drink," she quietly smiled. "This is really forentertaining the young ladies with. Miss, pray moisten your mouth withsome."
P'ing Erh lost no time in bending her body forward and taking the cup.Then pointing at the company of married women, she observed in a lowvoice: "You're all too fond of trouble! The way you're going on won't doat all! She (T'an Ch'un) is only a young girl, so she is loth to showany severity, or display any temper. This is because she's full ofrespect. Yet you people look down on her and insult her. Should she,however, be actually provoked into any violent fit of anger, people willsimply say that her behaviour was rather rough, and all will be over.But as for you, you'll get at once into endless trouble. Even though shemight show herself somewhat wilful, Madame Wang treats her withconsiderable forbearance, and lady Secunda too hasn't the courage tomeddle with her; and do you people have such arrogance as to look downon her? This is certainly just as if an egg were to go and bang itselfagainst a stone!"
"When were we ever so audacious?" the servants exclaimed with one voice."This fuss is all the work of Mrs. Chao!"
"Never mind about that!" P'ing Erh urged again in an undertone. "My dearladies, 'when a wall falls, every one gives it a shove.' That Mrs. Chaohas always been rather topsy-turvey in her ways, and done things byhalves; so whenever there has been any rumpus, you've invariably shovedthe blame on to her shoulders. Never have you had any regard for anysingle person. Your designs are simply awful! Is it likely that allthese years that I've been here, I haven't come to know of them? Had ourlady Secunda mismanaged things just a little bit, she would have longago been run down by every one of you, ladies! Even such as she is, youwould, could you only get the least opportunity, be ready to place herin a fix! And how many, many times hasn't she been abused by you?"
"She's dreadful," one and all of them rejoined. "You all live in fearand trembling of her. But we know well enough that no one could say thatshe too does not in the depths of her heart entertain some little dreadfor the lot of you. The other day, we said, in talking matters over,that things could not go on smoothly from beginning to end, and thatsome unpleasantness was bound to happen. Miss Tertia is, it's true, amere girl, and you've always treated her with little consideration, butout of that company of senior and junior young ladies, she is the onlysoul whom our lady Secunda funks to some certain extent. And yet youpeople now won't look up to her."
So speaking Ch'iu Wen appeared to view. The married women ran up to herand inquired after her health. "Miss," they said, "do rest a little.They've had their meal served in there, so wait until things have beencleared away, before you go and deliver your message."
"I'm not like you people," Ch'iu Wen smiled. "How can I afford to wait?"
With these words on her lips, she was about to go into the hall, whenP'ing Erh quickly called her back. Ch'iu Wen, upon turning her headround, caught sight of P'ing Erh. "Have you too," she remarked with asmile, "come here to become something like those guardians postedoutside the enclosing walls?"
Retracing, at the same time, her footsteps, she took a seat on the rug,occupied by P'ing Erh.
"What message have you got to deliver?" P'ing Erh gently asked.
"I've got to ask when we can get Pao-yue's monthly allowance and our owntoo," she responded.
"Is this any such pressing matter?" P'ing Erh answered. "Go back quick,and tell Hsi Jen that my advice is that no concern whatever should bebrought to their notice to-day. That every single matter reported isbound to be objected to; and that even a hundred will just as surely bevetoed."
"Why is it?" vehemently inquired Ch'iu Wen, upon hearing thisexplanation.
P'ing Erh and the other servants then promptly told her the variousreasons. "She's just bent," they proceeded, "upon finding a few weightyconcerns in order to establish, at the expense of any decent person whomight chance to present herself, a precedent of some kind or other so asto fix upon a mode of action, which might help to put down expenses totheir proper level, and afford a lesson to the whole household; and whyare you people the first to come and bump your heads against the nails?If you went now and told them your errand, it would also reflectdiscredit upon our venerable old mistress and Madame Wang, were they topounce upon one or two matters to make an example of you. But if theycomplied with one or two of your applications, others will againmaintain 'that they are inclined to favour this one and show partialityto that one; that as you had your old mistress' and Madame Wang'sauthority to fall back upon, they were afraid and did not presume toprovoke their displeasure; that they only avail themselves ofsoft-natured persons to make scapegoats of.' Just mark my words! Sheeven means to raise objections in one or two matters connected with ourlady Secunda, in order to be the better able to shut up people'smouths."
Ch'iu Wen listened to her with patient ear; and then stretching out hertongue, "It's lucky enough you were here, sister P'ing," she smiled;"otherwise, I would have had my nose well rubbed on the ground. I shallseize the earliest opportunity and give the lot of them a hint."
While replying, she immediately rose to her feet and took leave of them.Soon after her departure, Pao-ch'ai's eatables arrived, and P'ing Erhhastened to enter and wait on her. By that time Mrs. Chao had left, sothe three girls seated themselves on the wooden bed, and went throughtheir repast. Pao-ch'ai faced the south. T'an Ch'un the west. Li Wan theeast. The company of married women stood quietly under the verandahready to answer any calls. Within the precincts of the chamber, onlysuch maids remained in waiting as had ever been their closestattendants. None of the other servants ventured, of their own accord, toput their foot anywhere inside.
The married women (meanwhile) discussed matters in a confidentialwhisper. "Let's do our downright best to save trouble," they argued."Don't let us therefore harbour any evil design, for even dame Wu will,in that case, be placed in an awkward fix. And can we boast of any grandhonours to expect to fare any better?"
While they stood on one side, and held counsel together, waiting for themeal to be over to make their several reports, they could not catch somuch as the caw of a crow inside the rooms. Neither did the clatter ofbowls and chopsticks reach their ears. But presently, they discerned amaid raise the frame of the portiere as high as she could, and two othergirls bring the table out. In the tea-room, three maids waited withthree basins in hand. The moment they saw the dining-table brought out,all three walked in. But after a brief interval, they egressed with thebasins and rinsing cups. Shih Shu, Su Yuen and Ying Erh thereupon enteredwith three covered cups of tea, placed in trays. Shortly however thesethree girls also made their exit. Shih Shu then recommended a young maidto be careful and attend to the wants (of their mistresses). "When we'vehad our rice," she added, "we'll come and relieve you. But don't gostealthily again and sit down!"
The married women at length delivered their reports in a quiet andorderly manner; and as they did not presume to be as contemptuous andoffhandish as they had been before, T'an Ch'un eventually cooled down.
"I've got something of moment," she then observed to P'ing Erh, "aboutwhich I would like to consult your mistress. Happily, I remembered itjust now, so come back as soon as you've had your meal. Miss Pao-ch'aiis also here at present, so, after we four have deliberated together,you can carefully ask your lady whether action is to be takenaccordingly or not."
P'ing Erh acquiesced and returned to her quarters. "How is it," inquiredlady Feng, "that you've been away such an age?"
P'ing Erh smiled and gave her a full account of what had recentlytranspired.
"What a fine, splendid girl Miss Tertia is!" she laughingly ejaculated."What I said was quite right! The only pity is that she should have hadsuch a miserable lot as not to have been born of a primary wife."
"My lady, you're also talking a lot of trash!" P'ing Erh smiled. "She,mayn't be Madame Wang's child, but is it likely that any one would be sobold as to point the finger of scorn at her, and not treat her like theothers?"
Lady Feng sighed. "How could you know everything?" she remarked. "Sheis, of course, the offspring of a concubine, but as a mere girl, shecan't be placed on the same footing as a man! By and bye, when any oneaspires to her hand, the sort of supercilious parties, who now tread theworld, will, as a first step, ask whether this young lady is the childof a No. 1 or No. 2 wife. And many of these won't have anything to sayto her, as she is the child, of a No. 2. But really people haven't anyidea that, not to speak of her as the offspring of a secondary wife, shewould be, even as a mere servant-girl of ours, far superior than thevery legitimate daughter of any family. Who, I wonder, will in thefuture be so devoid of good fortune as to break off the match; justbecause he may be inclined to pick and choose between a wife's child anda concubine's child? And who, I would like to know, will be that luckyfellow, who'll snatch her off without any regard to No. 1 and No. 2?"
Continuing, she resumed, turning smilingly towards P'ing Erh, "You knowwell enough how many ways and means I've had all these years to devisein order to effect retrenchment, and how there isn't, I may safely aver,a single soul in the whole household, who doesn't detest me behind myback. But now that I'm astride on the tiger's back, (I must go on; forif I put my foot on the ground, I shall be devoured). It's true, mytactics have been more or less seen through, but there's no help for it;I can't very well become more open-handed in a moment! In the secondplace, much goes out at home, and little comes in; and the hundred andone, large and small, things, which turn up, are still managed with thatmunificence so characteristic of our old ancestors. But the funds, thatcome in throughout the year, fall short of the immense sums of pastdays. And if I try again to effect any savings people will laugh at me,our venerable senior and Madame Wang suffer wrongs, and the servantsabhor me for my stinginess. Yet, if we don't seize the first opportunityto think of some plan for enforcing retrenchment, our means will, in thecourse of a few more years, be completely exhausted."
"Quite so!" assented P'ing Erh. "By and bye, there will be three or fourdaughters and two or three more sons added; and our old mistress won'tbe able, singlehanded, to meet all this heavy outlay."
"I myself entertain fears on the same score," lady Feng smiled. "But,after all, there will be ample. For when Pao-yue and cousin Lin getmarried, there won't be any need to touch a cent of public money, as ourold lady has her own private means, and she can well fork out some. MissSecunda is the child of your senior master yonder, and she too needn'tbe taken into account. So there only remain three or four, for each ofwhom one need only spend, at the utmost, ten thousand taels. Cousin Huanwill marry in the near future; and if an outlay of three thousand taelsprove insufficient, we will be able, by curtailing the bandoline, usedin those rooms for smoothing the hair with, make both ends meet. Andshould our worthy senior's end come about, provision for everything isalready made. All that we'll have to do will be to spend some small sumfor a few miscellaneous trifles; and three to five thousand taels willmore than suffice. So with further economies at present, there will beplenty for all our successive needs. The only fear is lest anythingoccur at an unforeseen juncture; for then it will be dreadful! But don'tlet us give way to apprehensions with regard to the future! You'd betterhave your rice; and when you've done, be quick and go and hear what theymean to treat about in their deliberations. I must now turn thisopportunity to the best account. I was only this very minute lamentingthat I had no help at my disposal. There's Pao-yue, it's true, but he toois made of the same stuff as the rest of them in here. Were I even toget him under my thumb, it would be of no earthly use whatever. Seniorlady is as good-natured as a joss; and she likewise is no good. MissSecunda is worse than useless. Besides, she doesn't belong to thisplace. Miss Quarta is only a child. That young fellow Lan and Huan-erhare, more than any of the others, like frozen kittens with frizzledcoats. They only wait to find some warm hole in a stove into which theymay poke themselves! Really from one and the same womb have been createdtwo human beings (T'an Ch'un and Chia Huan) so totally unlike each otheras the heavens are distant from the earth. But when I think of all this,I feel quite angry! Again, that girl Lin and Miss Pao are both deservingenough, but as they also happen to be our connexions, they couldn't verywell be put in charge of our family affairs. What's more, the oneresembles a lantern, decorated with nice girls, apt to spoil so soon asit is blown by a puff of wind. The other has made up her mind not toopen her month in anything that doesn't concern her. When she'squestioned about anything, she simply shakes her head, and repeatsthrice: 'I don't know,' so that it would be an extremely difficult jobto go and ask her to lend a helping hand. There's only therefore MissTertia, who is as sharp of mind as of tongue. She's besides astraightforward creature in this household of ours and Madame Wang isattached to her as well. It's true that she outwardly makes no displayof her feelings for her, but it's all that old thing Mrs. Chao, who hasdone the mischief, for, in her heart, she actually holds her as dear asshe does Pao-yue. She's such a contrast to Huan-erh! He truly makes ithard for any one to care a rap for him. Could I have had my own way, Iwould long ere this have packed him out of the place. But since she(T'au Ch'un) has now got this idea into her mind, we must cooperate withher. For if we can afford each other a helping hand, I too won't besingle-handed and alone. And as far as every right principle, eternalprinciple, and honesty of purpose go, we shall with such a person as ahelpmate, be able to save ourselves considerable anxiety, and MadameWang's interests will, on the other hand, derive every advantage. But,as far as unfairness and bad faith go, I've run the show with toomalicious a hand, and I must turn tail and draw back from my old ways.When I review what I've done, I find that if I still push my tyrannicalrule to the bitter end, people will hate me most relentlessly; so muchso, that under their smiles they'll harbour daggers, and much though wetwo may then be able to boast of having four eyes and two heads betweenus, they'll compass our ruin, when they can at any moment find us offour guard. We should therefore make the best of this crisis, so that assoon as she takes the initiative and sets things in order, all thattribe of people may for a time lose sight of the bitter feelings theycherish against us, for the way we've dealt with them in the past. Butthere's another thing besides. I naturally know the great talents youpossess, but I feel mistrust lest you should, by your own wits, not beable to bring things round. I enjoin these things then on you, now, foralthough a mere girl she has everything at her fingers' ends. The onlything is that she must try and be wary in speech. She's besides so muchbetter read than I am that she's a harder nut to crack. Now the proverbsays: 'in order to be able to catch the rebels, you must first catchtheir chief.' So if she's at present disposed to mature some plan andset to work to put it into practice, she'll certainly have to first andforemost make a start with me. In the event consequently of her raisingobjections to anything I've done, mind you don't begin any dispute withher. The more virulent she is in her censure of me, the more deferentialyou should be towards her. That's your best plan. And whatever you do,don't imagine that I'm afraid of any loss of face. But the moment youflare up with her, things won' go well......"
P'ing Erh did not allow her time to conclude her argument. "You're toomuch disposed to treat us as simpletons!" she smiled. "I've alreadycarried out your wishes, and do you now enjoin all these things on me?"
Lady Feng smiled. "It's because," she resumed, "I feared lest you, whohave your eyes and mouth so full of me, and only me, might be inclinedto show no regard whatever for her, that's why. I couldn't, therefore,but tender you the advice I did. But since you've already done what Iwanted you to do, you've shown yourself far sharper than I am. There'snothing in this to drive you into another tantrum, and to make thatmouth of yours begin to chatter away so much about 'you and I,' 'you andI' !"
"I've actually addressed you as 'you' ;" P'ing Erh rejoined; "but if yoube displeased at it, isn't this a case of a slap on the mouth? You canvery well give me another one, for is it likely that this phiz of minehasn't as yet tasted any, pray?"
"What a vixen you are!" lady Feng said smilingly. "How many faults willyou go on picking out, before you shut up? You see how ill I am, and yetyou come to rub me the wrong way. Come and sit down; for you and I canat all events have our meal together when there is no one to break inupon us. It's only right that we should."
While these remarks dropped from her lips, Feng Erh and some three orfour other maids entered the room and laid the small stove-couch table.Lady Feng only ate some birds' nests' soup and emptied two small platesof some recherche light viands; for she had long ago temporarily reducedher customary diet.
Feng Erh placed the four kinds of eatables allotted to P'ing Erh on thetable. After which, she filled a bowl of rice for her. Then with one legbent on the edge of the stove-couch, while the other rested on theground, P'ing Erh kept lady Feng company during her repast; and waitingon her, afterwards, until she finished rinsing her mouth, she issuedcertain directions to Feng Erh, and crossed over at length to T'anCh'un's quarters. Here she found the courtyard plunged in perfectstillness, for the various inmates, who had been assembled there, hadalready taken their leave.
But, reader, do you wish to follow up the story? If so, listen to thecircumstances detailed in the next chapter.

CHAPTER LVI.
  The clever T'an Ch'un increases their income and removes long-standing      abuses.  The worthy Pao-ch'ai preserves intact, by the display of a little      intelligence, the great reputation enjoyed by the Chia family.
But let us pick up the clue of our story. P'ing Erh bore lady Fengcompany during her meal; then attending to her, while she rinsed hermouth and washed her hands, she betook herself eventually to T'anCh'un's quarters, where she discovered the courtyard in perfectstillness. Not a soul was about beyond several maids, matrons and closeattendants of the inner rooms, who stood outside the windows on thealert to obey any calls. P'ing Erh stepped into the hall. The twocousins and their sister-in-law were all three engaged in discussingsome domestic affairs. They were talking about the feast, to which theyhad been invited during the new year festivities by Lai Ta's wife, andvarious details in connection with the garden she had in her place. Butas soon as she (P'ing Erh) appeared on the scene, T'an Ch'un desired herto seat herself on her footstool.
"What was exercising my mind," she thereupon observed, "confines itselfto this. I was computing that the head-oil, and rouge and powder, we useduring the course of a month, are also a matter of a couple of taels;and I was thinking that what with the sum of two taels, already allottedus every month, and the extra monthly amount given as well to the maids,allowances are, with the addition again of that of eight taels forschool expenses, we recently spoke about, piled to be sure one uponanother. The thing is, it's true, a mere trifle, and the amount only abagatelle, but it doesn't seem to be quite proper. But how is it thatyour mistress didn't take this into account?"
P'ing Erh smiled. "There's a why and a wherefore," she answered. "Allthe things required by you, young ladies, must absolutely be subject toa fixed rule; for the different compradores have to lay in a stock ofeach every month; and to send them to us by the maids to take charge of;but purely and simply to keep in readiness for you to use. No such thingcould ever be tolerated as that each of us should have to get moneyevery day and try and hunt up some one to go and buy these articles forus! That's how it is that the compradores outside receive a lump sum,and that they send us, month by month, by the female servants thesupplies allotted for the different rooms. As regards the two taelsmonthly allowed you, young ladies, they were not originally intendedthat you should purchase any such articles with, but that you should, ifat any time the ladies in charge of the household affairs happened to beaway from home or to have no leisure, be saved the trouble of having togo in search of the proper persons, in the event of your suddenlyfinding yourselves in need of money. This was done simply because it wasfeared that you would be subjected to inconvenience. But an unprejudicedglance about me now shows me that at least half of our young mistressesin the various quarters invariably purchase these things with readymoney of their own; so I can't help suspecting that, if it isn't aquestion of the compradores shirking their duties, it must be that whatthey buy is all mere rubbish."
T'an Ch'un and Li Wan laughed. "You must have kept a sharp lookout tohave managed to detect these things!" they said. "But as for shirkingthe purchases, they don't actually do so. It's simply that they'rebehind time by a good number of days. Yet when one puts on the screwwith them, they get some articles from somewhere or other, who knowswhere? These are however only a sham; for, in reality, they aren't fitfor use. But as they're now as ever obtained with cash down, a couple oftaels could very well be given to the brothers or sons of some of theother people's nurses to purchase them with. They'll then be good forsomething! Were we however to employ any of the public domestics in theestablishment, the things will be just as bad as ever. I wonder how theydo manage to get such utter rot as they do?"
"The purchases of the compradores may be what they are," P'ing Erhsmiled; "but were anyone else to buy any better articles, thecompradores themselves won't ever forgive them. Besides other things,they'll aver that they harbour evil designs, and that they wish todeprive them of their post. That's how it comes about that the servantswould much rather give offence to you all inside, (by getting inferiorthings), and that they have no desire to hurt the feelings of themanagers outside, (by purchasing anything of superior quality). But ifyou, young ladies, requisition the services of the nurses, these menwon't have the arrogance to make any nonsensical remarks."
"This accounts for the unhappy state my heart is in," T'an Ch'unobserved. "But as we're called upon to squander money right and left,and as the things purchased are half of them uselessly thrown away,wouldn't it, after all, be better for us to eliminate this monthlyallowance to the compradores? This is the first thing. The next I'd liketo ask you is this. When they went, during the new year festivities, toLai Ta's house, you also went with them; and what do think of that smallgarden as compared with this of ours?"
"It isn't half as big as ours," P'ing Erh laughingly explained. "Thetrees and plants are likewise fewer by a good deal."
"When I was having a chat with their daughter," T'an Ch'un proceeded,"she said that, besides the flowers they wear, and the bamboo shoots,vegetables, fish and shrimps they eat from this garden of theirs,there's still enough every year for people to take over under contract,and that at the close of each year there's a surplus in full of twohundred taels. Ever since that day is it that I've become alive to thefact that even a broken lotus leaf, and a blade of withered grass arealike worth money."
"This is, in very truth, the way wealthy and well-to-do people talk!"Pao-ch'ai laughed. "But notwithstanding your honourable position, youngladies, you really understand nothing about these concerns. Yet, haven'tyou, with all your book-lore, seen anything of the passage in thewriting of Chu Fu-tzu: 'Throw not they self away?'"
"I've read it, it's true," T'an Ch'un smiled, "but its object is simplyto urge people to exert themselves; it's as much empty talk as anyrandom arguments, and how could it be bodily treated as gospel?"
"Chu-tzu's work all as much empty talk as any random arguments?"Pao-ch'ai exclaimed. "Why every sentence in it is founded on fact.You've only had the management of affairs in your hands for a couple ofdays, and already greed and ambition have so beclouded your mind thatyou've come to look upon Chu-tzu as full of fraud and falsehood. Butwhen you by and bye go out into the world and see all those mightyconcerns reeking with greed and corruption, you'll even go so far as totreat Confucius himself as a fraud!"
"Haven't you with all your culture read a book like that of Chi-tzu's?"Pan Ch'un laughed. "Chi-tzu said in bygone days 'that when one descendsinto the arena where gain and emoluments are to be got, and enters theworld of planning and plotting, one makes light of the injunctions ofYao and Shun, and disregards the principles inculcated by Confucius andMencius.'"
"What about the next line?" Pao-ch'ai insinuated with a significantsmile.
"I now cut the text short," T'an Ch'un smilingly rejoined, "in order toadapt the sense to what I want to say. Would I recite the followingsentence, and heap abuse upon my own self; is it likely I would; eh?"
"There's nothing under the heavens that can't be turned to some use,"Pao-ch'ai added. "And since everything can be utilised, everything mustbe worth money. But can it be that a person gifted with suchintelligence as yours can have had no experience in such great mattersand legitimate concerns as these?"
"You send for a person," Li Wan laughingly interposed, 'and you don'tspeak about what's right and proper, but you start an argument onlearning."
"Learning is right and proper," Pao-ch'ai answered. "If we made noallusion to learning, we'd all soon enough drift among the rustic herd!"
The trio bandied words for a while, after which they turned theirattention again to pertinent affairs.
T'an Ch'un took up once more the thread of the conversation. "Thisgarden of ours," she argued, "is only half as big as theirs, so if youdouble the income they derive, you will see that we ought to reap a netprofit of four hundred taels a year. But were we also now to secure acontract for our surplus products, the money, we'd earn, would, ofcourse, be a mere trifle and not one that a family like ours shouldhanker after. And were we to depute two special persons (to attend tothe garden), the least permission given by them to any one to turnanything to improper uses, would, since there be so many things ofintrinsic value, be tantamount to a reckless destruction of the gifts ofheaven. So would it not be preferable to select several quiet, steadyand experienced old matrons, out of those stationed in the grounds, andappoint them to put them in order and look after things? Neither willthere be any need then to make them pay any rent, or give any taxes inkind. All we can ask them is to supply the household with whatever theycan afford during the year. In the first place, the garden will, withspecial persons to look after the plants and trees, naturally so improvefrom year to year that there won't be any bustle or confusion, wheneverthe time draws nigh to utilise the grounds. Secondly, people won'tventure to injure or uselessly waste anything. In the third place, theold matrons themselves will, by availing themselves of these smallperquisites, not labour in the gardens year after year and day after dayall for no good. Fourthly, it will in like manner be possible to effecta saving in the expenditure for gardeners, rockery-layers, sweepers andother necessary servants. And this excess can be utilised for making upother deficiencies. I don't see any reason why this shouldn't bepracticable!"
Pao-ch'ai was standing below contemplating the pictures with characterssuspended on the walls. Upon hearing these suggestions, she readilynodded her head assentingly and smiled. "Excellent!" she cried. "'Withinthree years, there will be no more famines and dearths.'"
"What a first-rate plan!" Li Wan chimed in. "This, if actually adopted,will delight the heart of Madame Wang. Pecuniary economies are ofthemselves a paltry matter; but there will be then in the garden thoseto sweep the grounds, and those whose special charge will be to lookafter them. Besides, were the persons selected allowed to turn up anhonest cash by selling part of the products, they will be so impelled bya sense of their responsibilities, and prompted by a desire of gain thatthere won't any longer be any who won't acquit themselves of theirduties to the fullest measure."
"It remained for you, miss, to put these suggestions in words," P'ingErh remarked. "Our mistress may have entertained the idea, but it is byno means certain that she thought it nice on her part to give utteranceto it. For as you, young ladies, live at present in the garden, shecould not possibly, unable as she is to supply such additional ornamentsas will make it more showy, contrariwise depute people to exerciseauthority in it, and to keep it in order, with a view of effecting areduction in expenses. Such a proposal could never have dropped from herlips."
Pao-ch'ai advanced up to her with alacrity. Rubbing her face: "Open thatmouth of yours wide," she laughed, "and let me see of what stuff yourteeth and tongue are made! Ever since you put your foot out of bed thismorning you've jabbered away up to this very moment! And your song hasall been in one strain. For neither have you been very complimentary toMiss Tertia, nor have you admitted that your mistress is, as far as witsgo, so much below the mark as to be unable to effect suitable provision.Yet whenever Miss Tertia advanced any arguments, you've at once made useof endless words to join issue with her. This is because the plandevised by Miss Tertia was also hit upon by your lady Feng. But theremust surely have been a reason why she couldn't carry it into execution.Again, as the young ladies have now their quarters in the garden, shecouldn't, with any decency, direct any one to go and rule over it, forthe mere sake of saving a few cash. Just consider this. If the garden isactually handed to people to make profit out of it, the partiesinterested will, of course, not even permit a single spray of flowers tobe plucked, and not a single fruit to be taken away. With such as comewithin the category of senior young ladies, they won't naturally havethe audacity to be particular; but they'll daily have endless rows withthe junior girls. (Lady Feng) has, with her fears about the future andher misgivings about the present, shown herself neither too overbearingnor too servile. This mistress of theirs is not friendly disposedtowards us, but when she hears of her various proposals, shame mightinduce her to turn over a new leaf."
"Early this morning," T'an Ch'un laughingly observed, "I was very cross,but as soon as I heard of her (P'ing Erh's) arrival, I casuallyremembered that her mistress employed, during her time, such domesticsas were up to all kinds of larks, and at the sight of her, I got morecross than ever. But, little though one would have thought it, shebehaved from the moment she came, like a rat that tries to get out ofthe way of a cat. And as she had had to stand for ever so long, I pitiedher very much; but she took up the thread of the conversation, and wenton to spin that long yarn of hers. Yet, instead of mentioning that hermistress treats me with every consideration, she, on the contrary,observed: 'The kindness with which you have all along dealt with ourlady miss, has not been to no purpose.' This remark therefore not onlydispelled my anger, but filled me with so much shame that I began tofeel sore at heart. And, when I came to think carefully over the matter,I failed to see how I, a mere girl, who had personally done so muchmischief that not a soul cared a straw for me and not a soul took anyinterest in me, could possess any such good qualities as to treat anyone kindly...."
When she reached this point, she could not check her tears from brimmingover. Li Wan and her associates perceived how pathetically she spoke;and, recalling to mind bow Mrs. Chao had always run her down, and howshe had ever been involved in some mess or other with Madame Wang, onaccount of this Mrs. Chao, they too found it difficult to refrain frommelting into sobs. But they then used their joint efforts to consoleher.
"Let's avail ourselves of this quiet day," they suggested, "to try andfind out how we could increase our revenue and remove abuses, so as notto render futile the charge laid on us by Madame Wang. What use orpurpose is it to allude to such trivial matters?"
"I've already grasped your object," P'ing Erh hastily ventured. "Miss,speak out; who do you consider fit? And as soon as the proper personshave been fixed upon, everything will be square enough."
"What you say is all very well," T'an Ch'un rejoined, "but it will benecessary to let your lady know something about it. It has never beenthe proper thing for us in here to scrape together any small profits.But as your mistress is full of gumption, I adopted the course I did.Had she been at all narrowminded, with many prejudices and manyjealousies, I wouldn't have shown the least willingness in the matter.But, as it will look as if I were bent upon pulling her to pieces, howcan I take action without consulting her?"
"In that case," P'ing Erh smiled, "I'll go and tell her something aboutit."
With this response, she went on the errand; and only returned after along lapse of time. "I said," she laughed, "that it would be perfectlyuseless for me to go. How ever could our lady not readily accede to anexcellent proposal like this?"
Hearing this, T'an Ch'un forthwith joined Li Wan in directing a servantto ask for the roll, containing the names of the matrons in the garden,and bring it to them. When produced, they all held council together, andfixing cursorily upon several persons, they summoned them to appearbefore them. Li Wan then explained to them the general outline of theirduties; and not one was there among the whole company, who listened toher, who would not undertake the charge. One said: "If you confide thatbamboo tree for twelve months to my care, it will again next year be asingle tree, but besides the shoots, which will have been eaten at home,I shall be able, in the course of the year, to also pay in some money.""Hand me over," another one remarked, "that portion of paddy field, andthere will, during the year, be no need to touch any public funds onaccount of the various birds, large and small, which are kept for merefun. Besides that, I shall be in a position to give in something more."
T'an Ch'un was about to pass a remark when a servant reported that thedoctor had come; and that he had entered the garden to see Miss Shih. Sothe matrons were obliged to go and usher the doctor in.
"Were there a hundred of you here," promptly expostulated P'ing Erh,"you wouldn't know what propriety means! Are there perchance no coupleof housekeepers about to push themselves forward and see the doctor in?"
"There's dame Wu and dame T'an," the servant, who brought the message,replied. "The two are on duty at the south-west corner at the'accumulated splendour' gate."
At this answer, P'ing Erh allowed the subject to drop.
After the departure of the matrons, T'an Ch'un inquired of Pao-ch'aiwhat she thought of them.
"Such as are diligent at the outset," Pao-ch'ai answered smiling,"become remiss in the end; and those who have a glib tongue have an eyeto gain."
T'an Ch'un listened to her reply; and nodding her head, she extolled itswisdom. Then showing them with her finger several names on the list, shesubmitted them for the perusal of the trio. P'ing Erh speedily went andfetched a pen and inkslab.
"This old mother Chu," the trio observed, "is a trustworthy woman.What's more, this old dame and her sons have generation after generationdone the sweeping of the bamboo groves. So let's now place the variousbamboo trees under her control. This old mother T'ien was originally afarmer, and everything in the way of vegetables and rice, in and aboutthe Tao Hsiang village, should, albeit they couldn't, planted as theyare as a mere pastime, be treated in such earnest as to call for largeworks and extensive plantations, be entrusted to her care; for won'tthey fare better if she can be on the spot and tend them with extradiligence at the proper times and seasons?"
"What a pity it is," T'an Ch'un proceeded smilingly, "that two places sospacious as the Heng Wu garden and the I Hung court bring no grit to themill."
"Things in the Heng Wu garden are in a worse state," Li Wan hastilyinterposed. "Aren't the scented wares and scented herbs sold at presenteverywhere in perfumery shops, large fairs and great temples the verycounterpart of these things here? So if you reckon up, you will find howmuch greater a return these articles will give than any other kind ofproduct. As for the I Hung court, we needn't mention other things, butonly take into account the roses that bud during the two seasons ofspring and summer; to how many don't they amount in all? Besides these,we've got along the whole hedge, cinnamon roses and monthly roses, stockroses, honey-suckle and westeria. Were these various flowers dried andsold to the tea and medicine shops, they'd also fetch a good deal ofmoney."
"Quite so!" T'an Ch'un acquiesced with a smile. "The thing is thatthere's no one with any notion how to deal with scented herbs."
"There's Ying Erh who waits on Miss Pao-ch'ai," P'ing Erh promptlysmiled. "Her mother is well-versed in these things. It was only theother day that she plucked a few, and plaited them, after drying themwell in the sun, into a flower-basket and a gourd, and gave them to meto play with. But miss can you have forgotten all about it?"
"I was this very minute speaking in your praise," Pao-ch'ai observedsmiling, "and do you come to chaff me?"
"What makes you say so?" exclaimed the trio, in utter astonishment.
"It will on no account do," Pao-ch'ai added. "You employ such a lot ofpeople in here that they all lead a lazy life and have nothing to put ahand to, and were I also now to introduce some more, that tribe willlook even upon me with utter contempt. But let me think of some one foryou. There's in the I Hung court, an old dame Yeh; she's Pei Ming'smother. That woman is an honest old lady; and is furthermore on the bestof terms with our Ying Erh's mother. So wouldn't it be well were thischarge given to this dame Yeh? Should there even be anything that shedoesn't know, there'll be no necessity for us to tell her. She can gostraightway and consult with Ying Erh's mother. And if she can't attendto everything herself, it won't matter to whom she relegates some of herduties. These will be purely private favours. In the event too of anyone making any mean insinuations, the blame won't fall on our shoulders.By adopting this course, you'll be managing things in such a way as todo extreme justice to all; and the trust itself will also be placed on amost satisfactory footing."
"Excellent!" ejaculated Li Wan and P'ing Erh simultaneously.
"This may be well and good," T'an Ch'un laughed, "but the fear is thatat the sight of gain, they'll forget all about propriety."
"That's nothing to do with us!" P'ing Erh rejoined a smile playing,about her lips. "It was only the other day that Ying Erh recognised dameYeh as her adopted mother, and invited her to eat and drink with them,so that the two families are on the most intimate terms."
At this assurance, T'an Ch'un relinquished the topic of conversation,and, holding council together, they selected several persons, all ofwhom the four had ever viewed with impartial favour and they marked offtheir names, by dotting them with a pen.
In a little while, the matrons came to report that 'the doctor hadgone;' and they handed the prescription. Their three mistresses thenperused its contents. On the one hand, they despatched domestics to takeit outside, so that the drugs should be got, and to superintend theirdecoction. On the other, T'an Ch'un and Li Wan explicitly explained tothe various servants chosen what particular place each had to lookafter. "Exclusive," they added, "of what fixed custom requires for homeconsumption during the four seasons, you are still at liberty to pluckwhatever remains and have it taken away. As for the profits, we'llsettle accounts at the close of the year."
"I've also bethought myself of something," T'an Ch'un smiled. "If thesettlement of accounts takes place at the end of the year, the moneywill, at the time of delivery, be naturally paid into the accountancy.Those high up will then as usual add a whole lot of controllers; andthese will, on their part, fleece their own share as soon as the moneygets into the palms of their hand. But as by this system, we've nowinitiated, you've been singled out for appointment, you've alreadyridden so far above their heads, that they foster all sorts of animosityagainst you. They don't, however, give vent to their feelings; but ifthey don't seize the close of the year, when you have to deliver youraccounts, to play their tricks on you, for what other chances will theywait? Moreover, they obtain, in everything that comes under theircontrol during the year, half of every share their masters get. This isan old custom. Every one is aware of its existence. But this is a newregime I now introduce in this garden, so don't let the money find itsway into their hands! Whenever the annual settling of accounts arrives,bring them in to us."
"My idea is," Pao-ch'ai smilingly suggested, "that no accounts need behanded even inside. This one will have a surplus, that one a deficit, sothat it will involve no end of trouble; wouldn't it be better thereforeif we were to find out who of them would take over this or thatparticular kind and let them purvey the various things? These are forthe exclusive use of the inmates of the garden; and I've already made anestimate of them for you. They amount to just a few sorts, and simplyconsist of head-oil, rouge, powder and scented paper; in all of which,the young ladies and maids are subject to a fixed rule. Then, besidesthese, there are the brooms, dust-baskets and poles, wanted in differentlocalities, and the food for the large and small animals and birds, andthe deer and rabbits. These are the only kinds of things required. Andif they contract for them, there'll be little need for any one to go tothe accountancy for money. But just calculate what a saving will thus beeffected!"
"All these items are, I admit, mere trifles," P'ing Erh smiled, "but ifyou lump together what's used during a year, you will find that a savingof four hundred taels will be effected."
"Again!" smilingly remarked Pao-ch'ai, "it would be four hundred taelsin one year; but eight hundred taels in two years; and with these, wecould purchase a few more houses and let them; and in the way of poor,sandy land we could also add several acres to those we've already got.'There will, of course, still remain a surplus; but as they will haveample trouble and inconvenience to put up with during the year, theyshould also be allowed some balance in hand so as to make up what'swanted for themselves. The main object is, of course, to increaseprofits and curtail expenses, yet we couldn't be stingy to any excessivedegree. In fact, were we even able to make any further economy of overtwo or three hundred taels, it would never be the proper thing; shouldthis involve a breach of the main principles of decorum. With thiscourse duly put into practice, outside, the accountancy will issue inone year four or five hundred taels less, without even the semblance ofany parsimony; while, inside, the matrons will obtain, on the otherhand, some little thing to supply their wants with; the nurses, who haveno means of subsistence, will likewise be placed in easy circumstances;and the plants and trees in the garden will year by year increase instrength and grow more abundantly. In this wise, you too will have sucharticles as will be fit for use. So that this plan will, to some extent,not constitute a breach of the high principles of propriety. And if everwe want to retrench a little more from where won't we be able to getmoney? But if the whole balance, if any, be put to the credit of thepublic fund, every one, inside as well as outside, will fill the streetswith the din of murmurings! And won't this be then a slur upon the codeof honour of a household such as yours? So were any charge to beentrusted to this one, out of the several tens of old nurses at presentemployed in the garden, and not to that one, the remainder willnaturally resent such injustice. As I said a while back all that thesewomen will have to provide among themselves amounts to a few articles,so they will unavoidably have ample means. Hence each should be told tocontribute, beyond the articles that fall to her share during the year,a certain number of tiaos, whether she may or may not realise anybalance, and then jointly lump these sums together, and distribute themamong those nurses only on service in the garden. For although they maynot have anything to do with the control of these things, theythemselves will have to stay in the grounds, to keep an eye over theservants on duty, to shut the doors, to close the windows and to get upearly and retire late. Whenever it rains in torrents or it snows hardand chairs have to be carried, for you, young ladies, to go out and comein; or boats have to be punted, and sledges drawn, these rough andarduous duties come alike within their sphere of work. They have tolabour in the garden from one year's end to the other, and though, theyearn something in those grounds, it's only right that they should ableto get some small benefits in the discharge of their legitimate duties.But there's another most trivial point that I would broach with lessreserve. If you only think of your ease, and don't share the profitswith them, they will, of course, never presume to show theirdispleasure, but in their hearts they won't cherish you any goodfeeling. What they'll do will be to make public business a pretext toserve their own private ends with; they'll pluck more of your fruitsthan they should; and cut greater quantities of your flowers than theyought. And you people will have a grievance, but you won't have anywhereto go and confide it. But should they too reap some gain, they'llreadily look after such things on your behalf as you won't have the timeto attend to."
The matrons listened to her explanations; (and finding that) they wouldbe removed from the control of the accountancy, that they would not becompelled to go and settle accounts with lady Feng, and that all thatthey would be called upon to do every year would be to supply a few moretiaos, were each and all delighted to an exceptional degree. So much so,that every one of them exclaimed in a chorus that they were quiteprepared to agree to the terms. "It is better," they said, "than to beobliged to go out and be squeezed by them; and to have to fork out ourown money as well."
Those too not entrusted with the care of any portion of land were alsohighly elated, when they heard that at the close of each year theywould, though they had no valid claim, come in for some share of hardcash.
"They'll have to bear the trouble," they however argued, "to keep thingsin order, so it's only right that they should be left with a few cash tomeet their various wants with; and how could we very well gobble ourthree meals without doing a stroke of work?"
"Worthy dames," Pao-ch'ai smiled, "you mustn't decline. These duties arewithin your province and you should fulfil them. All you need do is toexert yourselves a bit by day and night, and not be so remiss andcareless as to suffer any of the servants to drink and gamble; that'sall. Otherwise, I myself must have nothing to do with the control. Butyou, yourselves, know well enough that it's my aunt who appealed to mewith her own lips three and five times to do it as a favour to her.'Your eldest sister-in-law,' she represented, 'has at present noleisure, and the other girls are young,' and then she asked me to lookafter things. So if I now don't accede, it's as clear as day that Ishall be the cause of much worry to my aunt. Our lady Feng herself isseriously ill, and our domestic affairs can't hang fire. I'm really withnothing to do, so were even a mere neighbour to solicit my help, I wouldalso feel bound to lend her a hand in her pressure of work. How muchmore therefore when it's my own aunt, who invokes my aid? Setting asidethe way I'm execrated by one and all, how would I ever be able to staremy aunt in the face, if, while I gave my sole mind to winning fame andfishing for praise, any one got so intoxicated and lost so much ingambling as to stir up trouble? At such a juncture remorse on your partwill be too late! Even the old reputation you have ever enjoyed willentirely be lost and gone. Those young ladies and girls and this vastgarden are alike placed under your supervision, purely and simplybecause one takes into account that you have been nurses to three orfour generations and that you have most scrupulously observed the rulesof etiquette and propriety. It's but fair that you should try, with onemind, and show some little regard for what's right and proper. But ifyou contrariwise behave with such laxity as to let people gratify theirwishes by guzzling and gambling, and my aunt comes to hear of these nicedoings, a little scolding from her will be of little consequence. But ifthe various women, who attend to the household, get scent of the stateof affairs, they will haul you over the coals, without even so much asbreathing one single word beforehand to my aunt. And venerable people,though you are, you will then, instead of tendering advice to youngpeople, be called to account by them. As housekeepers, they exercise,it's true, authority over you; but why shouldn't you yourselves observea certain amount of decorum? And if you do so, will they have anyoccasion to bully you? The reason why I've now bethought myself of thisspecial boon for you is that you should unanimously strain every nerveto diligently attend to the garden, in order that the powers that bemay, at the sight of your unrelenting care and zeal, have no cause togive way to solicitude. And won't they inwardly look up to you withregard? Neither will you render of no effect the various benefitsdevised for them. But go now and minutely ponder over all my advice!"
All the women received her words with gratification. "What you say isquite right," they replied. "From this time forth you, miss, and you,our lady, can well compose your minds. With the interest both of youfeel on our behalf, may heaven and earth not spare us, if we do notdisplay a full amount of gratitude for all your kindnesses."
These assurances were still being uttered when they saw Lin Chih-hsiao'swife walk in. "The family of the Chen mansion of Chiang Nan," sheexplained, "arrived in the capital yesterday. To-day, they're going intothe palace to offer their congratulations. But they've now sentmessengers ahead to come and bring presents and pay their respects."
While she spoke, she produced the list of presents and handed it up.T'an Ch'un took it over from her. "They consist," she said, perusing it,"of twelve rolls of brocades and satins embroidered with dragons, suchas are for imperial use; twelve rolls of satins of various colours, ofthe kind worn by the Emperor; twelve rolls of every sort of imperialgauze; twelve rolls of palace silks of the quality used by his majesty;and twenty rolls of satins, gauzes, silks and thin silks of differentcolours, generally worn by officials."
After glancing over the list, Li Wan and T'an Ch'un suggested that afirst-class tip should be given to the messengers who brought them,after which, they went on to direct a servant to convey the tidings todowager lady Chia.
Old lady Chia gave orders to call Li Wan, T'an Ch'un, Pao-ch'ai and theother girls. On their arrival, the presents were passed under review;and this over, Li Wan put them aside. "You must wait," she said to theservants of the inner store-room, "until Madame Wang comes back and seesthem; you can then lock them up."
"This Chen family too," old lady Chia thereupon added, "isn't like anyother family; the highest tips should therefore be conferred upon themen. But as in a twinkle, they may also send some of their womankind tocome and make their obeisance, silks should be got ready inanticipation."
Scarcely was this remark concluded before a domestic actually announced:'that four ladies of the Chen mansion had come to pay their respects.'
Upon hearing this, dowager lady Chia hastily directed that they shouldbe introduced into her presence. The four women ranged from forty yearsand over. Their clothing and head-gear were not, in any material degree,different from those of mistresses. As soon as they presented theircompliments and inquired about their healths, old lady Chia desired thatfour footstools should be moved forward. But though the four womenthanked her for bidding them sit down, they only occupied the stools,after Pao-ch'ai had seated herself.
"When did you enter the capital?" old lady Chia inquired.
The four women jumped to their feet with alacrity. "We entered thecapital yesterday," they answered. "Our lady has taken our young ladytoday into the palace to pay their homage. That's why she bade us comeand give you their compliments, and see how the young ladies are gettingon."
"You hadn't paid a visit to the capital for ever so many years," dowagerlady Chia smilingly observed, "and here you appear now quiteunexpectedly!"
The four women simultaneously smiled again. "Quite so!" they said. "Wereceived this year imperial orders, summoning us to the capital!"
"Has the whole family come?" old lady Chia asked.
"Our old mistress, our young master, the two young ladies and the otherladies haven't come up," the four women explained. "Only our lady hascome, together with Miss Tertia."
"Is she engaged to any one?" old lady Chia asked.
"Not yet," rejoined the quartet.
"The two families, that of your senior married lady and that of yourlady Secunda are both on most intimate terms with ours," dowager ladyChia smilingly added.
"Yes, they are," replied the four women with a smile. "The lettersreceived each year from our young ladies, assure us that they'reentirely dependent upon the kindness bestowed upon them, in your worthymansion, for their well-being."
"What kindness?" old lady Chia exclaimed laughingly. "These two familiesare really friends of long standing. In addition to this, they're oldrelatives. So what we do is our simple bounden duty. What's more in thefavour of your two young ladies is, that they're not full of their ownimportance. That's how it is that we've come to be on such close terms."
The four women smiled. "This is mainly due to your venerable ladyship'sexcessive humility," they answered.
"Is that young gentleman of yours too with your old mistress?" old ladyChia went on to inquire.
"Yes, he has also come with our old mistress," the four women retorted.
"How old is he?" old lady Chia then asked. "Does he go to school?" sheafterwards inquired.
"He's thirteen this year," the four women said by way of response. "Butall through those good looks of his, our old mistress cherishes him sofondly that from his youth up, he has been wayward to the extreme, andthat he now daily plays the truant. But our master and mistress as welldon't keep any great check over him."
"Yet, he can't resemble that young fellow of ours," old lady Chialaughed. "What's the name of your young gentleman?"
"As our old mistress treats him just like a real precious gem," thequartet explained, "and as his complexion is naturally so white, herladyship calls him Pao-yue."
"Here's another one with the name of Pao-yue!" old lady Chia laughinglysaid to Li Wan.
Li Wan and her companions hastily made a curtsey. "There have been, fromold times to the present," they smiled, "very many among contemporariesand persons of different generations as well, who have borne duplicatenames."
The four women also smiled. "After the selection of this infant name,"they proceeded, "we all, both high or low, began to give way tosurmises, as we could not make out in what relative's or friend's familythere was a lad also called by the same name. But as we hadn't come tothe capital for ten years or so, we couldn't remember."
"That young fellow is my grandson," dowager lady Chia remarked. "Hallo!some one come here!"
The married women and maids assented and approached several steps.
"Go into the garden," old lady Chia smilingly said, "and call our Pao-yuehere, so that these four housekeeping dames should see how he compareswith their own Pao-yue."
The married women, upon hearing her orders, promptly went off. After awhile, they entered the room pressing round Pao-yue. The moment the fourdames caught sight of him, they speedily rose to their feet. "He hasgiven us such a start!" they exclaimed smilingly. "Had we not come intoyour worthy mansion, and perchance, met him, elsewhere, we would havetaken him for our own Pao-yue, and followed him as far as the capital."
While speaking they came forward and took hold of his hands and assailedhim with questions.
Pao-yue however also put on a smile and inquired after their healths.
"How do his looks compare with those of your young gentleman?" dowagerlady Chia asked as she smiled.
"The way the four dames ejaculated just now," Li Wan and her companionsexplained, "was sufficient to show how much they resemble in looks."
"How could there ever he such a coincidence?" old lady Chia laughed."Yet, the children of wealthy families are so delicately nurtured thatunless their faces are so deformed as to make them downright ugly,they're all equally handsome, as far as general appearances go. Sothere's nothing strange in this!"
"As we gaze at his features," the quartet added, with smiling faces, "wefind him the very image of him; and from what we gather from yourvenerable ladyship, he's also like him in waywardness. But, as far as wecan judge, this young gentleman's disposition is ever so much betterthan that of ours."
"What makes you think so?" old lady Chia precipitately inquired.
"We saw it as soon as we took hold of the young gentleman's hands," thefour women laughingly rejoined, "and when he spoke to us. Had it beenthat fellow of ours, he would have simply called us fools. Not to speakof taking his hand in ours, why we daren't even slightly move any of histhings. That's why, those who wait on him are invariably young girls."
Before the four dames had time to conclude what they had to say, Li Wanand the rest found it so hard to check themselves that with one voicethey burst into loud laughter.
Old lady Chia also laughed. "Let's also send some one now," she said,"to have a look at your Pao-yue. When his hand is taken, he too is sureto make an effort to put up with it. But don't you know that children offamilies such as yours and mine are bound, notwithstanding theirnumerous perverse and strange defects, to return the orthodoxcivilities, when they come across any strangers. But should they notreturn the proper civilities, they should, by no manner of means, besuffered to behave with such perverseness. It's the way that grown-uppeople doat on them that makes them what they are. And as they can,first and foremost, boast of bewitching good looks and they comportthemselves, secondly, towards visitors with all propriety--, in fact,with less faulty deportment than their very seniors--, they manage towin the love and admiration of such as only get a glimpse of them. Henceit is that they're secretly indulged to a certain degree. But if theydon't show the least regard to any one inside or outside, and so reflectno credit upon their parents, they deserve, with all their handsomelooks, to be flogged to death."
These sentiments evoked a smile from the four dames. "Your wordsvenerable lady," they exclaimed, "are quite correct. But though ourPao-yue be wilful and strange in his ways, yet, whenever he meets anyvisitors, he behaves with courteousness and good manners; so much so,that he's more pleasing to watch than even grown-up persons. There is noone, therefore, who sees him without falling in love with him. Butyou'll say: 'why is he then beaten?' You really aren't aware that athome he has no regard either for precept or for heaven; that he comesout with things that never suggest themselves to the imagination ofgrown-up people, and that he does everything that takes one by surprise.The result is that his father and mother are driven to their wits' ends.But wilfulness is natural to young children. Reckless expenditure is acommon characteristic of young men. Antipathy to school is a commonfeeling with young people. Yet there are ways and means to bring himround. The worse with him is that his disposition is so crotchety andwhimsical. Can this ever do?...."
This reply was barely ended when a servant informed them that theirmistress had returned. Madame Wang entered the room, and saluted thewomen. The four dames paid their obeisance to her. But they had just hadsufficient time to pass a few general observations, when dowager ladyChia bade them go and rest. Madame Wang then handed the tea in personand withdrew from the apartment. But when the four dames got up to saygood-bye, old lady Chia adjourned to Madame Wang's quarters. After achat with her on domestic affairs, she however told the women to goback; so let us put them by without any further allusion to them.
During this while, old lady Chia's spirits waxed so high, that she toldevery one and any one she came across that there was another Pao-yue, andthat he was, in every respect, the very image of her grandson.
But as each and all bore in mind that there were many inmates among thelarge households of those officials with official ancestors, called bythe same names, that it was an ordinary occurrence for a grandmother tobe passionately fond of her grandson, and that there was nothingout-of-the-way about it, they treated the matter as of no significance.Pao-yue alone however was such a hair-brained simpleton that heconjectured that the statements made by the four dames had been intendedto flatter his grandmother Chia.
But subsequently he betook himself into the garden to see how ShihHsiang-yuen was getting on.
"Compose your mind now," Shih Hsiang-yuen then said to him, "and go onwith your larks! Once, you were as lonely as a single fibre, which can'tbe woven into thread, and like a single bamboo, which can't form agrove, but now you've found your pair. When you exasperate your parents,and they give you beans, you'll be able to bolt to Nanking in quest ofthe other Pao-yue."
"What utter rubbish!" Pao-yue exclaimed. "Do you too believe that there'sanother Pao-yue?"
"How is it," Hsiang-yuen asked, "that there was some one in the Liehstate called Lin Hsiang-ju, and that during the Han dynasty there livedagain another person, whose name was Ssu Ma Hsiang-ju?"
"This matter of names is all well enough," Pao-yue rejoined with a smile."But as it happens, his very appearance is the counterpart of mine. Sucha thing could never be!"
"How is it," Hsiang-yuen inquired, "that when the K'uang people sawConfucius, they fancied it was Yang Huo?"
"Confucius and Yang Huo," Pao-yue smilingly argued, "may have been alikein looks, but they hadn't the same names. Lin and Ssu were again,notwithstanding their identical names, nothing like each other inappearances. But can it ever be possible that he and I should resembleeach other in both respects?"
Hsiang-yuen was at a loss what reply to make to his arguments. "You may,"she consequently remarked smiling, "propound any rubbish you like, I'mnot in the humour to enter into any discussion with you. Whether therebe one or not is quite immaterial to me. It doesn't concern me at all."
Saying this, she lay herself down.
Pao-yue however began again to exercise his mind with further surmises."If I say," he cogitated, "that there can't be one, there seems from allappearances to be one. And if I say that there is one, I haven't, on theother hand, seen him with my own eyes."
Sad and dejected he returned therefore to his quarters, and reclining onhis couch, he silently communed with his own thoughts until heunconsciously became drowsy and fell fast asleep.
Finding himself (in his dream) in some garden or other, Pao-yue wasseized with astonishment. "Besides our own garden of Broad Vista," hereflected, "is there another such garden?" But while indulging in thesespeculations, several girls, all of whom were waiting-maids, suddenlymade their appearance from the opposite direction. Pao-yue was againfilled with surprise. "Besides Yuean Yang, Hsi Jen and P'ing Erh," hepondered, "are there verily such maidens as these?"
"Pao-yue!" he heard that company of maids observe, with faces beamingwith smiles, "how is it you find yourself in here?"
Pao-yue laboured under the impression that they were addressing him. Withhasty step, he consequently drew near them, and returned their smiles."I got here," he answered, "quite listlessly. What old family friend'sgarden is this, I wonder? But sisters, pray, take me for a stroll."
The maids smiled with one consent. "Really!" they exclaimed, "this isn'tour Pao-yue. But his looks too are spruce and nice; and he is asprecocious too with his tongue."
Pao-yue caught their remarks. "Sisters!" he eagerly cried, "is thereactually a second Pao-yue in here?"
"As for the two characters 'Pao-yue,'" the maids speedily explained,"every one in our house has received our old mistress' and our mistress'injunctions to use them as a spell to protract his life for many yearsand remove misfortune from his path, and when we call him by that name,he simply goes into ecstasies, at the very mention of it. But you, youngbrat, from what distant parts of the world do you hail that you'verecklessly been also dubbed by the same name? But beware lest we poundthat frowzy flesh of yours into mincemeat."
"Let's be off at once!" urged another maid, as she smiled. "Don't letour Pao-yue see us here and say again that by hobnobbing with thisstinking young fellow, we've been contaminated by all his pollution."
With these words on her lips, they straightway walked off.
Pao-yue fell into a brown study. "There's never been," he mused, "any oneto treat me with such disdain before! But what is it, in fact, thatinduces them to behave towards me in this manner? May it not be truethat there lives another human being the very image of myself?"
While lost in reverie, he advanced with heedless step, until he reacheda courtyard. Pao-yue was struck with wonder. "Is there actually," hecried, "besides the I Hung court another court like it?" Spontaneouslythen ascending the steps, he entered an apartment, in which he discernedsome one reclining on a couch. On the off side sat several girls, busyat needlework; now laughing joyfully; now practising their jokes; whenhe overheard the young person on the couch heave a sigh.
"Pao-yue," smilingly inquired a maid, "what, aren't you asleep? What areyou once more sighing for? I presume it's because your sister is illthat you abandon yourself again to idle fears and immoderate anguish!"
These words fell on Pao-yue's ears, and took him quite aback.
"I've heard grandmother say," he overheard the young person on the couchobserve, "that there lives at Ch'ang An, the capital, another Pao-yueendowed with the same disposition as myself. I never believed what shetold me; but I just had a dream, and in this dream I found myself in agarden of the metropolis where I came across several maidens; all ofwhom called me a 'stinking young brat,' and would have nothing whateverto do with me. But after much difficulty, I succeeded in penetratinginto his room. He happened to be fast asleep. There he lay like a merebag of bones. His real faculties had flown somewhere or other; whitherit was hard for me to say."
Hearing this, "I've come here," Pao-yue said with alacrity, "in search ofPao-yue; and are you, indeed, that Pao-yue?"
The young man on the couch jumped down with all haste and enfolded himin his arms. "Are you verily Pao-yue?" he laughingly asked. "This isn'tby any means such stuff as dreams are made of!"
"How can you call this a dream?" Pao-yue rejoined. "It's reality, yea,nothing but reality!"
But scarcely was this rejoinder over, than he heard some one come, andsay: "our master, your father, wishes to see you, Pao-yue."
The two lads started with fear. One Pao-yue rushed off with all despatch.The other promptly began to shout, "Pao-yue! come back at once! Pao-yue;be quick and return!"
Hsi Jen, who stood by (Pao-yue), heard him call out his own name, in hisdreams, and immediately gave him a push and woke him up. "Where isPao-yue gone to?" she laughed.
Although Pao-yue was by this time aroused from sleep, his senses were asyet dull, so pointing towards the door, "He's just gone out," hereplied, "he's not far off."
Hsi Jen laughed. "You're under the delusion of a dream," she said. "Rubyour eyes and look carefully! It's your reflection in the mirror."
Pao-yue cast a glance in front of him, and actually caught sight of thelarge inlaid mirror, facing him quite opposite, so he himself burst outlaughing. But, presently, a maid handed him a rince-bouche and tea andsalt, and he washed his mouth.
"Little wonder is it," She Yueeh ventured, "if our old mistress hasrepeatedly enjoined that it isn't good to have too many mirrors about inyoung people's rooms, for as the spirit of young persons is not fullydeveloped there is every fear, with mirrors casting their reflectionsall over the place, of their having wild dreams in their sleep. And is abed now placed before that huge mirror there? When the covers of themirrors are let down, no harm can befall; but as the season advances,and the weather gets hot, one feels so languid and tired, that is onelikely to think of dropping them? Just as it happened a little timeback; it slipped entirely from your memory. Of course, when he first gotinto bed, he must have played with his face towards the glass; but uponshortly closing his eyes, he must naturally have fallen into suchconfused dreams, that they thoroughly upset his rest. Otherwise, how isit possible that he should have started shouting his own name? Would itnot be as well if the bed were moved inside to-morrow? That's the properplace for it."
Hardly had she, however, done, before they perceived a servant, sent byMadame Wang to call Pao-yue. But what she wanted to tell him is not yetknown, so, reader, listen to the circumstances recorded in thesubsequent chapter.
